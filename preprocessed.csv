0,Gabriel Leydon - How Web3 Onboards a Billion Users,Introduction," Patrick: My guest today is Gabe Leydon, whose episode last year was one of our most popular ever. Gabe has spent the last 20 years designing video games and is one of the most original thinkers I know. He was the co-founder of Machine Zone, which pioneered free-to-play hits like Mobile Strike and Game of War. Over the past year, he has been in stealth mode building a Web 2.0 meets Web 3.0 video game company called Limit Break, which is founded on a brand new business model that he calls free-to-own. We dive into his vision for the future of gaming, how it could onboard a billion users onto the Ethereum network and why the LTVs of crypto gamers are so far higher than those of their Web 2.0 counterparts. Please enjoy this great conversation with Gabe Leydon",183
1,Gabriel Leydon - How Web3 Onboards a Billion Users,Free-to-Own Gaming," Patrick: All right, Gabe, so it's been almost exactly a year since our first conversation, which remains probably our biggest hit of the last year. In the intervening year, you've been building a new business called Limit Break. Gabriel: Sorta thanks to you. Patrick: Partly thanks to me and I'm an investor in the business. Yeah. Gabriel: Not just because of that, because of the episode. Patrick: Well I hope I had a small part. But we get to revisit a lot of those ideas because you basically been a learning machine in the year since building probably more actively than anyone else in the Web 3.0 space, which is ironic. So much talk and not much building. But you and the team have done a lot of innovating in that world. I think we need to start with this concept that you've just released to the public called free-to-own one of the key builders and innovators in the free-to-play mobile video game space. And I think you believe pretty deeply that that era might be sun setting and free-to-own as a concept is the next wave of how games are built and monetized. So I'd love you to give or treat us on free-to-own what it means and why it's exciting to you. Gabriel: Well, it's the next level of free, first of all. I can definitely talk about this subject probably like 30 minutes straight. But first of all, the reason free-to-play took off was because of piracy. They were making PC games and Nexon was tired of getting their games pirated. So they said, ""Let's just give our game away free."" That was the beginning of free-to-play. And it was attractive to gamers who had to pay up front for a game. That's why they were pirating in the first place because they didn't want to. So they said, ""Well look, now I'm going to just try this."" So the term free-to-play, what it means is you're free-to-play it. You can play it whenever you want. It doesn't cost you anything to play it. You just download it and play it. That's a big step in distribution, player sentiment. They're very happy that the game is free, but then when they play the game, they start buying items. Essentially, that's what happens. There's items stores, there's virtual currency stores and they have to buy those. So the early criticism of free-to-play was, especially by people who didn't understand it, they said, ""Well the game isn't really free because you have to buy upgrades inside the game. So it's not really free."" But of course that didn't really matter to anybody. And now vast majority of the business is free-to-play, soon to be all of it.So the next step in all of that is we have these items in the store that we sell to people in free-to-play. They're all Web 2.0 locked on a server and the developer completely controls them and they decide basically everything about those items. So you have to buy them and then you hope that they remain relevant. So the next step is free-to-own, which is essentially an extension on free-to-play, except we move what's free a step further. It's not just the game that's free now, you can get virtual items that could potentially have value before you even play the game. So we're abstracting the items that everyone's paying for already. So 120 billion a year of items are sold essentially every year on mobile phones. Now we say, okay, not only is the game free, you can download and play it, but before you do it, here's some important items in the game. So now the players have ownership and it's a Web 3.0 item, it's not a Web 2.0 item. So they don't have to pay for the game, they don't have to pay for the item. Now they're incentivized. They're like, ""I hope this game does well. I have this item. It's a rare item, it's a provable, one of one item in a game and if this game takes off, maybe other people will want it from me.""And I think the simple explanation of it is that we're taking the free-to-play economy, we're putting that on Web 3.0 and we're giving it out. And the reason why that's so important, and a lot of people in Web 3.0 criticized say, ""Well people have done free stuff before."" But they didn't brand it right, they didn't call it a category. They're not saying it's the next thing. They just did it. So what I'm trying to do here is say no, this is what's going to replace free-to-play. And how it replaces free-to-play is going to be impossible to just do the same old item store thing moving forward. And the opportunity is, I think I read today, there's only 60,000 daily wallets on Ethereum that own an NFT, that's 60,000 daily users is nothing. As a result, Web 3.0 gaming doesn't look like a thing. It looks fake in a way. You have one big game with Axie and it's big, it's had some issues but they've innovated a ton, but they've got something like 800,000 monthly players. It's respectable. And then the number two game has like 10,000. And the number 10 game has like a hundred. So basically it's not a thing, it's not a real thing. Patrick: Web 3.0 gaming is not a thing. Gabriel: No, it's not a real thing yet. Not yet. It will be very shortly. And the reason why is because everybody's been saying do this land sale, buy this land sale and the land costs $7,000 because that's what it costs. When the game comes out, it's going to be great. And the player sitting there going, ""Gosh, if the game is really big, my land is going to be worth 30 grand or something, right?"" They're so excited about it versus just giving it to him for free, getting the exact same effect, the exact same effect, but more with them thinking this is awesome, this could actually be the next big game and I own a piece of this. And as a result, I think we go from 60,000 daily wallets to a billion very fast. Very, very fast.We just saw on Reddit, there was a controversy with their NFTs that they just put out. People are like, ""Oh, we don't like NFTs."" But they gave them for free and it changed the sentiment on Reddit overnight. There's still some people that don't like it, but overall the sentiment changed a ton when they didn't have to pay for it. Free-to-own games are how the world on boards to Ethereum. And once we get those 3 billion gamers on Ethereum, I think the gaming business goes from 200 billion a year to 6 trillion a year. Very quickly. Patrick: Why 6 trillion? Gabriel: Because I think it's a 30x, mainly because of the unrestricted nature of the payment rail that we're on. I think you and I talked about this before, but everything is throttled by paper money, $20 bills, $50 bills, $100 bills. Products are designed around those bills. 19.99, 49.99, the world designs products around these denominations because of the anchoring that was set. Think about it?When was that anchoring set? 70 years ago? Something like that. A hundred years ago. Who knows? Long time ago. And the dollar is worth 99% less. Patrick: There's no $10,000 bill. That would be the equivalent probably. Gabriel: Yeah. But people still think in terms of $20 bills. They do. It's very important to have skews at 19.99. Anybody who makes products will tell you that. 99.99. So Ethereum is a huge reset on all of that. Now it's one ETH, one ETH. You see all these people talking about it this way. I say a different way. It's a different way of thinking. Also, the big change, the obvious change, oh, I don't know if it's so obvious actually, is if you go to the app store and you make a game, the biggest in-app purchase you can do is a hundred dollars. And that's limited by Apple. Google also just copied it, said, okay, we can only do a hundred dollars. Yet you see these Bored Apes selling for 2 million.If you take the average person and you show them an item in a game and you show them a Bored Ape, will they be able to tell a difference? No, they won't. All of that behavior that you're seeing on Ethereum with profile pictures this crazy, like $500,000, $2 million, whatever, all of that behavior is preexisting behavior. None of it is new. It's been around in games forever. People have been spending tremendous amount of money in games forever, more than they've ever spent on a Bored Ape or whatever, a lot more. But they did it through credit cards, they did it through in-app purchases. Ethereum is the equivalent to wire, an instant wiring system except with a different currency with Ethereum. And it allows people to express their behavior, their preexisting behavior in more upfront ways, like what you see with the PFPs.And I think it's super important to recognize that none of this is new. None of it is new. It's been going on in games for 20 years. I've seen it up close. It's not new. Except now we have the ability to give you ownership of that item, which is super important. And the potential for desire for the item is worldwide. Everybody in the world could want that one item that is provably yours. What does it go to? A billion dollars? A billion dollar NFT? And it's hard to imagine, but what is it 500x more than what we're already seeing. We already saw 70 million NFT. We're at 14x more than what we've already seen with only 60,000 active wallets. Is that really that crazy? Patrick: Can you just clearly define the preexisting behavior that you referenced that you've seen before? I want to make sure we fully described the thing being tapped into. Gabriel: People are willing to spend a lot of money on virtual items. They're willing to do it. They love it, they like it. They do 120 billion every year on their mobile phone. And if you show someone an NFT and you show them the item they're buying the game, those people won't be able to tell the difference. But if they understood that one was property and one was not, they're going to prefer the property, obviously. And there's a lot of pushback in the gamer community around NFTs. You got to remember that $120 billion is generated probably about 8% of the people who play the games. It's a vast minority. And there's nothing anybody can tell me that would convince me that those people don't want an NFT. Why wouldn't they?",2536
2,Gabriel Leydon - How Web3 Onboards a Billion Users,Three Waves of NFTs," Patrick: Can you say a little bit about this progression in the world of NFTs from PFPs, which is, we'll just call that the Bored Ape category to what you're calling clubs. Gabriel: They were the second version. Patrick: CryptoPunks, maybe it was V1. Gabriel: Yeah, CryptoPunks would be like a PFP version one, very early NFT. And then version two would be what we just went through, which is a lot of non-technical teams making NFTs and then getting a big audience around them and frankly not knowing what to do. Patrick: Having all this capital and just sitting on them. Gabriel: And they would just send people stickers and stuff. So they just literally, they would send you a sticker, a t-shirt, a fanny pack and they would say, ""You're part of the club, you got the fanny pack, you got the sticker, you're now a part of the club."" But just see that as what I would do if I didn't have any engineers either. I would also do that. But I think that phase is going to quickly go away and move into more, this is all software, this all virtual items.So there's a lot of unique things that you can do online with an NFT if you have a serious engineering team that is building new solutions. And of course all these things are going to plug into games and they'll be interoperable between other games. That'll be what NFTs are mainly for. Moving from one virtual universe to the next. Limit Break is pushing into that. My new company's pushing into that version three, which is constantly updating, always adding new features, creating new technology around the products. That's where I think everything's going. So NFTs are about to get a lot more exciting now too, because it's not just about getting a t-shirt or whatever. You're actually be able to interact with lots of different software with your NFT. Patrick: I want to get much deeper into that interactivity and what you've already done with the Digi NFTs. Before we do that, I just want to talk business model a little bit. So as I understand it, obviously one way to do this would be the land sale, you make seven grand a sale, the company makes a seven grand, straightforward. Gabriel: No, they make like 70 million in a day. Patrick: I mean per though. Gabriel: And that's been pretty normal. I think it's actually been the biggest reason why Web 3.0 games haven't took off. Because it was normal to make 50 million in a day or a hundred. And it didn't just happen once. It happened, I don't know, maybe a hundred times. So there's something there. If you can do 50 million in a day, a hundred times in industry with only 60,000 people, really, maybe 100,000 at the peak, there's something there, but it's not going to exactly bring in the masses. Patrick: We were talking about one example over text, six months ago or something. And I think my response was like, ""This is so fucking dumb."" And you were like, ""Patrick, how many times do you need to see this before you understand the potential here? It's a tiny number of people with a crazy amount of money?"" Gabriel: It's not something that happened one time. It's something that happened 100 times. Patrick: Yeah. In terms of onboarding a billion people, not 60,000 people, the role of free is critical, but then the business model gets pushed further down. So as I understand it, it is ongoing participation in the transaction volume, the dollar transaction volume for the company. Gabriel: So we're building free-to-play games, mobile free-to-play games. We can't do Web 3 on mobile yet. Do you think it'll eventually happen, but not yet. You have to build a bridge, first of all, so you have to build a free-to-play game, high quality, something that you can distribute worldwide, mobile free-to-play game. That's the only way to get scale. And you have to build a specific crypto version of that game to bridge those players over. Patrick: In the browser? Gabriel: No there's a PC. Axie has two-thirds of their traffic that's on side loaded Android apps. Honestly, I think Android is actually where a lot of the action's going to be, the Android and PC Mac. Patrick: All right. So we've got this model where you're building a traditional game that you've obviously spent your career building, traditional mobile, traditional free-to-play. And on the other side, building this set of NFT projects and almost like a game embedded in the NFTs that we'll talk about with Digi. But the business model for Limit Break is twofold then, it sounds like. The first part is traditional free-to-play. The second part is participating in some of the transaction dollar volume or E volume on the trading of the NFTs. Gabriel: What's exciting about E is it's programmable. When I work with in-app purchase, Google in-app purchase API, I can't really do anything with it. This is programmable. So we've got a bunch of stuff coming that just hasn't even been done before. We just did something that works with the existing system, but there's no reason not to make new things. So there could be new token types, new business models. This is all programmable stuff.So it's a mistake to look at Ethereum and say, what it is today is what it's going to be. That's a huge mistake. You can do pretty much whatever you want. It's an imagination problem. And I think that's a lot of the reason why people discredit Web 3 is because one, they don't really know that much about it. Two, they don't consider the program ability of it, what you can change about it. They kind of just think about, ""Well, here's what I would do with my existing game. And here's how I would put it on it with the stuff that everybody else does."" And that's not right. That's not the right way to think about this at all. It's a lot more exciting than that.",1517
3,Gabriel Leydon - How Web3 Onboards a Billion Users,DigiDaigaku," Patrick: Can you tell the story then of Digi, how it was conceived, why they look the way they do, what they are, how many there are, get into some of the mechanics, the drops that you've done since? As much of the story, I think as possible would be fascinating to people. Gabriel: The first thing that we thought about when we made the Digi series was, I'm particularly obsessed with Japan and wanting to be number one in Japan. Japan is the best gaming market, period. They consume games like nobody else in the world. Everybody wants to be number one in Japan. It's very, very hard to do as outsiders, for sure. You definitely have to adopt their way to an extent, of how they play games, if you want to do well there. So that was number one. You would say, okay, anime is becoming a universal art style that is accepted everywhere. There's not that many art styles that actually scale worldwide. There's the American photorealistic style that we're all used to. There's the Nintendo anime- Patrick: Cartoony. Gabriel: ... cartoony look, that's been accepted everywhere. Chinese games, they tend to use a lot of Chinese history in their art. That's a big reason why it doesn't scale. So Genshin Impact is made in China. It's the biggest game, but it looks Japanese, and it's made in China. Korean games kind of have this Korean fantasy look to them too. They usually have trouble scaling out. And European games just look like American games pretty much. So you talk about if you want a billion people to play your game, there's really not that many looks that get a billion people excited. You're between in my opinion, kind of the Japanese art style and the American photorealism. So that's why we picked that. We're really going to focus on Japan. We did 2022 just because it matched the year, but it was more about being a small collection. We wanted it to be very, very small and exclusive. Not 10,000. Could just be a very, very small group of people because we wanted to really get those people excited about what we're doing at the company, and have them enjoy the ride along the way as we get to releasing games and stuff like that.Just have a smaller fan base, we wanted people that were more intimate type of thing, with just really hardcore fans of Limit Break. And then we of course, released it for free, which is not new. People have definitely done free before. We did it on purpose. They are very different than what's been done before, but we gave it away for free and they were really popular. As a result, we had an instant community built around us by doing that, instantly. And there could have been more efficient ways to build that community, definitely, but we're going to keep getting better and better at that over time. The people who got those for free are so excited about us, really excited. They look at everything we do. They want to be on the discord. Patrick: They propagate it. Gabriel: Yeah. And that's the point. It's like, why wouldn't you want an army of people making memes online all day, using your stuff as profile pictures, promoting the things that you do? Because look, the biggest problem in video games is that 99% of them fail, 99%. It's probably worse than that in free-to-play. It's probably like 99.9%. And the number one reason why they fail is because nobody knows about them. That's the number one reason why, nobody ever hears about them, they're not good at marketing, they don't have any money. It's not differentiated enough. And it could be a great game if you play it. You'd be like, ""Oh, I like this game,"" but it just never takes off. That's what happens to almost every game, literally 99% of games that have come out.So why wouldn't you want to take some of your in-game assets, give them away for free, rally, a community around a developer, have them waiting for whatever it is that you do, have the people who didn't get it for free asking for the next thing that's free? Because there's a ring of those people too, that are just like, ""I wish I would've got it. Will you do it again?"" Just get everybody excited about what you're doing. Frankly, that's the hardest part about making a game, is getting anybody to even care about what you're doing. And that's why free-to-own is going to destroy free-to-play. That's the real reason why, it's because people care because they have ownership of the things that you're putting out for free, about whether you're successful or not. Patrick: How do you think about the future of the supply demand balance? If everyone agrees that free-to-own is the future, why doesn't it just face the same problem of in a sea of free NFTs no one knows which ones are which? Gabriel: Absolutely. There's going to be tremendous competition, but in the meantime, free-to-play is dead. Patrick: Right. Gabriel: And I don't mind that. I'm like a wartime CEO. I don't mind going to war. And by the way, one, I'm very, very good at making money on free apps. I'm may be one of the best in the world at it. So I have no problem with that. Let's all compete on that. Two, there's not many people that are good at it. So as we push the market in that direction, yeah, there'll be a lot of people doing it, but there won't be that many people good at it because it's very, very hard. Three, the existing people that sold their land and made their $70 million now, that's an anchor around their neck. I'm sorry. That era, yeah, you made a lot of money, but that's not where we're going. Where we're going is a sea of free NFTs, with 3 billion people with active wallets because they got their NFTs for free, and some of them might be valuable to someone else.I don't see it as an issue. It's actually net positive. If everybody started giving everything away for free, what would happen to Ethereum would be insane. In my opinion, what's going to ultimately make Ethereum, is free NFTs. In my opinion, that is the core use case of Ethereum, is NFTs. It's the thing that can scale that everybody will end up having. Ethereum is that medium of exchange between all of those NFTs for everybody on Earth. So I don't see it as a currency or a DeFi platform or whatever. It's an NFT platform, and everyone's going to have one, and everyone's going to want one. And yeah, there'll be trillions of these things and most of them will be worthless, but what's the intrinsic value of an NFT anyways? Zero. The gas costs essentially. One, why would anybody turn it down? And two, there's going to be some that are very, very successful, that people are going to desire and want, despite the fact that there's trillions of them. Patrick: Can you talk about the creativity behind the extensions of the original Digi collection you've already rolled out, Spirit and some other things that sort of programmatically combine with the original assets? I think others have done small versions of this too. Port Apes did too. But talk through the creativity here and the purpose. Gabriel: The big thing is we're trying to connect to Web 2, between Web 2 and Web 3. We did this Adventure ERC-721 token, we call it. Essentially, it allows you to lock up, I'll say, your token, your NFT. And when you do that, you can secure it and then give your token, your NFT permissions to interact with another app. And that other app could be another NFT game, another Web 3 game, or another Web 2 game. And now you have the real beginnings of the metaverse.It's not that every NFT works in every game, meaning it's all rendered, like one gun works in the next game. No, no, no. It's about NFTs having permission to go into different worlds and then having that world set up an event for those people. The Digi people, they lock up their token and then another game has a Digi event. And the only way they can get into it is by giving that NFT permission to go into that event. That event gives them rewards, NFTs, whatever. The event ends and then the permission ends, and now they're back in the Digi world. So that's how I see it playing out, rather than just everything accepting everything. It'll be more about worlds connecting with each other and you could create much better experiences that way too, because it'll be a more customized experience than popping in and out of every app. Patrick: Say a bit about the tiering and the fun aspect of, I don't have a better word than breeding some of these NFTs to create new things, like the Royal Class versus some of the others. Gabriel: The Genesis NFTs, we call them Genesis because they create the world essentially. So we have this very small group of people who are generating the next set of NFTs, the Heroes. That's essentially how we've designed the system to work, is that these Genesis NFTs make the future NFTs. As we expand into other worlds and we make our universe bigger and bigger, those NFTs will be better over time, hopefully. So that's essentially the idea. And they still have a very hard talk about it. Future work is very, very hard to talk about because of the way the legal system here is in the United States. We want to have people collect those Genesis NFTs, and we want to make them special essentially. And that's the reason why they're making the Heroes and only them. We could have done another free mint, but we're not. Patrick: And is the idea that the holders of the Genesis characters could then control the destination of the things that are created from them, meaning they could sell them, they could- Gabriel: Yes. Patrick: So they're the propagators? Gabriel: Yes. Yeah. They're my advocates. And the more interesting things that we do together, the more they're going to advocate for what it is that we're doing.",2411
4,Gabriel Leydon - How Web3 Onboards a Billion Users,NFTs Ability to Change Marketing," Patrick: One of the things that jumps out of the conversation so far, you had talked about a year ago, seemingly jokingly, that coffee shops would be selling NFTs, and sure enough, that happened. Kind of crazy. It seems like there was an era, and I think MZ, Machine Zone was one of the most, if not the most sophisticated performance marketer back in the era of extreme targeting. That's changed. That's changed now. And it seems like NFTs are a chance to unlock brand marketing again, versus direct response performance marketing. Can you talk about that? Gabriel: Of course. You have these virtual items that cost you nothing to make, nothing, and they're tradable, they're limited in supply. You can save it forever or you can give it to a friend. You can put it on open sea. Why wouldn't you be handing these things out everywhere? Of course, you should be. It just makes sense. And that's why I say free-to-own. So when people say free-to-own like, ""Oh, that sounds like play-to-own."" Yeah. But play-to-own implies I have to play it. play-to-earn implies I have to play it to earn. Free-to-own is you're just here, it's free. Now you own it.People discredit how important the messaging is. The branding, the messaging, I'm really pushing it. And other gaming companies have already adopted it, which is amazing because it's obviously true. When they say my game is free-to-own, they get thousands of people saying, ""Give me a free NFT."" Isn't that what a game needs? Don't they need thousands of people paying attention to it, and hopefully millions? So to me, this is so obvious. Sometimes I wonder why I even have to talk about it because it's so obvious. I put it out there, it's like, 'Well I'm right and I won."" It's like a death blow. It's just like, ""Yeah, it's over. This is it. This is how it's going to be."" And it upsets a lot of the people who made hundreds of millions of dollars selling NFTs, because now it's like, ""Uh-oh, people are going to want them for free now. What do I do?"" It's like, ""Yeah, you can't just give them stickers anymore. You're going to have to work harder than that."" Patrick: Can't they update pretty quickly though? Gabriel: Technically they could. The console guys couldn't move over to free-to-play. They all got smoked, every single one of them. The skills that you need, you don't just decide that you're going to start doing this stuff. You're going to have to really try to figure it out. You can, you can figure it out, but most of them don't. Patrick: Do you think that the free-to-own NFT concept becomes a primary monetization method for other large brands. To make up an example, Kanye West. Gabriel: Yes. Patrick: Maybe he doesn't have an army of engineers. Gabriel: Everyone will need one. Patrick: Will that then become his method of fan monetization? Gabriel: It's going to be everybody's for everything. It's kind of like saying, do you think people are going to use coupons? Everyone is going to use NFTs, everybody. There's going to be trillions of these things. They're going to be everywhere. It's going to be so annoying because they're going to be everywhere. But as a result, you're going to move a lot of consumer spending from credit cards to ETH and it's going to be crazy. It's going to be something like nobody has ever seen before. That $20 limit everybody designs products around goes away. Things just change in a really big way. Ethereum is the real metaverse. It's the digital world blending in with the real world and these digital products unlocking things in the real world and vice versa. Yeah, everyone is going to use it. It's like the new email or something like that. The new mailer in your mail, the new countdown timer, the new signup for when this thing comes out, that's what it is. We already see car manufacturers use it, clothing company. Everybody uses it. It's going to go to everything. It's going to go to, like I said last year, your coffee shop, Seven-Eleven, whatever. Patrick: I was thinking recently about the interesting marketing strategy of what I would call the equivalent of a concept car that a Mercedes might invest god knows how much money to create some, not production, but incredibly cool thing to expand people's minds and to build their brand that is fundamentally an investment in the brand, not in selling the next S class or something. Talk about that more at large beyond gaming. Does this mean that the whole world's marketing spend is going to shift more from Facebook Ads to spectacles that expand people's brand impression in a sort of general but not specific way? Gabriel: You can move that spectacle into digital property now. You end up with these interlocking digital ecosystems where the entity forms access from one place to the next. And that's very, very powerful. And if you're not a digitally native designer, like business type person that thinks about virtual economies and how these things work, you're going to struggle. It's going to be really hard because it's not going to make sense to you. But I could see entirely new brands building extreme brand loyalty through these NFTs and getting everybody so excited that they want to go to the thing that replaces Starbucks. They prefer it because they're part of that community in a more meaningful way than just an email signup list or a push notification on a phone. Like I said last year, I don't think it happens overnight because there's not enough people that understand this stuff, how to even think this way. But if you're a young person, you're going to want to think about media, any kind of consumer good, experience service, and thinking about how do you integrate NFTs into those things and create a loyal community around your business or product. Patrick: This may be an overly specific question, but it seems as though so far every one of the really successful and enduring NFT projects is an actual person, character, or some sort of anthropomorphized ape or it's people-centric or character-centric. What's going on there? Even something like Loot, which was a flash in the pan, went away. Gabriel: It was free marketing on social media. People use those as PFPs. They called them PFPs. They didn't call them JPEGs. They called them Profile Picture Projects. You could have just said image project, but it was important that they were called Profile Picture Projects because you would buy them and you would make it part of your profile. Then other people would see it and say, ""Oh, I want one of those, but there's only 10,000 of them."" Essentially calling them PFPs was the thing that made them big. Otherwise, they would just be drawings. That was important for NFT 1.0, that was the marketing. NFT 2.0 was join our club. It was like a PFP plus a club. It's not just a PFP. It's also a little bit more. We'll send you a pack of stickers or something like that. And then the third one is a more interoperable, virtual experience, which is where we're going through gaming and through crossover gaming and all kinds of different things that we could do with these things. But it's a more software-driven, modern approach to Web 3.0. Patrick: Do you think we'll see success away from characters? When we studied Magic, I think the most expensive Magic card was a black Lotus or something. It wasn't a character. It was an item. Gabriel: There's been a few. There's been a few keys, they function as keys, that have been successful, very successful. Like Proof Collective keys, they sell for like 50 ETH or something like that. And those are membership NFTs. Those have already worked several times. Not as frequently as PFP projects have worked. Memberships have worked already and several times, so they'll continue to work. And then for items, the reason why you don't see the black lotus is because there's just not a big Web 3.0 game yet. Just why? There are Mystic Axies in Axie Infinity that have sold for nearly a million dollars. We've seen some of that. And an Axie isn't really like a PFP-style drawing, I guess, image. It looks like a character and that's worked. My rule of thumb is if it's worked twice, it's going to work three times. If it's worked once, it'll probably work twice. If something has worked 100 times and you don't get it by then, you're just never going to get it probably. And then someone else is going to make a billion dollars. And you're going to say, ""Why wasn't that me?"" You're going to say, ""How come I didn't do that?"" Patrick: One of the most intriguing things to me watching this and of having the benefit of a combination of the inside of the outside view is watching your Twitter strategy. On a relative basis per follower, you've got a crazy amount of fervor happening around you. I'm just curious to hear what your thoughts on it. Why have you created such a fervor? And how much of it is intentional and strategic versus just kind of messing around? Gabriel: We announced Limit Break two months ago and nobody really paid attention. And we kind of purposely did it that way. We didn't make a big deal out of it. We didn't do any press. We just said, ""We got these investors."" Just left it at that. Nobody really paid attention to it. Then we did this Venture Beat article where we announced that we raised 200 million, which is a lot of money. And I knew we were going to get a lot of attention that day. I decided to spend it on going after paid MITs essentially and say, ""Okay. Well, I'm going to have everybody's attention today for today only."" And I probably didn't do it in the most artful way, but it definitely worked. But I said, ""All right, I'm going to end paid MITs today. That's what I'm going to do. I'm going to try to level set the industry in my favor, which is free, something I know how to do."" I don't have a big fan base like these other guys do already, and they'll still be able to. They'll be able to put out another MIT and make another $50 million, $100 million. They'll be able to do that for a while, but not forever. Honestly, I think a lot of people were cold water, basically. It's like somebody raises 200 million and you kind of expect them to say, ""Come work for us. We're really cool."" And I said, ""No, this is over."" I couldn't have predicted a response I would've got, but the reality was I was right. I learned a hard lesson is that NFTs haven't been doing well lately. They don't exactly want somebody new coming in saying, ""This old way is over."" They want their old NFTs to do well. That's not a very popular message if you're holding some stuff that you wish would do better.But over the weeks, like I said, I've already seen a dozen companies adopt strategy. And I've had lots of people privately message me and say, ""I wish we'd get into the paid MIT. I wish we would've done it for free. It's better."" I know I'm right. And I know it's right. And I know it's inevitable. So I just leave it alone now. I kind of push it, but I won't push it too hard. I had one day to change things. That's how I saw it. I had one day to do it where everyone was going to see what I was talking about. $200 million is such a large number. Everybody is going to say, ""What the hell is going on?"" And ultimately, like I said before, this is how we get three billion people on Ethereum. I want the 60,000 people that own NFTs that are using Ethereum every day to own my NFT. That would be great, but that's not where we're going. That's not where we raise the money that we raise. That's not why we're building what we're building. We want hundreds of millions of people, not tens of thousands. And if we achieve that, we'll be the biggest gaming company on Earth by far. We won't even be close. To me as someone who's been doing this for 20 years, I know I'm right and I know it's obvious and I know I'm going to have a lot of competition, a lot because they're going to see it work. I already know there's several companies just getting ready to just try to eat us alive. I already know that's happening. Patrick: Is that why the 200 million? Is functionally that effectively a defensive raise? Gabriel: No. It's opportunistic because the LTVs of a crypto player are so insane in comparison to Web 2.0. Look at it. Okay. A few thousand people are willing to spend 50 million in a day on a land sale. That does not happen in Web 2.0. That is impossible actually, literally impossible on Web 2.0. There's no way to do it. It would never work. Even what Kevin Rose did with moon birds. He had 10,000 moon birds that he sold for $7,000 apiece. Oh, what? First of all, in a game, that's impossible. Let's keep that in mind. You actually can't even do that in a game. There is no gaming platform on Earth where you could do that. You can't do it on console. You can't do it in mobile. You can't even do it on PC with Stripe. They're not going to let all those purchases through. You're going to get chargebacks. There's going to be a... So you literally can't even do it.You have an art collection membership thing that they're doing at Proof at 7,000 apiece. If you're a business, that's pretty cool. You're making a business and you're looking at that. It's like, geez, that's amazing. So the old trad fintech stuff is kind of irrelevant in comparison. Why would I ever even want to make something on credit cards if I could work on E? I'm pretty influenced by Mark Pincus. We were very young kids competing against him in 2008, 2007. In the early Facebook days, he was the only one who took it seriously. And he would go out and say, ""I'm going to raise more money than anybody. I'm going to do more marketing than anyone because this is going to be huge."" And the people who we were competing with were kids like us. And we were just three of us in a room. And it was kind of like, what? It was almost like Zynga is going to win, guaranteed going to win. That's how it felt.That's why we made an iPhone game. Zynga was so dominant already that we were like, ""Well, they're not on iPhone so let's go do mobile games."" Because we started on MySpace and we thought about going to Facebook and we just thought it was pointless because Zynga is going to win. And they were right actually. Everybody could always do better execution when you look backwards, but they were right. He was right. And I was wrong. I was the kid who was scared. I was the kid who was wondering if it was real or not. And he had the bravery to say, ""No, this is real. And I'm going to raise more money and I'm going to spend more money on marketing. And this is going to be huge."" I learned that lesson. And now I'm 42. And I look at this and I say this is the exact same thing all over again. Except this time around, I'm not going to be the scared kid who thinks like, well, maybe I'll make a few million. Patrick: Or be the warlord this time. Gabriel: Yeah. I'm not going to be the scared kid that says, ""Oh, maybe I'll make a few million dollars and that'll be great."" No, this is a real thing. This is big. And we raised a lot of money, but I want to raise billions. I don't want to stop here. I want to keep going because it's obvious what's going to happen next. It's obvious. We've got to execute and make it real. Now it's your question of hiring the right people, figuring out the right marketing plans, building a great game, and scaling. Patrick: What do you think will define the legendary marketers of the next 10 years? Gabriel: Knowing how to get hundreds of thousands of people excited about your digital products. Digital products branding is, ""This is cool. Kim Kardashian wears it."" Versus, ""Here's a piece of our business, our world, our virtual world. You own it now. We're going to go do this next. We're going to do that next."" And then all those people are on your team. Patrick: It seems hard to me. It's probably just lack of imagination, but in your context, building a digital world and a literal game that is fun to play makes a ton of sense. If something entitles me to enjoy myself more and for longer or in a different way, I get it. Where I struggle is the coffee shop, is the crossover from something digital, the NFT to something real world. Do you think that it will be as powerful in that context? Gabriel: Depends on how interoperable they are. If you say, ""This is my cafe, and here's a membership,"" I think that can work. Patrick: Here's a back room that's cooler where you can hang out and you sign in with your NFT. Gabriel: Discount or we save your order for you or a ton of different things. Or you get to vote on what our menu is next week or whatever. Not necessarily those are good ideas, but there could be a million of them. It's not so simple. I think that will scale. It will scale and it will work to an extent. But I think that if these things can blend with other virtual worlds, the cafe does an event with the barbecue place, members get something special over there that week, and you have these networks of interlocking businesses doing cross promotion with each other, managing these virtual spaces and how they connect with the real world, then you have something very, very powerful. That's more of game-like thinking than it is somebody who runs a cafe. That's a good startup. You're going to want to share communities. You don't just want to dominate and own one. You want to share, you want to partner, and you want to make membership, if it's just membership, exciting. Patrick: Do you think we'll see more token-mediated media experiences? Gabriel: Everything, absolutely. Token gaming. Patrick: You have to own these two podcast NFTs. If you own both, it unlocks this collab between the two of them or something. Gabriel: Any kind of business scheme that you can come up with would probably work if it's cool, and that's actually the hard part, it's like making it cool. I think if you make it really cold and it's just X plus Y, it becomes too much of a math calculation. You're just doing ROI calculations. It can't be so simple. Actually, If it gets to the point where the ROI becomes the thing that everyone's thinking about, you're screwed. It has to be more about the experience and what you're doing and how it's changing all the time. That's what it has to be about. Patrick: Capture some imagination and some emotion. Gabriel: I saved $2. It cannot just be that. Take it a step further.",4623
5,Gabriel Leydon - How Web3 Onboards a Billion Users,"AI, Innovation, & The Future"," Patrick: It's exciting that some emotive responses, some imagination will fuel the most successful of these projects. And it brings to mind something you and I were texting about the other day, which is the insane surge in these AI models being open source, Stable Diffusion being the one that I thinks really caught the public imagination. Say a bit about your impression of watching these technologies proliferate alongside what you're doing. These things are crazy powerful. They feel like magic. Gabriel: Creative people are really scared. So they look at these things and they say... the knee jerk reaction you often see is like, ""Well, they're not as good as if a person did,"" but only saying that because it's close. If it was terrible, they wouldn't say anything. So they get very defensive. For somebody like me, it's great because I can't draw. There's all these really cool Stable Diffusion extensions. I saw one in Photoshop where you just draw a stick figure and it'll turn it into like amazing drawing. You just draw a stick figure and you type in what you want it to be, and it'll look really good. That's great for me because I can't get the pictures in my head out. I can't get them out of my head with my hands.It's going to change communication. I think it's more of a translation tool than it is an image tool. We use words and letters and characters, written language as hacks because we can't tell you what's in our head. So we've got to translate images in our head to words and then turn those words into an image in your mind, which is very, very hard to do. That's why we have writers because it's hard to do and only a few people can actually do that, can turn words into an image. Stable Diffusion is like the ultimate writer, it's the ultimate author. It turns words into images that everybody can understand. I don't need to speak a specific language to understand it. Language is almost like a... it's like a mistake. It's like a temporary thing that gets replaced by machines that can make images, and the images will be much more efficient at communicating what we're thinking.So when I see it with Stable Diffusion, I say, ""Okay, here we go. We're finally going to be able to turn words into images and have real communication now."" I almost want to replace or modify what you see with these AR glasses with Google Translate. You go there and you're in Japan and someone's speaking Japanese and you see the English words. I would almost want to pair it with Stable Diffusion and have a picture that goes along with it. Somebody says, ""turn right,"" I can have an arrow or something. I can have a visual that makes more sense than maybe what a bad translation says. Patrick: Is the ultimate proof point of all this the fact that memes do such a better job of communicating certain ideas than words? Gabriel: Pictures say a thousand words, right? That's true because they're better than words. It'll have big, big impacts on art and gaming. It's really exciting for gaming. The next step is animations and 3D models, which is already happening and that's going to have a big impact. And at the end of the day, if everybody can make art and everybody can make games, like marketing and awareness is, once again, going to be the biggest problem that everybody has, as everybody can draw now and everybody can write now and everybody can do all those things. Patrick: Maybe just go there even deeper on distribution, I kind of ask what will define great marketers? And you said understanding of NFTs, but assuming everyone understands NFTs- Gabriel: What's after that? Patrick: What's after that? What is great distribution? That's way too broad a question maybe, but. Gabriel: Great distribution is aligning the community with the product with the same incentives. That's what great distribution is. That's what NFTs do. Instead of drink Coke because it makes you dance really cool on a bus or whatever, it's like drink Coke because you own a Coke NFT. That is way, way, way more powerful. That's what I see. I see aligning incentives across capitalism and the consumer. That's what I think NFTs can do and it's going to take a lot of creativity to do it. I don't have all the answers for everybody, but I do see it in games fairly clearly. I think everybody does. In games, it's pretty obvious. It's just that we haven't seen a big game besides Axie. So there's a lot of people waiting. But there's enough there from my free to play background where I can look at and say, ""Oh, man, this is obvious that this is definitely going to work."" Patrick: I think it's fair to say last time we talked a year ago, you had a fairly grim view on the general state of innovation. Gabriel: I still do. Patrick: It seems like on the digital side at least, it's unbelievably exciting. Gabriel: I was thinking about how come we don't have new bleach. If you look at your household items, it's the same stuff that people were buying like 50 years ago. And those are the most important things. Those are the things you use every day. They don't get any better. Nothing changes really. It's just all in the digital world because it's all imaginary. That's why. It's a great environment to just make stuff up. You can make it real, like NFTs kind of make your imagination real in a lot of ways, but that's what's so powerful about it. It makes the digital world real to an extent. That's why they're so powerful. That's why they matter so much. But if you go back to 2019, do you really feel like you're living in a much more advanced world or less? Patrick: Again, image communicating a thousand words. I live in Greenwich, suburb of New York City, and the Metro North is the train connector between the two that everyone takes that commutes to the city. And if you look at the old train schedules from 1995, from the early 1920s, the train now takes longer to get to New York than it did in 1995 by four or five minutes, and it's basically the same as it was a hundred years ago. My friend and I, Bill, always joke about this. I was just like, ""Can you believe that this is the case? This is insanity."" Gabriel: I said this last time, I'll say it again. The digital world advancing faster than everything else is a very bad sign. It's not good. And this is me as a game guy, but you can't have all of the innovation going into digital worlds. We live in the real world. We don't live in the digital world. We can't just keep making the digital world the thing. It's not going to work. It's not going to work, but it makes sense because there's scale there. You can make money worldwide instantly, and it's very obvious why everything's getting pushed into the digital world. But it's dangerous, everything getting pushed there. It's very dangerous. Patrick: I agree with you that it doesn't seem, versus 2019 or 2015 or whatever, that really much has gotten fundamentally better. But I am definitely an optimist. Seeing things like Boom's Supersonic or Clover building, new building technologies. Gabriel: That's sort of bringing us back to the eighties though. Patrick: Like a quieter version of the eighties. Gabriel: Which is a big deal. The fact that it's quieter is a big deal. Patrick: I continue to hope and believe that we will retest some of these things. Gabriel: But why when you can make an NFT? You see the problem? That's why I always say about going to Mars. No one is going to Mars. We're going to VR Mars because we won't know the difference anyways. You see my point? If VR gets so good that you don't know that you're not on Mars, then why do you need to go to Mars? Patrick: When we talked last time, we were sort of at near peak optimism about Web3 and crypto, and now we're not maybe at peak pessimism, but- Gabriel: I'm not pessimistic about Web3. Everything's going into the virtual world. Web3's going to be the most important thing there is because of that. But I'm not saying that's necessarily a great thing. It's still true. It's still going to happen. Patrick: I think you'd mentioned that there are two other games. Maybe you were even investor in them or at least respected what they're doing. What do you most admire in some of the adjacent stuff that's getting built in your world? Castaway is one, I think they use those as an example. Gabriel: Oh, yeah, Dayton. Dayton is, he's one of these Gen-Z kid. He just works so hard. It's really cool to interact with him. He's determined. It's becoming more and more uncommon, in my opinion. But what's great about him is how much he's been pivoting. He just pivots relentlessly to find the thing that works. He saw what we were doing free. He did it for free and it worked for him too. So he's just pivoted everything into that model now. You got to have that desire to win, to kind of abandon what you're doing to change. You should be willing to work on something for six months and then just throw it away in one day and do the new thing. A lot of people aren't willing to do that, and he is, so it's cool. He's a lot younger than me. He reminds me a lot of myself when I was his age, and he's going through a lot of the same problems I went through. So it's cool to see that. Patrick: What do you think are interesting options for game mechanics that get released by Web3 technology that weren't possible on Web2? You're building a Web2 game, I know. Gabriel: What we just released with the Adventure Token is huge. It allows you to do a permission crossover event between games essentially. So if you wanted to be featured in a game right now, you would have to go to the company. This is very common in Japan. In Japan, they have these crossover events. They do it better than anybody else in the world and it's like a real business over there. They have agencies actually that manage brands coming into games for the companies. They set up the calendars. They say, ""Well, Spiderman's going to come in this month and da da da, next month."" It's run through this agency. The gaming companies get the calendar and then they start making content ahead of time, and they plan stuff out like a year in advance essentially.In the new world, we have smart contracts where I can ping a company and say, ""Hey, here's my assets. Connect to this smart contract, and those assets will come into your game."" So now you have a much more fluid world. Instead of an agency driven marketing thing, you can have IP holders giving access to different IP programmatically through these smart contracts. They can guarantee that they have access to it and they can build really cool virtual experiences around that in a way that they couldn't do before. Right now at games, you have two games. They're both virtual worlds. Interacting between the two of those right now is done through phone calls and emails and meetings. That can move over to a smart contract world, and that'll create a lot more interesting interaction between virtual worlds that were not possible before Web3. That's just scratching the service, in my opinion, but that alone is non-trivial. That's actually a really big deal. Patrick: To go from 60,000 to hundreds of millions or billions of people, I'm curious what you think needs to happen on the rest of the infrastructure side, specifically, how these people get their ETH to begin with and where they keep it? Gabriel: They won't get ETH first. They'll get NFT first. Patrick: They'll need a wallet still? Gabriel: They're going to need a wallet still, but they're not going to get ETH first. They're going to get an NFT first and that NFT could turn into ETH. That's where they're actually going to get their first ETH from. Patrick: Oh, fascinating. Gabriel: From the NFT. Patrick: All right. That's very interesting. Yeah, reverse the order. Gabriel: Yeah, reverse the order. The NFT has no value. It costs zero to make. ETH has value, but I can still turn that NFT into ETH, if it's managed properly. Does that make sense? So the world's going to get its first ETH from an NFT. Patrick: And they're going to get the NFT for free. So wallet seems like the key technology then? Gabriel: Yeah, wallet. And the thing that's holding everything back is mobile wallets. It's Apple's wallet, it's Google Pay wallet. Once Ethereum gets integrated into that wallet, it's over. Instant adoption worldwide. That's the real gate right now. But, remember, people are really into these games. They're very, very into these games and they're willing to spend a lot of money on free-to-play games. I don't think it's going to be that big of a jump to convert players, not the world, but players from free-to-play to Web3. That's the real target audience to move over. Everybody else is a lot harder because you got the wallets and stuff. But, remember, these people are willing to play games for four hours a day, that all their friends are on it. They want to have all the items inside the game. You already have all the motivation there to get them to move over to Web3. It's all there. Patrick: I think it's a fascinating place to close our discussion that onboarding is the inverse, I think, of what many have expected, that you were waiting for everyone to get some ETHs so they can buy some stuff, when in fact they're just going to get some stuff and then maybe that'll turn into ETH is a fascinating closing thought. I've been so fascinated watching you build this business and have learned so much in the year since our first discussion talking to you. Really appreciate your time today and everything you've taught me. Gabriel: Thank you. I appreciate too.This site uses cookies to improve your browsing experience.

6,Harley Finkelstein - Building the Entrepreneurship Company,Introduction," Patrick: My guest today is Harley Finkelstein. Harley is the president of Shopify and has been with the company since its early years. He's a lawyer by training, but an entrepreneur by calling, and that is the focus of our discussion. We discussed the different dimensions of entrepreneurship and Shopify's role in promoting it, as well as exploring the company's transition to public markets, and what the last few years have been like. Please enjoy my discussion with Harley Finkelstein.",110
7,Harley Finkelstein - Building the Entrepreneurship Company,Finding Your Life's Work," Patrick: So Harley, maybe the place to begin is with a term that I and my team have spent a lot of time thinking about and trying to define, which is this notion of life's work amongst entrepreneurs. Obviously, you can be doing your life's work outside of a business, and there's lots of people that do with great outcomes, but our specific interest is what does it mean for an entrepreneur to be doing their life's work? Is it something that's there at the beginning? Is it something that's developed after the fact when they come to realize that they're enjoying their work? Trying to really define this concept, which I think can be an unbelievable fuel for a durable enduring business franchise is of great interest to me. Given that you've been doing what you've been doing at Shopify with Tobi for so long and I think are doing your life's work or would say you are, I'd love to hear your interpretation of this term, whether or not you think it's as powerful as I do, and if so, what the definition or dimensions of it are to you. Harley: Even the fact that you and I, Patrick, are talking about this idea of life's work I think is incredibly interesting. My father was an immigrant and came to Canada when he was like five years old. His parents were holocaust survivors. They left Hungary during the Hungarian revolution and come to Canada to basically escape persecution. There was no conversations around the dinner table, my father was young with his parents, talking about life's work or how do you find your great passion and how do you create great value for the world. In those days or at least the way my father would say it is it was entirely about survival. That was it. The luxury of finding something that if you were to borrow the term Ikigai, which is a Japanese concept, which is like life's work, it's a reason for being. It's something that gives you a sense of purpose, a sense of meaning, but also a living, meaning someone will pay you for it. We are incredibly lucky that we can even think about that. The reason I think it's really important is because for past generations, they effectively did a job they didn't love to eventually stop working if they were able to retire to go do their life's work, and they were able to pick up all these clues throughout 20 or 30 or 50 years of work providing with an indication that, ""Maybe my life's work is in this direction.""I think I'm fortunate enough to be doing my life's work. As you and I talked about previously, I think you're also doing your life's work, which is something you love doing, something that is of value to the world, and something that people will pay you for. What's great about finding your life's work early on in your career or in your life is that you get a lot longer of a period of time in which to perfect it. You're never going to reach perfection. I'm never going to be the world's greatest storyteller, and you may not ever be the greatest investor in the world, but the pursuit of getting there, the journey of getting there in itself is going to be incredibly rewarding and hopefully will create real value. I think for entrepreneur, it is even more important for them to find their life's work or to feel like they're doing their life's work because the practice of entrepreneurship is daunting.There are now millions of stores on Shopify. Every minute or so, a brand new entrepreneur gets their first sale on Shopify, 10% of all eCommerce in the US now, which is amazing, but entrepreneurship is not easy and most small businesses are unequivocally going to fail. What that means is if you don't have this deep desire to do it, ultimately, one of those bad emails you're going to get or one of those setbacks you're going to get or one of those issues that are going to come your way may be the cause of you stopping. However, if you feel like, hey, you are in pursuit of this deep desire to build something, to deliver something, to create something, that I think is one of the best ways for you to persevere, and two years past the start of that pandemic, and whether you call it the end or not, I think what got a lot of entrepreneurs and small businesses through the pandemic, in some cases, allowed them to thrive in a way that big companies did not is because they had a deep desire and passion for what they were doing. Patrick: One of the things that really animates me is people who are distinctive, wacky, different, clearly not similar to other people that I've met, something just totally unique about them, often these two categories intersect or overlap, where because they're doing something they care so deeply about, they don't really give a crap whether or not they're doing it in a conventional way or they appear in a conventional way or they communicate in a conventional way. You have this great idea of a river stone, the average polished executive. I'd love you to tell that story of the river stone and what you've learned about that and being distinctive and how that relates to potentially big outcomes versus being well-rounded and good at a lot of things. Harley: One of the cool parts of leading a large company is that I get to meet a lot of other people leading large companies. First of all, there were big differences between founder-led companies that are at scale and non-founder-led companies. It's not that one is better, one is worse, it's just the culture is absolutely unequivocally different. Tobi started the company and still is the CEO of the company. He's at the helm. So we are definitely a founder-led company. What I've noticed, however, the founder versus non-founder-led companies, most large companies, when a leader comes in and that leader has a particular skill or a better way to put it, a particular edge in one category, one area of the business, over time, that leader and those leaders end up becoming fairly well-rounded leaders. You put a sharp stone in a riverbed over many, many thousands of years, it'll become a well-rounded beautiful river stone. It'll be smooth and it'll be round in all sides. There won't be any spikes.That is not how we think about leaders growing at Shopify. What we really try to do instead is find people who have these spikes, these edges, and allow them to sharpen those edges even further. The caveat to this whole thing is they have to have enough self-awareness and they have to have enough capacity to realize that, ""Hey, I'm really good at this thing and I think there's a chance that I could be world class at it, but these other things I'm just not that good at,"" and then to put up their hand proverbially or literally and say, ""I need help on these things because this is not where I'm going to excel."" So at Shopify, we want our leaders, and I think if you look at Tobi and I in particular, we've tried to do that, sharpen our edges so we can be really, really great and eventually potentially even world class, but mitigate our weaknesses by hiring people that are better, smarter, faster than we are at those sort of things also.I think that actually provides for a much more enjoyable pursuit of life's work. I've been at Shopify now for a third of my life, and I think that's really quite unique. I mean, I'm 38. A third of my life is a long time relative to how many years I've been on the planet, but I think the reason that it is unique is because it has created an environment where people can come, they can bring their potential life's work with them, their potential life's work pursuit, and they can get really, really good at it in a way that at other companies they would get good at it, but they'd also get other things at the cost of that particular spike getting dulled over time. Patrick: One of my friends, Graham Duncan, has this amazing essay where he talks about someone that may be building a new investment platform. His business was backing other investors. There's just really simple idea in there, which is figure out what your compulsion is, the thing you literally cannot help but do all the time, and figure out a way to put that at the center of your platform or of your job or of your role or whatever. I think it's the same concept of spikiness. Forget exceptionalism. You can get more and more exceptional over time, but even deeper than that, it's like what are you compulsive about? What can you not stop doing almost no matter what beyond your control? If you had to apply that to yourself, what is that compulsion? What is the thing you can't help but do? Harley: There's a couple terms that I use. One is the ground state. What is your ground state? A silly way to think about is, what do you think about in the shower in the morning? You're not checking your phone, and you're about as present as you possibly can because there's really nothing else to distract you in the shower. What are you thinking about? I'm really lucky because the thing that I've been thinking about for most of my life in the shower is a thing that I get to do every day at Shopify. When I was a kid, I'm Jewish, so when you're 13 years old and you're Jewish, you go to a lot of these bar mitzvahs, bat mitzvahs for girls. One of the things that is fairly common at these bar mitzvahs is that there's a DJ there. I became somewhat, not obsessed, but certainly really interested by these DJs I was encountering basically every weekend for a year period during that bar mitzvah period, first in Montreal where I lived, where I grew up, and then I moved to South Florida, so then in South Florida. The reason I thought the DJs were so compelling was not because of the music. I still DJ because I like to DJ, but I wasn't really into the music itself. I just loved the idea that there was this combination of words and sounds. There was a formula that they used to take the entire group of people that were sitting down at tables eating rubber chicken, and within three minutes, there was like a mosh pit on the dance floor or there was a Congo line happening. That idea of they can do things, it's almost like writing code. With these three or four steps, I can actually change the entire energy of a room of three or four hundred people. So I really want to be a DJ. I was 13. No one would hire me.So my dad, he's an entrepreneur, he never was very successful at it, but he was always entrepreneurial, encouraged me to start my own DJ company. I started my own DJ company, hired myself, ended up DJing 500 bar and bat mitzvahs, which was really quite fun. Actually, just a total aside, but one of the things my dad did because he couldn't give me money to start these silly businesses with all throughout my adolescence was he would make me a business card for pretty much every single silly business I had, which in hindsight was his way of saying, ""You can do this."" He couldn't give me $1,000 or $5,000 to start because he didn't have the money, but he was basically endorsing that all these crazy ideas may lead to something. I tell that story not because DJing was that important to me in my life. The problem that I had was I wanted to DJ, no one hired me. So I used this tool in my toolbelt called entrepreneurship, and that entrepreneurship tool allowed me to start my DJ company. Years later, I ended up moving back to Canada from South Florida to go to McGill for undergrad. My parents went through a really tough time. My father was not around anymore. My parents had no money. One thing, and I pulled out this tool out of my toolbelt called entrepreneurship and I started selling T-shirts to universities all across Canada. The problem was whatever it was, but the solution was use this tool called entrepreneurship. In 2005, I met Tobi I moved to Ottawa because a mentor of mine was teaching law here and I wanted to go to law school, become a better entrepreneur. That was his advice. Met Tobi, and Tobi had just written this piece of software to sell a snowboard, a Snow Devil. Very quickly realized that other people may want to use the software to sell their own products.I became one of the first merchants on Shopify. I started selling T-shirts. Law school didn't allow me to run the business the way I did in undergrad because you actually have to show up to class. You didn't have to do that undergrad, but again, I needed to make money and I had to be in class. Attendance mattered in law school. I started this T-shirt shop on Shopify and I was able to support myself. These three stories in themselves are unique and interesting. The main thing for me was that entrepreneurship was a way to solve problems in my entire life. The reason I became so obsessed with what Shopify was doing, what Tobi was doing was because it felt like he was making something that was previously not possible possible. My ground state has always been, how can we actually make people's lives better through entrepreneurship? What are people's unique individual ideas of success are? Is it putting food on the table? Is it to make a billion dollars? Is it to change an industry? Is it to go to space? Whatever those things might be, one of the common solves of those things is to use an entrepreneurial vehicle in which to do so. The fact that every minute a new entrepreneur gets the first sale on Shopify, it means that my Venn diagram of my personal interest, which is this obsession that entrepreneurship is this great tool and the fact that Shopify makes that tool even better and more accessible, the Venn diagram entirely overlaps.",3006
8,Harley Finkelstein - Building the Entrepreneurship Company,The Entrepreneurial Formula," Patrick: If you think about your just hands-on experience, especially with the T-shirts and the DJing, two very mentally approachable concepts for anyone that's listening, how would you boil things down to the most simple version of the entrepreneurial formula? What are the variables in the entrepreneurial formula as you see it from both sides now having enabled so many but also been one at a smaller scale when you were young? Harley: I read a really interesting book recently. It's called Distilled. It's by Charles Bronfman, and Charles Bronfman was famously the son of Sam Bronfman who created Seagrams, certainly one of the most important entrepreneurs in Canadian history, but also one of the best entrepreneurs on the planet, to ever walk the planet I should say. He talks a lot about that. Once the Seagrams empire got started, because they had so much more capital than everybody else, there was this flywheel effect. The main ingredient to starting businesses was capital, was resources. So the more capital you had, the more money you can spend. Frankly, even in the early days of eCommerce, certainly for my online store that I started on Shopify in 2006, it was a matter of who can outspend each other on AdWords. The more money you had spent on AdWords, the more money you were able to make, more money you're able to reinvest into AdWords. One of the things that I think has been unique to a lot of entrepreneurs, and certainly to my situation, was I didn't have much money. I didn't have any resources. I couldn't rely on necessarily doing things. I couldn't outmarket. So in the T-shirt business, we made T-shirt for universities. One of the largest incumbents in that space was a company called Russell Athletics, which is still around today. Russell Athletics just had this machine of sales reps that went from university to university. They had a division for the collegiate promotional product business.I forgot what's called, but the parent company was Russell. They had this machine that would go from college to college and effectively would sell everybody else. I couldn't do that. What I could do, however, was I was the same age as the end consumer of those T-shirts. I was a college student making T-shirts for other college students. Because of that, my unfair advantage was that when I'd go in to present to them, ""Hey, you should buy my T-shirts,"" I would create these little mini fashion shows in the actual student council office with students that went to the school because I was a Canadian student, I had friends that were students at pretty much every major Canadian university. I was able to do things that Russell Athletics couldn't do or didn't even think about doing. Because I was a one-man operation, I didn't have to make much money. If I was able to make a little bit margin, if I was able to make 5% gross margin, I had no overhead, so my gross margin and my net margin was effectively the same. It was cost of good sold. I was trying to do things that wouldn't necessarily be available to the larger companies with more capital.To relate it back to eCommerce today, if you look at some of the most successful eCommerce brands today, many of them also didn't start with money. They didn't necessarily stuff a bunch of money into AdWords. What they did was they found tactics and tools in which to scale their business where the larger companies just didn't care enough to do so or didn't think about any. We talked about Ben Francis and Gymshark earlier. 2013, this guy from London in his dorm room while he's selling pizzas starts Gymshark, and he just sends a bunch of T-shirts out to personal trainers for free and says, ""If you like them, wear them,"" and that was really the introduction of influencer marketing globally on the internet, not to say that Ben made that happen, but he certainly was one of the pioneers of it. That's not what Nike was doing. Nike was buying big Superbowl ads. The common thread about my entrepreneurial ventures wasn't necessarily that I had an unfair advantage, in fact just the opposite because I didn't have an unfair advantage. I searched for one and it tended to be something random like the fact that I didn't have overhead and I was a college student selling to other college students. Patrick: You had sent me this really interesting article that's probably a bit stale now about this notion of the 2010s being a lost decade of at least American entrepreneurship. Really a sad set of stats around new business formation. The advantages of scale and scope that you referenced in your last answer, everyone's familiar with. You hear an idea in the commerce space and you might think, ""Well, why can't Amazon just do this?"" or ""Why can't one of the big incumbents with scale and scope just do this? What's unique about it?"" It seems like even though the tooling is amazing for entrepreneurs, the scale and scope thing that you battled Russell on, that writ large is quite intimidating if you're a new entrepreneur. Maybe just talk a little bit about the data that you've seen and the lessons you've gleaned from a long time now enabling these entrepreneurs. What is harder and what is easier than when you were starting your DJ business or something like that? Really interested to understand the major trends that are for and against new business formation. Harley: I think the thing that keeps improving is that the cost of failure continues to trend as close to zero as possible. It's never going to be zero because there's always going to be the opportunity cost of your time, what else you can be doing? What you forego by focusing on one thing not the other, but generally, the cost of failure is getting lower and lower. That's the first thing. You're right, there was this lost decade of entrepreneurship. That was sad. I mean, the article I think I sent you, I think it was written three or four years ago and it was the last 10 years. Entrepreneurship hit a bit of a lull, and there wasn't a lot of new business creation, there was. It wasn't growing at the rate that it had previously grown. Couple things, by the way, just to sprinkle some good news on this. That has changed fairly dramatically in the last couple of years. If you just look at stats from 2021, which I think probably will go down as one of the golden era years of entrepreneurship, in 2021, there were more than 5.4 million new business applications filed in the US. That is the most since 2004. That is almost two times the 15-year average, which is about 2.8 million per year. That is dramatic.You can also just look in terms of zeitgeist, cultural zeitgeist. In 2021, Google puts out their year end search. Searches for how to start a business surpassed those for how to get a job in 2021. That had not been the case previously. Then you'd go even one step deeper. Wharton, which is obviously iconic business school, in the last five years, the amount of Wharton MBAs, awarded business students, who chose to concentrate on entrepreneurship increased by more than 30%. Business registrations, the zeitgeist in terms of searching and discovery and doing research on starting a business, even in academia you are seeing people far more inclined to look for this entrepreneurial education or background, and we can talk about whether or not you can teach entrepreneurship or not. It's a whole different story, but I'm a lot more hopeful. Part of what is happening, as I mentioned, is that the cost of failure is getting closer to zero. Part of what I think is also happening is that the tools that are available, whether it's Shopify or any of the other, they're just getting really, really good. Shopify was really built to sell snowboards, and now we are powering some of the largest companies on the planet. I mean, look at Mattel, for example, or Spanks, for example, or Allbirds, for example, or FIGS. These are companies that are leaders in their categories and the entire business runs on Shopify, which is neat.The other point I think that is different is this idea of a hobby. I've said this before on Twitter and I think I've been criticized because I made a comment, more people should commercialize their hobby. Some people should leave their hobby their hobby, and I'm not saying everyone should commercialize their hobby, but there are people who have jobs that they really, really don't like, they're dismayed by office life, and they come home, they go to their workshop or they go to their desk or they go to the garage or wherever they go, and they tinker and they build. That is where they are their happiness. Some of those people should think about commercializing that hobby. Maybe that is what their life's work is. In fact, it very possibly might be. If they love doing something, they love making beautiful teacups like I'm drinking right now, maybe other people want to buy their teacups. If you get to commercialize your hobby means, one, you get to spend more time on it. You get to do it longer. You get to drive joy from it, and you get to make a living by doing it as well. I think that in itself is really interesting. Then you get into this whole great resignation thing, which I do not believe is an anti-work movement. I think people want to work hard. They want to redefine how and why they work and they want to design a life around their work. They want independence. They want to be self-reliant. They want flexibility and freedom. That all leads to the same thing, which I actually think we may have, through the pandemic, accidentally reemerged into a new golden age of entrepreneurship. I think this one's going to last quite some time. Patrick: What are the countervailing wins to that story that you think we at least need to acknowledge? Stands out distinct memory, when Tobi described this idea that it used to be a great path to entrepreneurship is go to some town, see what it has, print that out in your town conceptually, but now, there's a scale player for every one of those things that's got this scale and scope advantage. The local sole proprietor model might be harder. What do you think are the counterveiling forces to small to medium business entrepreneurship? Harley: There are a lot. Because more people can access entrepreneurship and start a business, more people will, but that's where I think people get caught up in a little bit of the zero sum thinking where, ""I'm not going to start a sustainable sneaker company because Allbirds did it."" Adams also did it and they've done an amazing job as well. It's simply just a different audience. I loved the episode with Tobi. Tobi and I were closely together, but it's always fun to hear him on this podcast. He referenced Kevin Kelly's 1,000 True Fans on it, this idea that to make a living you'll need 1,000 true fans, which, by the way, I grew with Tobi and I both have a mentor in Seth Godin. Seth always talks about that, ""Don't make it for 10,000 or 100,000 people, make it for 1,000 people,"" and I think that's right. That's why I think you really need to figure out who your audience is, who your niche is. If you figure out who your true fans are, one of the examples I used to give is I don't know if remember Boosted Boards. They made the greatest electrical skateboard, but I thought it was really cool that Boosted Board was able to target people that liked technology and liked skateboards. Where that Venn diagram overlapped? That was the perfect slice of the total addressable market or the addressable market for those boards.Onewheel still set up. Onewheel actually went after a totally different demographic. You just picture in your head someone riding a Onewheel versus someone riding a Boosted Board, if you know these products, they're two very different types of people. I think you do have, obviously, a lot more competition now than ever before. The other thing that the big companies have, and one of the things we're trying to solve is they have economies of scale. That is a really, really big deal, and I don't mean economies of scale around how many people they have. I mean, what I think a lot of the big retail marketplaces have done is they've reset consumer expectation on delivery, on shipping. One of the reasons that Shopify is going beyond just eCommerce and helping people sell across Instagram and Facebook and TikTok and Snap and physical retail, but we're also going to this land of merchant solutions, which is things like payments and capital and shipping and audiences, the reason we're doing that is because one of the things about Shopify is that if you were to pretend for a second that we were a single retailer, one single aggregate, a retailer, we'd be the second largest online retailer in America after Amazon, and the second largest retailer in America is entitled to incredible economies of scale across all these solutions.What we can do then is we can give those economies a scale directly to small businesses and help them level the playing field, which I think is really quite neat. By the way, you're seeing this also just in terms of the creator economy. You have all these creators that have audiences and then you have all these brands that have great products. Last week, we announced something called Collabs. I don't want to make this about Shopify, but all we're doing is we're basically connecting people that have products and people that have audiences together. If you have an audience and you have a product, then you're good, you can do it yourself, but a lot of people have one or the other. Shopify Collabs is this way of actually connecting them. The creator economy is a hundred billion dollar industry, yet only 4% of creators are able to do it full time because they aren't unable to make enough money from it. We're trying to solve for that and connect them as well. There are challenges to competing with the big guys, but I think there's also great opportunities like flexibility. I mean, small businesses were far more flexible during the pandemic than the big companies were.",3096
9,Harley Finkelstein - Building the Entrepreneurship Company,Delivering and Applying Good Advice in Business," Patrick: One of the things I'm obviously obsessed with, because I spend a lot of my time through this platform and elsewhere doing it, is disseminating good and useful and general purpose ideas about building stuff. I think, though, there's a challenge of hearing a good idea and then applying it with very different skill. Searching for them and applying them is very different. You mentioned Seth Godin there as a mentor. I'm curious what Seth has taught you. I'm even more curious more generally what you've learned about taking good advice and actually applying it to the benefit of your business. What I'm always scared of is delivering all these empty calories, nice sounding ideas that make people nod their heads. Harley: Tobi calls it fortune cookie advice. Patrick: Yeah, fortune cookie advice. Oftentimes, the best sounding advice is very fortune cookie and then it's, ""Well, now what?"" I'm really curious what you've learned personally about how to select the ideas and the mentors and the people in the first place and then how to operationalize that advice in a productive way that's not just wheel spinning. Harley: I don't think there is one mentor or one person, frankly, even one company that any one listening should try to emulate entirely. That was a huge learning for me. When I was younger, particular in my early 20s, I would meet these people, I'd be incredibly impressed with them, and I would just want to do everything that they were doing. The problem is you were only seeing one side, one particular perspective of their life. One of the things I began to do in the last five or six years are to actually categorize these mentors, these advisors in my life. Everyone would think that the reason that Seth Godin is a great mentor and a friend is because he's the greatest marketer on the planet. A lot of what I do is marketing. I have learned far more from Seth about marriage and about parenting than I have about marketing. He may listen to this, and I've learned a lot about marketing. If you want, I'll tell you some of my favorite Seth Godin going stories, one of which I think is probably relevant, and I'll bring it up in just a minute, but his relationship with Helene and with his sons is incredible, and I don't just mean he calls them a lot. Just he is there for them in a way that I don't know a lot of husbands or fathers are.When Lindsay and I got married, I was looking for some relationship role models, and when we had our first child, Bailey, I was looking for parenting role models. When Shopify went public, I started looking for public company executive role models. I think you actually have to have a bunch of these different ones and then aggregate them and aggregate their information. I think you also have to have this asterisks in your mind constantly saying, ""I still probably don't know the whole story and I can take one thing or I can take this tactic that they use, but I also have to understand they're maybe in a very different circumstance than I am."" Maybe Seth's able to be a better husband than I am because he's at home more than I do. I travel a ton. He tends not to travel as much, but creating this personal board of directors where you have these categories of different mentors I think is important. Then I think what's even more important is to swap them out over time. It doesn't mean that they become bad mentors, it means that you and your circumstances are going to change, you're going to grow, your life is going to evolve and as your life evolves, so should the people in your life that you're taking advice from or that are influencing you.By the way, the story that I was going to mention that is one of my favorite Seth Godin stories, which actually is a wonderful story for any entrepreneur listening. He tells the story. I'm going to butcher this quite a bit, but he was in Momofuku, I think it was David Chang's opening or something like that in New York City at the new Momofuku. He was sitting down, he was ordering Brussels sprouts, which is now a famous dish in the Momofuku menu, and he said, ""I don't want the bacon."" The server said, ""I'm sorry. It comes with bacon."" Seth says, ""I can't eat bacon, and it's cheaper for you if you don't add the bacon, so just remove it."" The server said, ""I'm sorry. We can't do that."" David Chang came out or some manager came out and said, ""Mr. Godin, I'm sorry but this is how we serve it,"" and they went back and forth, and eventually the manager said, ""This place is probably not for you,"" and that's when Seth knew that David Chang was going to be a huge success.The reason that story is important is because it's such a great way to story tell an idea about you can't be everything to everyone. Pick your niche. Going back to Kevin Kelly, pick your niche. So I pick up these stories, these anecdotes, and I put them into my pocket from all these amazing people that I get to meet and over time, I'm really fortunate I get to meet more of these people and I combine them all into a plan. I can pull on these stories and these anecdotes and this advice all the time. What's really neat is I've been doing this personal board of directors thing since I was a kid, since I was 16 years old. The mentor of mine who convinced me to go to law school, he's been my mentor since I was 16 years old. He just took a liking to me and I liked him and I learned a lot from him. He'll probably listen too. By the way, he's on his second or third marriage. He's not a relationship role model and he knows it, but the way that he thinks about investing, for example, very, very long term focus on investing. Multi-generational compounding is something that I had not encountered from anyone else. So I put that lesson in my pocket, but I would never take advice from him on marriage. I think discerning those things I think is really important. Patrick: Is there a piece of fortune cookie advice that is as ubiquitous as possible that you think is terrible? Harley: This is a bit of recency bias, but one thing we're talking a lot about right now is this weird strange thing about micromanagement being bad. I think that is bad fortune cookie advice. I think that the best leaders that I know, they're up here and they're thinking about the big picture and the big strategy and the big vision, but man, every single great leader I know running companies is also in the weeds and the details. Whether that's writing code or that's tweaking a press release or that is putting a deal together like the contract together themself, I think the micromanagement thing is total crock of shit, if I can say that. I don't know anyone incredibly great at what they do who's not sometimes in the details. Micromanagement is used by people to say, ""Well, my boss is micromanaging me,"" or ""This person is micromanaging me."" Often, not always, but in some cases because someone's not doing their job properly, someone's not doing it at the level of quality of execution that probably it should be, that would be one fortune cookie.I think right now there's a huge hate on education. Forget school. Who needs school? Go learn it yourself on podcasts and YouTube. That's becoming, certainly in my tech world, that's becoming a lot more prevalent of a fortune cookie advice. I think that's also bullshit. I don't think school is for everybody. If you don't want to go to school, don't go, but I think there is a way for you to be incredibly selfish about school, meaning you go, you pay your tuition and you demand that that university gives you the requisite proportionate amount of skills back in return, and if they don't, that's bad. That's the pendulum swinging. Everyone should go to university and no one should go to university. There are some people that can go to school to the right programs. Law school for me was incredibly important, impactful way more than business school was, and I never really was a lawyer. I learned how to write in law school. That in itself was worth the tuition.",1833
10,Harley Finkelstein - Building the Entrepreneurship Company,The Pendulum of Distribution Strategies," Patrick: My personal interest in business has always been this pendulum that swings between product and distribution back and forth. I'm in one of these phases where I'm getting more and more interested in distribution again. I actually have a book right in front of me called How Brands Grow by an Australian professor. Last name is Sharp, I think. It was one of these first books on marketing that was very quantitative, and it was very counterintuitive in many ways. His conclusion basically was if you look at the data, there is no such thing as delighted customers and brand loyalty. There is just habit and what he calls mental and physical availability of the product, how easily can I call it to mine, understand it, and get it when I want something that it solves the problem. I'm curious what your philosophy of marketing and distribution is since you've done so much of it. I think the romantic notion would be that there is nice loyalty to a brand based on the quality of its product or something. Always will certainly be true in niche markets, but this book is really about big companies, big markets that when you get to that scale, it really isn't that. It's just how often are you in front of the person and available in their habit flow. What do you think about that angle on marketing, which I view as not romantic but maybe very pragmatic and right? Harley: I think it's right. There's this incredible romance around customer affinity and brand loyalty, and I think most of it is masking what is really happening. For the vast majority of the entrepreneurs and merchants on Shopify, they spend most of their day in Shopify, in the admin. When they say they're going to work in the morning, what they really mean is they're opening up their laptop or going to their desktop or their mobile phone if they're on the go, and they're running their business through Shopify. That's great. That is an enviable position for us to be in, but in order for us to maintain that position in their lives, it means that over time as their business expands or as they think about expanding their business, they're going to need more from Shopify. That's really challenging. The relationship we have with our millions of stores is basically different on a store-to-store basis. For some people, we're their inventory management system. For others, we're their eCommerce provider. For others, we're their bank because we have a four billion dollar capital loans business. We're their shipper and fulfillment provider in other cases.One of the things we believe that Shopify is it needs to make the important things really easy and everything else possible. So when you're just getting started and you're at your mom's kitchen table and you're thinking about starting a business, let me see what happens here. It has to be so easy to get up and running. If you have success, over time you're going to need cross-border tax compliance and you're going to need distribution, marketing ad campaigns. You're going to want analytics. Maybe you're going to want to be able to cross-sell across a bunch of different channels like Instagram and TikTok because that's where your target consumers are spending their time. The complexity of Shopify has to reveal itself over time, but only at the right time. If it reveals itself at the wrong time, we intimidate you. If it doesn't reveal itself at all or reveals itself too late, you feel like Shopify is not scaling with the size of your business. That challenge is one of the things we obsess over. The people that are on Shopify, for the most part, the people that I speak to really love Shopify. They love Shopify not because Shopify is their friend or it's someone that they like. They like Shopify because Shopify is their partner. That is conditional. It is not unconditional. They will drop us from being their partner the moment that they think either we are not scaling with them or when we're not future-proofing their business. We went public in 2015.We did a dual listing on New York Stock Exchange and the Toronto Stock Exchange. When we were going public, you do the road show. I think we met 93 investors on the road. It was one of my favorite couple of weeks of my life. I love telling Shopify's story and it was really fun for me. On the road, we kept hearing that, ""You guys are eCommerce, stick to eCommerce. What are you guys focusing on payments for? What are you thinking? Why are you doing physical retail? You are eCommerce. eCommerce is where it's at."" Of course, we explain that what we're trying to build here is this retail operating system, but ultimately, I didn't have this term then and I wish I did, but ultimately, what we've been trying to do is future-proof our merchant's businesses, so that when you select Shopify, you know that if in five years from now AR and VR or mixed reality is going to be the greatest sales channel, there's a pretty good chance Shopify will be in that. That's the reason why you see me yesterday or two days ago tweeting about AR and VR commerce. It's not to say the millions of stores are going to use it today, it's to let them know and remind them that at some point they may want to do this. When they do, it will be available to them. I believe that is how you build brand loyalty. It's not because they like the logo or Shopify is sending them Christmas gifts, it's because they believe we're their partner and we have to requalify to be their partner every single year. The second we don't, we don't deserve their business anymore. Patrick: What do you think have been the most effective distribution strategies that you yourself have overseen or seen work inside of Shopify that might be portable? You might be able to say, ""Okay. This idea is applicable to some other business lines, some other pieces of software,"" et cetera. Harley: I think one of the most interesting parts of the Shopify story, and I was very lucky that I got to play a big role in it my first year, for sure, at Shopify, my first couple of years is the partner ecosystem. In 2021, our partner ecosystem, these are app developers and themed designers and agencies, they generated about 32 billion dollars in revenue in 2021. That's up about 45% from the year before. Our partners made seven times more than Shopify's revenue in 2021. That's cool. That's a nice step, but why is that important? Because of this, the partner ecosystem, in two ways, has helped us dramatically. If you just think about the app store, what the app store has done, and there's now 9,000 apps in the app store and it goes across almost every category that a merchant could think of. Patrick: This would be like a Klaviyo. Harley: Yeah, exactly or it could be accounting, it could be email marketing, it could be in any category. There's, I don't know, 50 categories in the app store. It means that no matter what your exact use case is, you will find product market fit through Shopify, and it allows us as a company to focus on what is the 80% that every merchant needs? What most is purchasing most of the time, let's make that world class. That is what you get out of the box of Shopify, things like checkout, for example. We need to have the greatest checkout on the planet. That last 20% is going to be fairly unique and individual on a per merchant basis. If you are a European sneaker company and you want to sell to American consumers, you probably need to have some sneaker size conversion. That's great, but most other businesses are not going to need that. So we're not going to build that into the core product, but you may need that. So the app store may provide you something like that. It will fill that last 20% or 5% that Shopify doesn't do because it's unique to your business. We focus on the stuff that really, really matters, but you as a merchant gets 100% product market fit. That's on the product enhancing side of the partner program.On the distribution side, in the last 12 months, more than 40,000 agencies and freelancers referred one or more merchants to Shopify. In the early days where we were just all in one office, we were 20 people in one office in Ottawa, Canada, the way that we were able to expand to places in Europe and Asia and South America and Lat Am was by partners. We found these amazing agencies and sometimes it was hand-to-hand combat. I would just call them or Tobi would just call them and say, ""Hey, we saw you build one store on Shopify. We'd like you to build more stores and we will incentivize you to build these stores by sending you leads through our expert directory. We'll incentivize you through commercial terms, giving you a 20% rev share. Everything we collect, you get 20%. This way, you get now some perpetuity, some recurring revenue in your business because most agents don't have recurring revenue."" They became a distributed sales force for us. That was so helpful in the early days. So in one hand, they made our product better, and even as we're sitting here, there are thousands of that partners thinking about how to improve Shopify's product. One, they help us make our product better, and two, they help us on distribution, and that flywheel now has become a real moat around our business. There are other partner programs, but we've been at it for so long and every year it gets bigger and bigger. I think they call it the Bill Gates line, but this will create more value for your partners than you capture for yourself. We've been doing that for 10 plus years now. Patrick: It's also an interesting example of embedding in adjacent ecosystems, where it's much harder to, let's say, change away from Shopify if it also means you need to change away from five other vendors, and maybe some of these have their app on some other similar platform elsewhere, but it is a really interesting embedding that also creates a marketing effect that seems possible in the world of the internet and software generally that probably isn't used enough, and I'm sure it was hard to build at the beginning. I'm curious what that was like. How did you get the first Klaviyo or the first app developer to do this in the earliest days? It makes a ton of sense now. You've aggregated demand effectively. Of course, they're going to want to build there. Harley: It's super tough in the early days. In fact, in the early days, you have to do stuff that just doesn't scale, meaning you have to provide commercial terms that simply you're not going to be able to do long term. You can do it for a year or two, but longer term you can't. It's classic chicken and egg. The more partners you have referring merchants or building apps for you, the more merchants are getting value. Therefore, the more app developers want to come on to build for you. You want to be able to eventually get this network effect going whereby more merchants, more app developers, more merchants or app developers, and then flywheel starts to spin, but in the early days, no, you have very, very little. So there were a couple things we did I think that just didn't scale but were really very helpful. One, we had deep relationships with the partners, and I know it just means we would call them time to time. We really brought them into our bubble, and we explained to them, ""Hey, if you can show us value now, as we grow, you will have an unfair advantage because you'll be able to see so much more business come your way."" That's the only way to kickstart, the cold start issue of chicken and egg when you're building one of these things.I remember on the app store, the iOS store was paying 70/30 split at the time to app developers. 70% would go to the app developers and 30% would go to Apple. We were doing 80/20, so 80% would go to the app developer. If you were selling a $10 product, you simply made more money by being listed on the Shopify app store. The other part is, and this again goes back to the hand-to-hand combat thing, when I would call these app developers or any of these partners to get them involved, I would explain that this is an opportunity to get in very, very early, and by being in very early, you will have access, you will have influence that you're not going to get later on, and so on us the way we bet on you. There were a lot of partners that today are big part is on Shopify. They're big companies that in the early days simply did not want to participate because, simply, it wasn't worth their time. There wasn't a return on investment from a development perspective. They much prefer to go build on force.com or Salesforce or something. So I would say, ""Well, look, yes, Salesforce may have at the time a larger base of customers. We have less customers, but you're one of three.""",2878
11,Harley Finkelstein - Building the Entrepreneurship Company,Interesting Trends in E-Commerce," Patrick: You've obviously been both an enabler of and a beneficiary of trends in E-commerce. You could see the famous charts. I think it was actually maybe Shopify that put out the most recent one that showed the pre-COVID trend line adoption of eCommerce that spiked up in 2020 and 2021 and seems to be going back towards that mean. Tell us how you would describe the state of eCommerce today. What about eCommerce writ large is interesting? What do you think is going on with that adoption curve? What do you see from the inside that you think are the most important trends? Harley: During the pandemic, eCommerce retail searched. It probably jumped forward three to five years in a couple of months. In the trend line, I think you're talking about that Tobi had posted, I think Ben Evans had also posted a blog post about this called Return to the Trend Line or Back to the Trend Line I think it was called. The calculation that everyone is thinking about when it comes to retail is eCommerce as a percentage of total retail. The numerator is eCommerce, the denominator is total retail, eCommerce plus physical commerce. During the pandemic, you saw the numerator grow, obviously, but you saw the denominator also gets smaller because physical retail basically shut down. You saw this massive spike up in this eCommerce as a percent of total retail equation, this ratio. Now that retail is rebalancing and physical retail is reopening, it looks like eCommerce is reverting back to the trend line because your denominator is now getting so much bigger because physical retail just reopens, so it's huge again. That misses the entire point. eCommerce has still grown substantially. The Ben Evans article, which talks about which trend, which penetration should be looking at, no matter what, eCommerce is now bigger than it was pre-pandemic. That's the case for two reasons. On the consumer side, anyone that was in the laggard category of buying something on the internet or buying something online, whether it's a physical product or it's using a great service like DoorDash or Instacart, they had no choice but to use those and do so during the pandemic.Now that things have come back, my grandparents, and I'm really lucky my grandparents are still alive, they're in their nineties, they used Instacart. They live in Canada. They used Instacart during the pandemic, especially during the wintertime when they couldn't leave their apartment and a lot of snow in Montreal. They still use Instacart today. One, on the consumers side, we have retrained those that weren't thinking of eCommerce, they are now using eCommerce. That's on the demand side. On the supply side, one of the major things that we saw at Shopify was when the pandemic hit, people were not allowed to go out and physical stores closed. We saw a ton of these physical retailers, single-channel retailers, so they only had an offline store, a physical store, and a place on a street. They came to Shopify to move online. They did so, and in some cases played a huge role in allowing their business to continue, but now that things have rebalanced, they now are multichannel. They're not shutting down their online store. In fact, they have now an online store and an offline store and they're beginning to think about omnichannel as not being a feature or some neat tactic, but actually the steady state of their actual business. We definitely played a big role in this and we actually changed our roadmap and prioritized a lot of tools being in a pandemic to help these physical retailers stay alive overnight, so things like curbside pickup, for example. I think in terms of the graph that you were referencing, just want to be clear here, the denominator contracted incredibly and swung around, and now that online and offline are both back together, you have a more normalized view of things, but eCommerce has permanently shifted upwards and I think that'll continue. That's the first thing.The second thing is I think generally, just on the omnichannel selling across offline and online, the way we talk about this has to evolve. It is so archaic. If you listen to an earnings call from a large retailer, I'm just going to pick on one, I'm going to say Best Buy, for example, there's a good chance at almost every earnings call you're going to hear this term, which is channel conflict, meaning online is turning offline or offline is turning online. I know you and I share a friend in Trina from FIGS. If you listen to a FIGS earnings call, you do not hear channel conflict, neither is the folks at Allbirds. Any of these great companies that have earnings calls, these modern direct to consumer companies, they're not talking about channel conflict because fundamentally, it's all just sales. They are meeting their customer wherever they are. I've joked recently that talking about omnichannel feels a little bit like talking about the color television in 2022 because you don't say color TV. Every TV is effectively a color television and it's just going to be about sell wherever your customers are. I think we tend to look at penetration as addressable market. I think the current argument is that the addressable market is less useful as more retailers are omnichannel. Tesla sells cars online. Half of US restaurants sell off-premises for takeout. Patrick: I'm curious what you've learned about the digital places that people are buying and any interesting trends that are happening there. I stopped going to Instagram because it's feeling like smoking cigarettes or something, but when I was on there, I would find, if I look back in time, doesn't feel like I am, but I bought several things on Instagram like if something came up in my feed with very effective ad unit that knew something and I wanted it and I bought it, a pair of shoes, or whatever. I followed some of these live shopping trends or companies with some interest. What are interesting trends there in terms of the literal digital place that somebody is when they're hitting buy relative to just going to a normal website and building a cart and checking out? Are there trends in the eCommerce there and the interactive layer and the digital place that are of interest to you? Harley: We announced a couple weeks ago an integration with YouTube, live shopping on YouTube. It was really neat. I got a chance to do a bit of a road show about it, and Susan at YouTube talked a lot about it, which is really an interesting experience, but the reason that that one in particular was so exciting for us is because, basically, the gist of it is that now with live shopping in YouTube, you can be watching a video, you can be watching a MrBeast video and he may be talking about Feastables, and you can actually buy and check out, complete the transaction and never have to hit the pause button on the video. We're doing the same thing with TikTok, where we actually embed commerce directly into the TikTok video so you don't have to leave the video. The reason that's important is it's not necessarily world-changing and mind-blowing stuff, but to your point, some of the stuff happening around social commerce, for example, which we see growing dramatically year on year, and in the last quarter it was up by somewhere like 4x since last year, so it's still very small relative to all of digital commerce or commerce in general, but it's growing rapidly, but it still feels a little bit clunky. You click something and then you click something else and eventually get to a checkout page. It has a prefilled cart and then you checkout. The neat part about what I think is happening, this has just happened in the last couple of months, is that now by embedding commerce directly in these services, whether it's TikTok or it's YouTube, it means that there's far less friction.Actually, to say what you want about the comparison of social media to cigarettes and being addictive, there's some truth to that in some ways. It is a wonderful place to discover new things. It is a wonderful place to see people you trust or that you follow endorse a particular product. I love my Ember mug. It's a great product. Your coffee, your tea, whatever it is, it's always going to be the perfect temperature. What a great feature. I learnt about this because, randomly, someone that I follow on Instagram bought an Ember, and like most people that buy Embers get obsessed with it for a little bit of time, and I was like, ""Oh, this is really, really cool,"" but I probably had to do four or five clicks to go from that place where I discovered Ember to actually a checkout. I think over time that's going to get much, much better. To your other point in terms of where you are, there's always this assumption that because of my role at Shopify and me being at Shopify that I think the future retail is digital only. No way. I think the future of retail is going to be wherever the hell you want to buy. I think physical retail is going to play a really big role here. I mean, GMV sales from our physical retail merchants grew almost 50% year on year this past quarter. We are seeing massive growth in physical retail, and it's because a lot of our modern retailers who started their businesses online are moving offline. That never happened before. Used to be physical retailers started, you built your business, you had leasehold improvements, you bought inventory, you painted the walls, you hired staff. If there was some success, you then decided to move online as well. Now, it's happening in the reverse order, and I think that's allowing more people to participate.",2087
12,Harley Finkelstein - Building the Entrepreneurship Company,Lessons from Being Public," Patrick: You mentioned the road show with investors being one of your favorite times. I'm curious what it's been like going through a period where you were maybe the all-time Wall Street darlings in terms of performance, interest in the business, and attention to a period where it's been very different where the stock's gone down a lot. Those things have happened in such crazy succession, and obviously, there's a million companies that have gone through this, something similar, especially those that are very digital or internet-oriented. What has that been like as an executive inside the business? What do you think you're better at now or the things you're glad that you've learned through that experience? Harley: It's challenging. There's two things that are important. One is you need to compartmentalize. We did something we thought it was a good idea. It turns out it was a great idea. When things are really going well, stock price in the equity markets over the last couple of years prior to the pandemic, we went public again in 2015, the three or four or five years after that, it was quite good. Shopify's stock performed quite well. When that was happening, we had these days where the company would go up by 10 or 15% in one day. We would say to the company, ""Just so we're clear, we did not get 10 or 15% better today."" The reason that turns out that was even more important is because when we go down that amount in one day, we remind the company that we didn't get 10 or 20% worse today. We were sober about the run up and it has come down. One is reminding yourself that you are not your stock price. The value that we provide, the millions of stores that are on Shopify, they rely on us. They don't give a shit whether or not we're sad or we're happy about the stock price. They are trying to provide to their families. Everyone talks about mission-driven companies, but that's what actually it means. It means that no matter what is happening around you, if you are deeply mission-driven, our mission is to help entrepreneurs, full stop, and if you're mission-driven, you really care about the people you are serving, and for us those are entrepreneurs, you got to compartmentalize. You got to get back to work, put your head down and do the work because they rely on us.The second that we stop doing the work and they stop relying on us, we deserve to fail and we don't want to fail. We want to be the world's entrepreneurship company. We're not there yet. In our view, there's never been an entrepreneurship company. We think we have the best shot at being that. We're working towards that. All that really means, by the way, is when people think about starting a business, they're default next step is signing up for Shopify. That's the first thing. The second part is it is important to really communicate well. It's important to story tell and have a really good narrative, which is a huge part of my job. It is now important. It's always been important, but it's more important now to ensure we are communicating our strategy, that we are communicating not necessarily we're doing five or 10 years. People won't understand what are all these pieces. How do you reconcile a company that's building logistics for small businesses but that also has a capital business and that's also launching live shopping on YouTube at the same time that we're launching audiences, which is a new thing we're doing to help merchants increase their return to ad spend.You have to be able to stitch this together in a way that investors understand. You don't have to, I guess, but it does provide you with cover. If your investors, your long-term investors that have been with you, and we're really lucky, we've investors that have owned the stock since the IPO and continue to buy all throughout this period, if they understand where you're going and they have a deep understanding of who you are and how you think about the world, they will provide you with cover. I think those two things are really important. I don't think you should be overly obsessed with Wall Street or investor relations, but I also think it's important to properly tell a good story, to let them in and explain to them the rationale of some of your decisions. Don't let them dictate it, but explain to them what is happening, and we're trying to get better at that every day. Patrick: What are one or more tips that you would share with others that have to communicate with Wall Street that you found effective? What do you think the right amount of detail and complexity is or just ways of packaging strategy in a way that an investor who probably on average is spending single digits percent of their time, for sure, on your company, if you're lucky, maybe low single digits percentage and making sure something lands? I'm just curious what you've learned about doing that effectively. Harley: One thing that was very helpful was we went public around the same time as a couple of other companies did, the Zendesk and New Relic and a few others. HubSpot I think was around the same time. Wix, I think as well. So there were a couple other companies that went around. So I mean, I got a chance to speak to them and ask questions about how are they doing this and how are they doing that. That was helpful to some extent. What actually was even more helpful is to very quickly identify who are the best investors that are going to be really good long-term partners. Ultimately, that's what they are. They own your stock. Figure out who they are and then spend time disproportionately with them. One of the things you do when you spend more time with them is you start asking more questions and you got to understand, ""How are they building their models? Oh, I see. They're building their model in a way that doesn't actually make sense because we're doing this other thing over here.""If they are confused about your business, doesn't mean your business is not going to do well or the stock won't go in the right direction. It's just going to mean you're going to repeat yourself a lot, but if they actually understand your business, it means that they are going to continue writing the journey with you and that is really helpful from an intention unit perspective. It means you can focus on the business. Picking the right investors early on that will be with you on the ride for two, three decades is really valuable, and then asking them questions rather than speaking at them like at monologue. Finding out, ""Okay. What are the things that you don't understand? What are the things that we're not saying that you're really curious about?"" there are ways to do so if you are specific and you are thoughtful about how you're allocating your attention units from an investor perspective. Patrick: Is there an investor that stands out in your mind that you've met that does things the right way, that you're really impressed by? Harley: Well, someone we met on the road show who's been a part of our story pretty much the whole time has been Henry Ellenbogen, who was at T. Rowe and now is at Durable, he's incredible, Will Danoff at Fidelity. These are people that really do their work. Henry's unique because Henry was the last of the 93 meetings on the road show. He was number 93. I met him and his team. They're fantastic people, but the quality of discourse and conversation with them is so high. You read their reports and their notes. They understand the merchants and they understand the partners. They understand the infrastructure. They understand everything about our business. They understand the team. They understand the team dynamics. They understand culture. Those are special investors, and because of that, you want to give them more time and because of that, they have a better understanding of the business, and because of that, you build much longer term relationships. You don't necessarily get that by peanut buttering across the entire investment community. You do that specifically. Patrick: What about the world that you operate and haven't we talked about that you think is important or interesting today? Harley: I think being a public company notwithstanding stock price fluctuations and recessions and bear markets is actually a wonderful way to be a long-term independent company. If you want to build something long term and you want to be independent and you want to be able to be well-capitalized, we bought a company a couple weeks ago called Deliver, just over a two billion dollar company, which really has accelerated our product roadmap for fulfillment. The fact that we can do that and we still have another five or so billion dollars on our balance sheet, that is made far easier by being publicly traded. We could raise that kind of money as a private company, but I actually think that there's something about being publicly traded that allows you to be more effective on the fundraising side. All your disclosures are public, it forces a lot of creativity. You have to be thoughtful about certain things because quarterly earnings are not always fun and can be a distraction, but it also becomes a really good forcing function, ensuring that you are sharp and you are focused, that the business is humming the way you want it to be.It also gives you an opportunity to say, ""Hey, I don't like the way that's working. Let's go make a change,"" or ""I don't think that's the right leader in that position. Let's go make a change."" I don't know necessarily this is the case. I have had a lot of conversations it feels like in the last couple weeks with great companies that are late stage private companies that are basically saying, ""We're just not going to go public,"" and I said, ""Well, you're not going to go public now. I understand why. It's not a great time to go public, but don't see you're not going to go public."" I actually think there was a lot of benefit to going public. For us, we're basically commerce infrastructure for millions of stores, for your favorite brands, for consumers' favorite brands. Being publicly traded, I think, gives them a little bit more confidence that we're going to be around for the long run. I live in Canada. There has not been very many large scale independent publicly traded companies in Canada. I want there to be more of them. I want to see more acquirers not acquirees here in Canada and I know it's easy to get acquired, but I also think it's potentially and certainly has been for us far more rewarding and allows us to be far more ambitious by being independent. Going public was a big part of that.",2324
13,Harley Finkelstein - Building the Entrepreneurship Company,The Power of Motivating People," Patrick: I think it'd be fun to close on something about the power of motivating people and go all the way back to your DJing days. What did you learn about that formula? You said it was so cool you watched a DJ be able to change a bunch of awkward 13-year-olds into a mosh pit in three minutes. What was the formula there? What did you learn about motivating people through that specific function that worked? Harley: One is reading the crowd. You can tell very quickly by looking at the crowd whether or not what you are playing or saying is resonating or not, and if it's not, changed. It's analogous to pivoting in a small business. If your customer doesn't like what you're doing, change the music. If they're not into disco, go into Motown. I think anyone that's ever DJed or performed for a crowd would say that any speaker would say that. A couple things actually that come to mind that I think might be interesting. One of the things you have to do in a bar mitzvah setting is what's called the hora. You dance around in a circle and the bar mitzvah boy goes up in a chair and do it at weddings as well. The hora is fun for 5% of the crowd and incredibly cringe-worthy for 95% cause no one really knows what to do, and if you haven't been to one, you don't know what it is. There was always this problem that I had, which is how do I get this entire party, 300 people, on the dance doing the hora? They're all sitting down, they're all talking, drinking and eating, and whatever. What I would always do right before the hora is I would do the candle lighting ceremony.Basically, I would have the bar mitzvah boy or the bat mitzvah girl on the dance floor middle, they would light the candles and I would ask everyone to get up and take 20 steps forward onto the dance floor, and I would say, ""We are going to blow up the candles."" Now, you can say no to dancing, but you're not going to say no to the blowing out of the candles because that's the only reason you're there is to celebrate this person on this special day. Everyone is already on the dance floor, we blow up the candles and immediately you go into the hora. My success rate was, I don't know, 99% that everyone was doing the hora because they're already in the same spot. Trying to bring that back to business or company building, there are things that you can do. If you want to make water flow down a mountain in a particular direction, carve divots in the right place and the water will flow where you want, and DJing did a lot of that for me, and I use that a lot today. If I want to get someone's attention, there are things that I can do to get their attention before I need them to do something for me. Patrick: There's something embedded in the first part of the answer I just want to pick on a little bit, which is read the crowd, and if it's not working, change. I guess that sounds obvious in something like music where there's instant feedback. You'd know if it's working or not. Does that translate completely into business in your experience? At least in my experience, it seems more and more that stuff that works or that's going to work often works really fast. Even if it's something that's really hard to build or there's a long period of fixed investment or research or something, it's usually really well-received really quickly. Have you experienced that at Shopify? Did you feel as though the things that have worked have always worked from the jump or have there been examples where something that turned out to be big went through a long period of really not working? Harley: Not everything. For example, personal opinion, but I think a lot of people would agree. I think Shopify's infrastructure, the actual technology stack that these millions of stores are built on is world class. The reason you see Kiss or Billionaire Boys Club or Kylie or Kanye or MrBeast or MSCHF, one of my favorite news stores, do these massive drops, flash sales on Shopify is because, fundamentally, there's very few places that you can get that type of infrastructure. These are the largest flash sales in the history of the planet. We've never had that type of sales per minute or per second or per millisecond the way that we are seeing now when MrBeast drops Feastables or MSCHF just dropped something with Rihanna last week, a lipstick that was maybe lipstick but could also be ketchup or Kylie's new lip Kit or Kim's SKIMS. The transaction per second are nothing that any of our predecessors in retailer commerce could have ever predicted. No one is going to cheer or tell Shopify, ""Great job for my shop not going down."" We know that's important, but no one's ever going to give us feedback to say, ""That's amazing,: because everyone expects it. When it doesn't happen, they're really pissed, but when it does happen, they're not necessarily going to cheer you on.In other cases, when we first came out with Shopify point of sale in 2014, I don't think people understood what we were trying to do. They're like, ""Oh, so you do eCommerce and then for others you do physical retail?"" ""No, no, no, it's all the same. It's going to be part of this retail operating system. We want you to run all your retail operations on Shopify."" They're like, ""Yeah, yeah."" Today, the reason that online merchants also use us offline is because they want one place to manage their inventory. That's taken years for them to have somewhat of an aha moment that, ""Oh, Shopify's been building this all along, which is this incredible retail operating system that will allow me to sell anywhere."" In other cases, I mentioned Shopify audiences. We now have Shopify audiences a couple weeks ago, which, effectively, if you're a Shopify Plus merchant, you select a few of your products, a few of those products into our machine learning system, our audiences' algorithm, and we spit out a lookalike audience, and then you feed that lookalike audience into the ad platform, whether it's Instagram or it's Facebook or it's Google, and we've seen this happen pretty much across. Everyone is using it that you will have a higher return ad spend because we're able to effectively help you target the right type of audiences.The more people that opt into audiences, the better the algorithm becomes, the better the machine learning becomes, the better we can predict who may want to buy your product. The second we launched it, social media went, ""Wow."" You heard this, ""Oh, finally they're doing this."" In some cases, there's so much pent up demand for us to do that. It's obvious, but in other cases, it's behind the scenes like infrastructure or they don't realize it until a little bit later on. There is a balance between predicting the future, but also making sure that you're bringing them along for the journey because you can say, ""Look, we have this great new feature. It allows you to sell your products on Mars,"" and some merchant are going to be like, ""What are you talking about?"" In 15 years, that actually may be the Mars channel on Shopify through SpaceX. It may actually be one of the best channels to do. We have to predict that, but not necessarily looking for it, but even by saying it, they immediately start thinking about, ""Okay. Shopify is thinking so far in the future, which means that this is a company I can be my business on,"" and that matters to us. That trust matters to us. Patrick: I've learned so much today. Really appreciate all the time. It's funny that sometimes the things you remember are just these funny little stories. I will remember, and compared to this thing Scott Belsky told me about, if you go to a retail shop, the stuff in the windows is actually very rarely the stuff that you buy when you go in the store, but it gets you in the store. Your story about the blowing of the candle to get everyone on the dance floor, it's such a nice story, but I think it's also a good prompt for everyone listening if they're like, ""How could I take that concept and apply it to something I'm trying to get done? How do I aggregate the people?"" Harley: I'm friendly with the guys at Warby Parker. They're not on Shopify yet, but I hope one day they will be, but the eye doctor is that. You can go in and see an eye doctor at Warby Parker stores. They don't make any money off that, but once you're there, you get a chance to buy the glasses. The birthday candles is the optometrist, and the hora are the purchase of glasses. I don't think anyone in the history of the world has ever said what I just said. Patrick: Well, it's a perfect excuse to ask my traditional closing question. What is the kindest thing that anyone's ever done for you? Harley: Two people come to mind. The first is Tobi, him bringing me into Shopify. It changed my life. It allowed me, again, go back to the beginning, to find my life's work, but it also allowed me to find my craft of what I potentially one day will be world class at. I didn't have the credentials. I was an entrepreneur selling T-shirts and a bad lawyer, and he took a chance on me. He saw something I don't think I saw in myself. The second is my dad. Again, my dad, he never made it as a big successful entrepreneur, but that small thing, that small tactic of giving me a business card and putting Harley Finkelstein, DJ Harley Finkelstein, slipper entrepreneur Harley Finkelstein, CEO of T-shirt company, that made a huge difference. I have kids now, two daughters, Zoe's three and Bailey's six, and I think about what can I do for them. My dad could have given me money and I don't think it would've had the same effect, but by making me those silly business cards, he gave me the click spot to say, ""You know what? I can be a DJ. This business card says I can be this thing that I want to be,"" and I'm incredibly grateful to him for that. Patrick: Such an amazing, cool closing moment. I have a son and daughter rounding into that age where they're talking about what they might want to do when they grow up. They're eight and six. Very heartwarming and a wonderful place to close the conversation in the week here on a Friday afternoon. Harley, thanks so much for your time. Harley: Thank you so much. Such a pleasure being on the show, Patrick.This site uses cookies to improve your browsing experience. By using this site, you are consenting to this policy.",2441
14,Mitch Lasky - The Business of Gaming,Introduction," Patrick: My guest today is Mitch Lasky. Mitch is a partner at Benchmark and one of the leading figures in the video game industry. Over the last 30 years, he has built, led, and invested in a number of the best gaming companies in the world, including Activision, EA, Riot, Snapchat, and Discord. I couldn't think of a better person to break down the anatomy of a great gaming business, and Mitch does not disappoint. His insights are remarkable. Please enjoy this excellent conversation with Mitch Lasky.",120
15,Mitch Lasky - The Business of Gaming,Why Invest In Gaming?," Patrick: So Mitch, I was toying with where to begin our conversation today. You and I have had so many interesting conversations about these topics, and I've learned so much from you. A fun way to begin would be to talk about the investing side of the gaming industry. There's a conflict that interests me, which is that there's obviously a ton of enterprise value in this world, a lot of it private still in companies like Valve or Epic, but a lot of it public too. There's been some huge acquisitions in the last year or so since we started talking about this. But there don't seem to be very many famous gaming investors. As far as I can tell, it's you and a very small handful of others, which is strange. Why do you think that is? Why aren't there famous gaming investors, public or private, like you have in so many other sectors and industries where there's a lot of enterprise value. Mitch: It's very interesting because I think historically it's been obviously a backwater for venture. It didn't really get the attention it deserved. It was always viewed through this prism of, it's an entertainment business. It's a hit driven business. The real investors in the games business are the aggregators and the publishers, not really the venture capitalists and there wasn't really a model that was well understood by the venture industry about how you could translate success in the games business into value. Starting around 2000, maybe 2005, you started to see these, what I would call, forever games, games like World of Warcraft, later League of Legends, which I was lucky enough to be able to invest in. But you see it now with Fortnite and a number of other games, which have durability over time that never existed before. Historically with the console business and the PC business and even the mobile business, games would come and go in a fruit fly's lifespan. They were extremely short lived. You could understand from an investor's perspective how hard it would be to figure out continuity of value when you had that temporal mismatch between the way the business rolled out and the needs of the investor.That change was not well understood by the venture industry. And there were a few people like me, bill Gurley, my partner, was really a pioneer in this as well. You had a couple of others. Bing Gordon at Kleiner was very active during those years, did Zynga and a number of other really interesting investments. But really, it was generational. As we have aged out of the business to some extent, what you're now seeing is a really interesting new crop of investors coming in behind us who had learned from our experience and I think are taking it to a new... It's never been a better time in the history of venture for games companies to raise private money. I'm actually really excited about what's going on. I've made a couple of small personal investments in some of these new funds and have mentored a couple of the younger investors. I think we're going to see change over the next five years or so. Patrick: To the professional investor out there that's totally uninitiated in the business model of games, how would you describe the most important features of the modern business gaming model? And I want to talk about the history in a few minutes here too. But if we just focus today on 2022, what are the most important things for someone that's unfamiliar with this space to understand about the business model itself, in your opinion? Mitch: The key things to understand about the business model are that it is ultimately a customer acquisition, customer lifetime value business, fundamentally, like subscription businesses and other sorts of businesses. Although interestingly, the monetization models are a lot more diverse. And so it's not necessarily always just about retention, although clearly retention plays an important role. That's the most important insight. The other thing is that it's very much driven by content and network effects in a way that a lot of investors are somewhat unfamiliar or may be uncomfortable making calls because you kind of have to make an aesthetic call. It's very hard to look purely at the metrics of something, particularly at the early stage and say, ""Oh, this is going to work."" You could with a social network. Matt Kohler at Benchmark, for example, was always a savant about being able to look at a few data points from the early history of a product like Snap, for example, or Instagram, and be able to make a very clear eyed call about where it was headed just based on those data points.Much harder to do with the games business. Much easier for those metrics to be manipulated in the early days through enthusiasts coming on board early, but maybe the product not making the transition to the mass market or aggressive customer acquisition spending early on, which somewhat distorts the KPIs. So that's the part of it that I love about the games business. Obviously, I came from a publishing background. I ran the studios at Activision back in the late '90s and was the CEO of a mobile games company for a number of years in the early 2000s. And so I'm very comfortable looking at a game and saying, ""I think that there's an audience for this game,"" but it is not a skill that many venture capitalists possess. And I think it's something that scares a lot of investors when they look at the market. Patrick: How would someone acquire that skill or how did you acquire that aesthetic taste or skill? Mitch: Well, I was an incredible nerd and I just played a lot of video games during that period. I'm married to a game designer, who's in the process of finishing Elden Ring as we speak after probably investing a couple hundred hours in playing it. We're just a geeky group of people. And I probably published 250 video games in my career, worked with some of the greatest designers and I'm a curious person and I engage in a lot of conversations with these people about what it is that makes a game fun. What is their theory of fun?I have internalized a lot of that in my investing, which is, I feel like I have a really strong sense of what makes a game fun. I bring that to the table and I think that's an important skill set because it's very easy to look at the market and then take a spray and pray approach, to take an index fund approach to the games business and I think you can lose a lot of money that way.",1394
16,Mitch Lasky - The Business of Gaming,Delivering Great User Experiences," Patrick: What does make a game fun? If you had to extract out the dimensions of fun in games as you've thought about it, what are they? Mitch: I'll share one of them with you because I don't want to give away all my trade secrets. One of the things that I concentrate on that I think is overlooked quite a bit is what you do the most frequently in the game. So for example, what do you do in the game Doom, game that almost everybody of our age has played. They'll say it's a shooter. You run around and you shoot things. Yeah, you shoot things, but primarily what you do is you move in a three dimensional environment through a maze, basically. You're moving through the maze and looking around. Then, you're occasionally shooting things. You're occasionally finding keys, opening doors, finishing levels, and then progressing. For me, focusing on that high frequency activity, what is the thing in the game that you do the most frequently and is that pleasurable?Because a lot of times I will have teams come in and pitch me and they'll say, ""I want to make a game about World War I."" And I'm like, ""Okay, so what do you do in the game?"" And they're like, ""Well, it's World War I. You're in the trenches and then you're fighting,"" and really try and drill down and say, ""Okay, what's the first five minute experience? What am I doing constantly in the game that's creating that feedback loop of pleasure?"" That is a really key component of it because I think that most of the products I see that fail have a mismatch between the constancy of the activity and the pleasure of that activity. Patrick: If you think about delivering that pleasure as a sort of art form, in what ways does that differ from the art form of delivering more passive content pleasure like a movie or a show. Games are interactive. You're doing something. Do you find that the real creative geniuses behind the games possess some very different skill than you might find in a Hollywood director or producer or showrunner or something like that? Mitch: Absolutely. In fact, I think as a Hollywood producer or showrunner, you have a lot more control over the user's experience to the extent that movies are about time. They're an art form very much dedicated to time. That time is controlled, the mise-en-scène and the editing is something that you have a lot of control over as the creative. And therefore, that experience of time is very much within your control. You don't have that control at all in the games context. You can approximate it by putting the user on rails and forcing them down a path, but still, they're in control of the experience in a way that's much different than the experience of linear narrative like a movie.I remember working at one point with a developer who had done some work with an Nintendo with some of their key creatives. And one of these game directors came to the table and basically said they were going to make a game about anthropomorphic automobiles, kind of like Disney's Cars, if you will. Instead of sending them a design book and saying ""Here, execute this design,"" Nintendo executives came in and said, ""Here's the character. Here's the controller. Make the character fun to play with against a black screen. And once we feel like there's a delightful control mechanism where you can actually do fun things with the character, then we'll build the game."" It's the focus on that key constant interactivity and making that fun and then building from there. Patrick: You mentioned Doom, which seems like if we think about the modern history of games, probably the first game that matters a tremendous amount, really. The company behind Doom is a really key early timeline point in the history of modern gaming. Do you think that's the right place to start to understand where we are today is starting with Doom? Mitch: I do. I think that they are the first modern video game company in a lot of ways. I think there's a couple of components to that. First, they were very early to the idea of alternative distribution and a kind of free to play. At the time, we called it shareware. Them and Apogee in Texas had pioneered this model of giving away the first bit of the game for free and then upselling from there. I think they were a little early in that regard because they still relied on physical distribution on discs. So that made even the distribution of free software full of friction. Had they come 10 years later when the internet was more of a thing, they could have been a radical transformer of the way that software was distributed, given their proclivities. But they were just a little bit early in that regard. They were a fiercely independent developer.I was their publisher for part of their history, published Quake 3:Arena and several other of their games when I was at Activision. They were the most independent of independents. And I think they set a model that was very different than a lot of what was going on in the rest of the industry. And I think a lot of what we see now with Epic and Riot and other companies is really a direct continuity with that flag, that it planted for the concept of independent development and creative control back in the mid '90s. That was another important component of their modernity, if you will. And then also, they recognized John Carmack in particular, the power of multiplayer play and the importance of internet play, even again, in an era where the internet was poor in terms of its ability to support these kinds of games. But Quake 3: Arena was in many ways the first modern battle arena game, along with Unreal Tournament and a couple of other games, really prefigured a lot of what we now think of as the modern business. Patrick: If you had to build a timeline of the important developments in the gaming business through just individual games, and let's say Doom was the first game on that timeline, what would be the other games on that timeline through to today that you think are the most representative games of major evolutions of the model of the business itself? Mitch: Thinking about it purely in terms of the business model, because that's what interests me about this, I would say Half-Life would be the next game that I would put on that list. And I would put it on the list, not necessarily because I think it was a milestone of creativity, although it was ae really a great game, but more that what Valve built around the game ended up becoming Steam, which is one of the most important distribution vectors in the history of the video game business, the first and still, probably most successful online distributor of video games in the world, multi-billion dollar business.At one point, represented double digit percentage of industry revenues in terms of what was flowing through Steam. And in many ways, Steam was originally an updater for Half-Life and Half-Life 2, and CS:GO and a number of these other products that have come out of it, were enabled and spawned by the fact that Steam existed and that they were the first to be able to bring that gaming community together in a single online location and become a platform based publisher, a concept that nobody really conceived of before. After that World of Warcraft in 2004. You'd seen graphical, three-dimensional MMOs, but the first one to really spark the popular imagination and to become a real mass market phenomenon was World of Warcraft. So I think from a business perspective, enabling a subscription business around that was an incredibly important milestone. And then League of Legends. Patrick: Obviously, you were incredibly involved with League of Legends and Valve too. It allows us to talk about your concept of platform based publishers. I really like this concept. And it's also a great excuse to start talking about the various components of the gaming business and its supplier value chain of creating a game and where profits accrue. I've talked in the past about the gaming engines, the publishers, the distributors, the creative studios, et cetera. These are all different parts of delivering a great game experience. So maybe talk about this platform based publisher notion that you have. It's a very powerful business model. Mitch: In order to really explain it, I'm going to have to explain a little bit about what it replaced. Historically, you were selling shiny discs. Originally, you were selling little plastic floppies. I remember buying some of the Lucasarts games, the adventure games back in the '80s, and they would ship on 17 floppy discs. The cost of goods was just ridiculous. But the CD-rom was really the primary distribution vehicle for video games, really, up until this century and even still, you're still buying some console games on shiny discs. And so the shiny discs, in order to get that into commerce, you got to press them. You got to fix the game in a moment in time when a gold master is actually possible, and then that gets imprinted on the discs. And those get packaged and there's cost associated with that. It's an industrial process. And then, those are shipped out to retailers and you have to build an advertising campaign that drives people into retail to purchase those units and then take them home and install them. And hopefully, you can manage to get them online so you can update them if there are bugs. And it's a very different world than the world we live in today where League of Legends is being updated daily or weekly. And every time you come online, you're getting a patch downloaded, et cetera.That was the world we came from. To use Ben Thompson's aggregation theory as a way to think about this, it was a world where control of the distribution end of things, rolling up supply in order to create demand, became the principle role of the publisher. But in the modern world where these platforms have now emerged online, like the League of Legends environment, like Epic's game store and Fortnite, like Steam, like Game Pass from Microsoft, there's a number of interesting modern examples. They're actually aggregating the demand. They're bringing a community of users together online. When that happens, it changes the nature of the supply side of the business. That's been one of the most interesting evolutions of the video game business over the last decade is the rise of these aggregation platforms that have managed to bring demand together online, such that you now see Activision, Electronic Arts publishing their games on Steam, something that would've been unheard of in a previous era, because they want to fish where the fish are because Steam has been able to aggregate this massive audience of gamers who are already pre-qualified. You got to be there. That's my concept of platform based publishing. And it's not unique to me. It's pretty obvious to the community, but I don't think people have talked about it really enough in terms of its effect on the video game business broadly.",2379
17,Mitch Lasky - The Business of Gaming,Business Lessons From Game Development and Distribution," Patrick: Because this concept can be applied to other industries, it's worth double clicking on a little bit the chicken or egg problem of this. The creation of Steam, you already mentioned, was sort of a means to an end based on Half-Life or Half-Life 2, a way of delivering something that made the game better. Talk about how some of these big aggregators have been able to get going in the first place. It seems like a tremendous cold start problem. To aggregate demand, you got to do something to get the demand where you are. What have been the interesting strategies you've seen work there. The best example, Steam, resulted from a game, not from them creating a platform to distribute 100 games. Mitch: There's been two paths to the creation of these platform based publishers. One of them quite obviously is take an existing aggregation and migrate it into the games domain. So I think Tencent is probably the world's most important example of this, where you have QQ and WeChat, and you have a billion users already aggregated on those things. Those people want to play games, and you just create a games layer on top of an existing user aggregation. So I think that's fundamental in the success of Tencent in the games business. They're the largest video game publisher in the world by revenue. They are an obvious and important example of that, take existing aggregation of users and make them game users.But almost all of the other ones that we've seen have come from using a piece of must have hit driven content to seed the aggregation. I can't think of an example where that hasn't been the case, where it hasn't been driven by a piece of content. And we shouldn't find that, that weird. Look at what Disney is doing in the streaming space. They're taking their Star Wars assets, their Marvel assets, et cetera, must have content, must see TV basically, and they're aggregating it together on a platform and it's the honey pot that's pulling users in. Investors have historically looked at that, wow, you need a hit game in order to build that aggregation and to see that as something somehow negative, that there's something wrong with that paradigm, I actually think it's very natural and I see it in other entertainment industries as well. It doesn't seem that weird to me that content is the pull that creates the initial aggregation. Patrick: From having been such an intimate part, an early investor in Riot, the business, over time. What do you think Riot can most teach non-gaming businesses about business in general? Mitch: One of the key insights that Riot made early on was super service of their community. They got into their community early. The founders were present in the online communities. They did a lot of work listening to their consumers. And again, I don't think there's anything particularly novel about this. They really listened to what their consumers were telling them about their product, what their users were telling them, and they designed specifically to those requirements. I saw that as well with Discord, a company that I was lucky enough to invest in when it wasn't even Discord, and to help pivot to the platform that it is today, with all the success that it's had.But very early on, we were on Reddit. The founders were in there and they were having a dialogue with their audience. What is it that's going to make this more interesting to you? What is it that you don't like about it? And all businesses can benefit from that. Again, I don't think it's particularly insightful, but it was a key element and it required a lot of investment by the founding team to really get in there and hear both the good things and the bad things about their product. Patrick: You said early on that we've moved from the original publisher model to the more platform based model, but also from the shiny disc to the instant download and the much lower cost of goods for delivering games. With that in mind, talk about the way that monetization has changed over that time, both in terms of dollars and in terms of margin. Because one of the things you said to me early on is, ""Do you imagine everyone's buying the same $60 disc? The person that loves that game the absolute most is paying the same as someone that tries it for five minutes and quits."" That's very different than the modern free to play world where you can have a much bigger demand curve if you will. And you monetize users at very different levels and very different business models. So maybe talk us through that evolution of how much people pay, how they pay and the margins that result from that in the gaming business. Mitch: This is, in my opinion, the key insight for understanding the modern games business, this change from an inelastic pricing model to an elastic pricing model. I'm a big soccer nut, and I'm going to, every year go to Target or Best Buy or whatever, and buy a copy of FIFA from Electronic Arts. And I'm going to put it in my PlayStation 5 or my Xbox, and I'm going to play it for a zillion hours. In the meantime, this has changed a little bit recently because Electronic Arts and some of the other console publishers have gotten hip to the idea of downloadable content and ways to monetize people like me outside of that initial purchase. But historically, that was it. You got my 60 bucks and that was all you were going to get from me. Meanwhile, my friend down the street goes to the same store, buys the same disc for $60, plays it for 10 hours, sticks it in a sock drawer and they're done. Yet, essentially, Electronic Arts has basically treated us as if we were identical users. And I think starting in 2005 with some early games out of Nexon, KartRider out of Korea, a game that people inside the games industry recognize as being one of the most influential products of all time, but people outside the industry haven't really paid that much attention to it, or don't even really know about it. It was basically a Mario Kart like cartoony racing game, where the company gave the entire game away for free. It's not like shareware, where you get three levels and then you have to unlock to continue to play it. It wasn't crippleware.It wasn't any of these earlier paradigms. It was the whole enchilada. You got the entire game for free. And the way they monetized was they would sell you cosmetic items and other things to enhance your experience, to give you status within the world, other things like that. And it was a massive success and it proved to the industry that you could use this giving the game away for free, which is one of the great marketing advantages of all time, when you can basically say to your consumer, ""Hey, you don't have to pay me and you can have every good part about this product,"" and push the monetization downstream to a point where you've already hooked these people into the experience. And then, you can monetize them in an elastic manner. So the 10 hour person that we talked about earlier is going to pay you potentially or not pay you as the case may be. But me, the thousand hour person is going to pay you insane amounts of money and thus the rise of the modern whale. If you want to talk later about what's happening in the advertising business and the customer acquisition business right now with Apple and Facebook wars that are going on because it's having a devastating effect on that part of the video game business. That is a hugely important maneuver in the video game business.And again, it's something that, when Riot games pitched us at Benchmark, initially the concept of doing a game for the core... League of Legends is not a casual product. League of Legends is a hardcore product. The concept of using the KartRider monetization method, which is give the whole game away for free and then virtual goods, virtual items to cosmetic items to new characters, et cetera, downstream was really radical. There was a very strong sense at the time that, okay, yeah, it's going to work in casual, but it's never going to work in the core. The core is just going to abhor the concept of not getting everything and not paying up front, et cetera. And of course, they were completely wrong, and League of Legends went on to generate $1 billion a year in revenue for a decade, one of the most successful video games, if not the most successful video game in history. Patrick: Especially early on with something like League of Legends, how in the world, in this new paradigm, do you begin to understand the economic model of the business? Because $60, I can get my head around that, but it seems like it would be really hard to know, is the super fan going to spend $100? Are they going to spend $1,000? Are they going to spend $100,000? And the difference between those probably makes or breaks some of these business models. How did you start to gain an understanding of the dynamics of this whale curve, I'll call it, where so much of the economics of the business depends on such a small percentage of the actual customers? Seems like a really hard business to model or even get your head around conceptually early on in these businesses or early on in the games. Mitch: You're absolutely right. And in my experience, it has led me to build in a period of monetization experimentation in that first year after launch. And my expectations for some of these games is when they come out, they'll be relatively flat for the first 6, 9, 12 months while the team is really digging into what is working. The monetization hooks that are in the game, which ones are succeeding and which ones are not? So for example, in the League of Legends context, an early surprising thing that was heavily monetizing were these potions that allowed for multiplying your grind. So for example, if you were trying to gain experience points, you could go in, if you played for 10 hours, you'd get 10 experience points for those 10 hours. But there are people who have jobs, who have lives, who have families, who can't go in and grind for 10 hours and so we would sell them a potion where if they would buy the potion and apply it, if they went in and did the grind for two hours, they could get 10 hours worth of credit.This was very important because you still had to grind. So there wasn't a pay-to-win component to this and pay-to-win is something that can massively disrupt the community around the video game and something that gamers hate. So the 10 hour grinder could say, ""Look, the lawyer who's going to come in and grind for two hours, but pay for the 10 hour grind, you know what, they're still grinding for two hours so there's a degree of fairness to this."" And those products were extremely popular early on with the community. We could foreground those a little bit more. I have a portfolio company in Los Angeles called that game company run by Jenova Chen. The company is just crushing it. They have been over the last year, at times, the number four product by revenue in China, which is no small thing. This is a company doing hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue and nine digit EBITDA. And it took us a year to figure out how to monetize it properly. Patrick: Fascinating. What is great in people that are good at that sort of experimentation? Does it come from an understanding of user psychology and behavior? Is it just more quantitative, spam a lot of tests and see what works? Is it art? Is it science? Is it some combination? Mitch: I think it's more art than science in the sense that the most successful strategies tend to be the ones that are the most integrated with the design of the game, that adhere the most closely to the ethos of the game. I don't have any privileged knowledge here, but in my experience, it's a design first informed by the quant rather than a quant first, design second.",2627
18,Mitch Lasky - The Business of Gaming,"The Role of Platforms, Mobile Gaming, and VR"," Patrick: I'd love to talk about the role of the interactive platform. Being used to play a game. I grew up as a PC gamer and played some of the PlayStation and Xbox stuff too. But those were clear the dominant. Then obviously mobile came along. And those are probably the three major dominant today. And then, also thinking to the future of VR or AR, other kinds of platforms where people might engage with these games, what has the shift between platforms done to the business model? What should we know about the impact that mobile has on the gaming business itself versus prior platforms? Mitch: Just to lay the groundwork, current business, probably 180, 190 billion worldwide. It's about 50% to 55% mobile in terms of revenue, which is very surprising to most people who've come from the historical games business. When they actually drill into the numbers, if they're not aware of it, mobile is the dominant paradigm in gaming right now. Console and PC split the remaining half of the games business, roughly. PC's about 20%, console's about 25% of the remaining revenue. What is the influence of mobile? It's enormous in good ways and in bad ways. I have a long history in this business. I was making mobile games before the App Store, before iOS, when we were working on feature phones. Interestingly, a lot of successful people in the business, Ilkka at Supercell and a number of others came out of that world. Nokia, Motorola, we were making a bowling game on Motorola phones that did millions and millions of units. Very interesting, early signal of where mobile was headed.Mobile has really reinforced the move to free to play because obviously when 2,000 games are being launched in the App Store every month, it's impossible to get somebody to pay for anything up front. It's sort of a race to the bottom in that regard. It's accelerated the move to free to play tremendously. It's created a lot of interesting innovations around monetization strategies in conjunction with free to play. It's been a real laboratory for experimentation. On the negative side, it's brought out the worst in customer acquisition dark patterns, pushing people, pushing installs, incentivized installs. Some of the bullshit that we saw around social gaming back in the Zynga, Playfish days, mid-2000s, not my cup of tea. You've also seen a level of acquisition spending that by historical standards would seem anomalous. Back in the day, if we were spending 25% of expected revenues on advertising and promotion, that was a lot in the shiny disc era.I've had companies come in and pitch me that are on $100 million revenue run rate with a casino game. They're spending $92 million on customer acquisition. Crazy shit we would never have done. And those are dangerous models because, as Bill Gurley has argued, he's got a great post on Above the Crowd about the dangers of that customer acquisition, customer lifetime value model. When that stuff starts to fall over, it falls over really fast and really dramatically. I find those patterns to be very dangerous. That's why I've always gravitated towards products that have a much more organic distribution opportunity. Getting back to Jenova and Sky, that game company, they spend a tiny fraction of revenue on paid customer acquisition and almost all of it is being driven by community and word of mouth. Again, it's really highlighted the difference between those approaches. Patrick: You mentioned the big changes in the Facebook, Apple ad market targeting all this stuff and its impact on gaming. How would you summarize all that? It sounds like, especially for the casino companies spending 92%, it's catastrophic to their potential to continue to do what they were doing. But how has it changed the landscape so far? We've got a little bit of time since it happened now so we have some perspective. How would you sum it up? Mitch: It's really highlighted how reliant a lot of the mobile game business was on Facebook advertising and other forms of direct response advertising. The fact that you can't target whales and you can't target potential installers as well as you could when data was leaking everywhere off of these platforms. And again, I'm not averse to what Apple is doing here. There are potentially monopolistic issues with the way that they're doing it. And to the extent that they then step into the place of Facebook later with an advertising platform and replicate a lot of this stuff, but within their own walled garden, I'm not sure that's a great outcome for the market, but I'll keep those opinions to myself. We've seen, in companies that I've been following and that I'm aware of where I have some privileged access to data, installs are down between 10% on the good side and 35% on the bad side for some of these companies that are typically more in the aggregation business. Because those are the ones more reliant, typically, on this kind of paid advertising. Ones without a single product hit, they've been tremendously affected. As installs go down, you're obviously going to then see a knock on effect to where revenues are going to go down.And to the extent that these companies have been running their models based on certain spending translating into certain lifetime value, those models are going to have to be rewritten very fundamentally in order to account for this new reality. And I think we're going to see some really interesting new go to market approaches that aren't going to be as dependent on paid acquisition, which I think is fantastically good for the industry in the long run. I just invested in a business up in Canada, a really interesting new games company and they are taking a go-to-market approach for a game that's going to primarily monetize on mobile where they're going to use the PC SKU as a very interesting customer acquisition vehicle because it'll be available to Twitch streamers and other influencers who can use it to aggregate and to push demand toward the mobile SKU, which is where they're going to do the principle monetization. So I think it's a very exciting experiment in terms of a next generation approach to this problem. Patrick: I'd love to spend some time talking about the technology and tooling on both the demand and the supply side and the distribution side of the business, starting with the frictions to creating games in the first place. So I spent my morning messing around with Midjourney, the new image AI generating tool, which is really mind boggling. When you first engage with these tools, Dolly or other ones, it doesn't take a genius to start to extrapolate where this might go. Right now, it's images, maybe soon it's animations, maybe beyond that it's whole stories. It seems like technology is making the friction to taking what's in your head and getting it into the world lower and lower and lower. I'm curious how you think what I guess I'll call the democratization of the technology or access to the technology that might build games, we could talk about Unity and Unreal, et cetera, how that changes the supply picture here. Because I imagine to create a marque game from EA or something, it's like a movie. Crazy big budget, capital's a huge barrier to entry. Someone with a great idea isn't going to get anywhere without the big apparatus and fixed investment stuff. So how do you think all of that develops from here, the role that lower frictions and supply and how they'll impact the industry? Mitch: It's interesting to think about it akin to what's happened in the linear video world. 15, 20 years ago, to get a Panavision or an R-Flex camera on set was hundreds of thousands of dollars in terms of skilled labor and rental cost and lensing and all of these things. Obviously, it became a sport of kings and you and me couldn't go out on a weekend and shoot a low budget feature because we just couldn't get the tech. And to the extent that we could, we had to shoot it on film that had to be processed. And that was really expensive. And it had to be cut by hand.That was the old days. Now, Soderbergh shot a movie on an iPhone and put it into full commercial distribution with a thousand dollar device in your pocket and some very minor additions so you can really make something like that work. Now, does that mean that everybody can make a feature film? Absolutely not. Making a feature film is hard. It's a skill. It requires, in some cases, a lifetime of investment in learning to get there. And I think it's equivalent in the video game business. The existence of Unity, the Unreal Engine, these other technologies, which have really democratized access to the industry. Patrick: Roblox would be a good example. Mitch: Roblox, tremendous example. But making games is still really hard. More doesn't necessarily mean better in this case. I think it's great. And I think getting these tools into the hands of people who couldn't have, for whatever reason, for reasons of bias and lack of diversity, economic opportunity, or whatever, getting these tools into the hands of people who love and are passionate about games and can now make them, to realize those visions is a big deal. But it doesn't change the fact that making great games is a unique and difficult skill. Patrick: If you think about the step beyond mobile, do you think there is one. Everyone's been talking about AR and VR for a very long time. There have been some examples, but VR doesn't seem to have a game that's completely taken off yet. There doesn't seem to be real evidence that mobile is on its way out. What do you think happens beyond mobile or is the current lineup of console, PC, mobile, and its relative market share, probably a pretty mature and long lasting thing? Mitch: I was an early VR curmudgeon. I was cautioning the industry famously back at Casual Connect right around the time of what is now Meta, then Facebook's purchase of Oculus, that it will take a long time for VR to become a mass market phenomenon. I was an early mobile pioneer. I started a mobile games company in 2000. This is seven, eight years before the iPhone and 10 years before broad access to in-app purchase, which was really the catalyst for the mobile games business in a lot of ways. I'm a guy who's gotten out there and taken arrows on the frontier before. I was very cautious because I believe that the experience of VR, while visceral and primal in a lot of ways, you put on the headset, you're in the Jurassic World or wherever you are, there's something incredibly visceral about that. And I don't discount the power of the experience, but man, there are a lot of drawbacks to it like you're shielded from the rest of the world. You're in your own little environment. You're wearing these hot and heavy glasses on your head. The computational power of them is still pretty primitive. The graphical quality of them is still pretty primitive.I hate to say I was right, but boy was I right? They dumped 10 billion into this. They just announced a couple months ago they sold what 14, 15 million units of the Oculus. Some of these games are touting the fact that they have a million monthly active users. It's like, I've got games with a million concurrent users. It's really stillborn in a lot of ways. And again, there have been success stories. Rec Room, very interesting product, right? Beat saber, I would argue is probably the mist of virtual reality in the sense that it's selling one to one with the active user base. But when they're talking about, oh, there's 120 apps that have made a million dollars, well, you know what, at a $20 to $30 price point, that's like 30,000 to 50,000 units. That's failure. I'm not long VR in the short term. With that 10 billion investment, you see the results of it and it's horizon, it's a joke. It's just not compelling as a user experience. They're going to grind. They've obviously made a commitment to this and over time, maybe they're going to get it right. And maybe the Oculus 3 or the Oculus 4 is going to take off. But I wouldn't be, as an investor, lining up at the gates, getting ready to buy tickets on this ride. Patrick: I'm always interested in what I would call enabling technology platforms of any kind, and we just talked about how maybe VR hasn't shown up as that. But two that you've been involved with or know a lot about that I think certainly have are communication platforms like Twitch and Discord. How have those kinds of online platforms changed the gaming business, the gaming distribution model? Building games that are natively good to watch as a Twitch stream, seems like a thing. And these are side car technologies or platforms that seem to have massive importance now in the games that do well or don't. So what role do those platforms play in the world of games today because they seem like the opposite of VR. No one was touting these things like they might have touted VR, but yet here we are. They seem to have a huge influence. Mitch: In my opinion, YouTube in the first instance, and then Twitch later, are the most important non-game drivers of the gaming industry in the world. There's examples outside of the United States, in Korea and in China as well, that are analogs. But I'd argue that YouTube in the first instance where people started to upload gameplay and people started to watch it. I remember back early on StarCraft tournaments in Korea were being uploaded in native Korean and people were dubbing them and uploading them to YouTube. And geeky friends of mine were watching them like they were watching Friends on television. And I was like, ""This is the most boring thing. How are you finding this compelling in any way?"" And today I'm a big Age of Empires player. I'll watch Age of Empires for tournament games for an hour to see what their meta strategies are. So I've gone down that rabbit hole personally. That kicked things off. Minecraft is essentially a YouTube phenomenon. There are literally billions of views of Minecraft, historically, and millions of creators who are putting their stuff up there.And you think about the feedback loop, a kid goes on, watches other people playing the game. It's marketing. It's a level of customer acquisition that you couldn't buy if you tried. It would be prohibitively expensive in that regard. That started it, and then I got to see it up close and personal because Twitch and League of Legends launched contemporaneously. And so you saw a very interesting phenomenon where there were times early in Twitch's history where 50% of the streams were League of Legends. What you saw was this interesting upward spiral where the more people who would stream, the more people would watch it, they'd go download the game and start playing it. They'd start streaming. So it was like a two company network effect. Twitch benefited from the usage of League of Legends and League of Legends benefited from the usage of Twitch and they reinforced each other. And I think we've started to see that very broadly across the industry. Some of the more clever developers are actually incorporating Twitch as essentially a platform in their go to market.",3304
19,Mitch Lasky - The Business of Gaming,What Makes Games Endure," Patrick: Both those games you mentioned are probably in that category of what you called forever games. Now those games have been around forever. My son, who's eight, plays Minecraft all the time and I'm sure it was around before he was born. I'm really interested in what you've learned about the features of games that allow them to be forever games. Because if I think about the analogs you brought up earlier in the entertainment world, IP is amazing. You can keep milking the Star Wars or the Marvel or the whatever, but in some ways, it does feel like a bit of a depleting oil well. The marginal Marvel property is just not as good in the last several years. The marginal Star Wars one, in my opinion, the same thing. Whereas League of Legends seems pretty constant in terms of what it is as a thing and as popular as ever. So maybe this is the most valuable form of IP, because it doesn't require this constant rolling new stuff out that's drastically different. So what are those features that seems like if you could own any IP, it would be one of these forever games? What is common that allows for a game to be a forever game? Mitch: I have five attributes that I look for in these things. I'm not going to share them with you because I'm still an investor in this business and I like to not necessarily open the kimono completely. But I will share some things. So first of all, I think we have a somewhat distorted view of the longevity of games based on the games business. If you look back historically at very successful play patterns, they have incredibly long lifespans. You could have sat down with Leonardo DaVinci and played a credible game of chess. It hasn't changed that much since the 14th century. You'd have to teach him a couple of rules, but basically it's the same game. Backgammon is thousands of years old and it's still played pretty much in the same manner that it was played thousands of years ago. Even more modern examples, whist, which we think of today as contract bridge, is 400 years old. Poker is probably 150 years old. You could have sat down with a frontier cowboy in 1850s Kansas and played poker pretty much the same way you play poker today.Fun game play patterns are incredibly durable. The nature of consumption in the video game business has perverted our understanding of that. It's made us think that there's got to be massive turnover and innovation constantly. If you strip away the companies and the IP, and you really look at the play patterns, things like first person shooters, adventure games, massively multiplayer online role playing games, MMOs go back to the DikuMUDs that were invented in Copenhagen back in the early '90s. And frankly, they haven't changed that much. We're still using that same design pattern to create modern MMOs. So I think it starts with that, an incredibly durable, replayable design pattern. Community is an aspect of it. And the games that have survived the longest have the most vibrant and thriving communities built around them. There are definitely things you can look for when you're looking for a design that could be one of those forever games. Patrick: What are some of the signs in a healthy community since you brought that one up? What does a great versus good community look like? Mitch: Users ownership of the game, like sense of ownership, feeling that they are invested in the game at a really emotional level, sometimes represented by user generated content and that user generated content can either be inside the game. Things like Roblox has obviously a very robust system. Minecraft is probably the greatest example of this on the one hand. But it could also be outside the game. I think of Twitch streaming and linear video creation on YouTube as being user generated content as part of that same process.Those are really interesting signposts and important ones in terms of the viability of the community longer term. It's openness to new members, some of the worst communities are where you get these sort of independent grunge music type phenomenon where it's like, ""Oh no, no, no. I was here first."" And they try and pull the ladder up behind them around the community so it really bifurcates into early adopters. And then you get a sharks and minnows phenomenon that's unhealthy. Patrick: What has been the role of celebrity in all of this? I've always been interested in the last 10 years, let's say, in how new categories of celebrities drive outcomes in anything in the entire media category. I think it was Matt Kohler that first articulated this great idea to me. On a new content network, you want new celebrities to be minted and born and drive the growth of the platform, not existing or old celebrities. And I just love that concept. You've seen that happen with Clubhouse, for example, in the bad direction. What have you learned about the role of celebrity in gaming or influencers in gaming? Mitch: That's right. Trying to weld an existing celebrity into gaming, as a lot of people have tried to do, get Snoop to come and play your game on Twitch, they'll bring their audience with them, but that audience will leave when they leave. Those audiences aren't that useful and sticky in that way. I'm not in favor of that, but just look at the games business, the celebrities that it has created, guys like Mr. Beast or PewDiePie. Patrick: Biggest franchises in the world. Yeah. Mitch: Massive franchises. The number of views and the recognizability of those people is extraordinary. My son was a FIFA streamer when he was 13, 14, and had an interesting following on YouTube numbering in the hundreds of thousands to low millions. And we'd go to a mall and people would be like, ""Oh, hey, you're so and..."" Little kids would recognize him. It is a unique and interesting new form of celebrity. Patrick: One of the things we haven't talked about yet, which is shocking this far into our conversation on gaming, is the role that Web3 and maybe specifically NFTs will play in the gaming business model. So one of my favorite conversations from the last year that we recorded was with Gabe Leydon who started Machine Zone approached the upper limit of in-app monetization on average, which I think is $100 per transaction in Apple. And obviously, that limit has a huge impact on how things work. And then NFTs have this unlimited amount and Ethereum and other things represent a payment rail that allow you to push that unlimited amount very quickly with low friction. Do you think that that has the revolutionary potential impact on the LTV, on the gaming monetization model by no longer being limited to that $100 in-app purchase? Mitch: Yes I do. Although I am cautious like I was with virtual reality because I do believe that there is a degree of infrastructure that's necessary in order to make it transparent. Because I think in its current form where you're really foregrounding the crypto, you're foregrounding the Web3 stuff, and it's very obviously a key component of the gameplay experience. I don't think those things are going to necessarily scale. I admire a lot as a thinker, Blake Robbins, who I think you may also know- Patrick: Talked to him this morning. Mitch: He describes it as the three body problem, which is that in a classic video game environment, you have the developer and you have the user. It's a stable relationship. It can fluctuate. And power can go back and forth between the two of them. But when you introduce the Web3 stuff, you have now a speculator as the third body and three body problems are inherently unstable. And I don't think we've understood them at the level of design. Getting back to our earlier conversation about how the best monetization schemes are the most organic and almost invisible in terms of their relationship to the overall design and play experience.We haven't yet seen the Web3 games that have reached that level of success where the Web3 components are at a level of infrastructure and design that makes them almost transparent and invisible to the play experience. Somebody who has solved that three body problem of integrating the player, the developer, and the speculator in a coherent and mutually reinforcing way where they do not feel antagonistic. I have seen a lot of bad behavior thus far in the Web3 space with developers essentially using land sales, NFTs, et cetera, as an alternative to venture capital, which is very dangerous, in my opinion, and has the potential not to end well, although it does super serve that speculator in the three body problem. It may not be in the best interest of either the developer or the player at the end of the day. We've seen some instability with Axie over time. I was quite interested in how it was working out. I would say I'm long term optimistic, short term pessimistic. Patrick: Just to make sure I understand this problem, you've got this speculator whose interest is mostly buying stuff and seeing it go up versus buying it as a byproduct of playing a game they find pleasurable. Is that the right problem? And the solve that you've suggested is we need to find a way that there's an organic purchase in the game that's almost invisible. All that's really changed is now I can charge more than $100 for that. I can charge $10,000 or $100,000 for that. You just need to integrate the speculator as more of a gamer versus as a separate entity. Mitch: I believe that the successful product is going to create a gamification experience. I hate that word, but I'm going to use it anyway. A gamification experience around the speculator, such that their sole motivation isn't growth and essentially the Ponzi scheme of bringing more people in at the bottom so that it pushes the top up higher and higher and therefore over rewarding early speculators to the detriment of later speculators. And I don't believe that that's been successfully done. Again, I would suggest that there are examples of this happening in other non-Web3 games that I am shocked that Web3 developers are not paying attention to. So for example, EVE Online, famous game, one of the forever games from CCP in Iceland, that's been running forever, has many of the attributes of a Web3 game. It does have essentially a free economy to a large degree.There's a little bit of an invisible hand that the developer uses to steer things, but by and large, they kind of let it go. Man, has it been dynamic? It's unbelievably interesting what has happened in the context of that game over the last decade or so. And I think that that is highly worthy of study. I would really suggest, for example, the online poker boom before they ran into legal trouble and everybody ended up offshore. There was a lot of really interesting insight into how having sharks and minnows and skill and real money disrupts and perverts the play experience. But at the same time also enhances the play experience, like deepens the emotion. When I'm hearing these Web3 pitches, I'm not hearing a lot of that interesting insight from those approaches. They're looking at it very much Denuvo, and that is unfortunate because I do think that there are a lot of lessons from things that have happened in the games business historically, that are very, very applicable to the modern world. Patrick: What are those key categories of potential motivation that could replace the Ponzi motivation of getting more people in so the prices rise? Is it status signaling? Is that what a lot of this boils down to? Is it some sort of belonging to a community? What do you think are the core motivators that are not a Ponzi like motivator that could be tapped by the Web3 world that there's evidence from these earlier games? Mitch: One of the places where it's been actually quite interesting comes out of EVE Online where they created these concentric circles of moderation, where if you were new and you were in the main zone and you were preyed upon by a super user, a shark, there was a security mechanism in place that protected you to some extent. But then at the fringes of the game were these places called null space, nullsec. And nullsec had no security and it was complete free fire zone. You had a built in meta gamer, elder game where the more experienced users could migrate out to these spaces and they had a very different play experience.And in a lot of ways, it was much more of a user generated play experience. They were much more in control of the game. Building a game where there are roles like that, where there is a play role, an important one for the person, let's say in EVE, who runs the corporation that essentially handles the coalition of dozens or hundreds of planets and fleets, armadas that can go out into space and deal death, that's a really important role for a ""speculator"". And something that really integrates them into the community and the play experience in a way where just owning an effing NFT really does it. And I think that's the danger, is that you create this bifurcation where the people that own the NFTs have a motivation that has nothing to do with the play experience.",2936
20,Mitch Lasky - The Business of Gaming,The Potential Future State of Gaming," Patrick: Yeah. It's a completely fascinating insight. It also makes me wonder a bit about everything you've read about metaverse and more scaled up versions of these online universes. I've talked before to Matt Ball and others about the technology limitations on the metaverse. And like you said, with Oculus, over time, these things will get better as technology improves. But what do you think about contrasting League of Legends, which almost feels like a modern chess, the way it's balanced, versus the Ready Player One, Persistent Universe that people go spend all their time in where Web3 seems like it would make a lot more sense because you have this persistence. You have this world that you inhabit versus a game you play every so often. So what do you think about that transition to more Persistent Universes that are bigger in scope with more concurrent players and all of that? Because it seems like a very hyped up potential future. Mitch: Without being too dismissive, I think it's a bit of a boy's fantasy. I don't think it is an accident that the three major periods of virtual reality investment and innovation coincided with the publishing of three key novels, Neuromancer back in the '80s from William Gibson, Snow Crash from Neal Stephenson, and then Ready Player One. They were almost identical in time to the publications of those books. And so I do believe that this concept of VR haptics, immersion, transacting in this three dimensional, metaversal kind of environment, it has attributes of a boy's fantasy to me that bothers me a little bit. And in some sense, I really believe that I already live in the metaverse. I'm talking to you, I'm seeing you, I'm hearing you, we're interacting in, and we're not present. We're present in a virtual world. Okay, it's not a 3D virtual world. You're not represented as an avatar. I won't feel your touch on my hand if I shake hands with you in the virtual world through my haptic glove, but who cares on a certain level?People still read books. It's a very low bandwidth activity, but you can conjure worlds in your mind through something as simple as reading text. I do not believe that we need to get to this end state of fully immersive virtual reality and haptics in order to make these virtual experiences happen. The harder question is another subset of that question you asked, which is integration. In order to make these things work, we have to agree on protocols, which are going to allow us to interoperate. That is a massively non-trivial problem. Tim Sweeney has tweeted snarly about it, the CEO of Epic, which is this concept, which I've heard glibly from a bunch of these metaverse proponents where it's like, ""Oh, you're going to buy a gun in Fortnite and you're going to shoot it in Call of Duty. It's like, ""Hell no. Do you know how hard that is to pull off at the level of code."" I saw Andreesen Horowitz just dumped 50 mill into a cross-platform avatar creation company. And as seemingly ludicrous, as that sounds on the surface, that may work.I could imagine avatars being the first layer that gets protocolized, if you will. Being able to take currency that you've mined in one game and spend it in another game is going to require a level of trust and it's going to make the international monetary system seem like child's play. How are you going to translate those experiences? What is a dollar of Call of Duty money worth in Fortnite? We haven't even really crossed these bridges intellectually, let alone coded them. We've got a lot of work to do before some of these kinds of fantasies are realized. And I think Meta's strategy is we're going to make it happen within the context of a walled garden. Now, they obviously have business reasons for pushing it in that direction, watching the Apple example and seeing how the hardware, software integration and platform integration creates the largest company in the history of mankind. And I would be looking at that hungrily as well if I were them. However, I think it is a much bigger problem than people are really thinking. Patrick: Having thrown, I think, a sufficient amount of cold water on some of the most hyped up trends, whether that be Metaverse, Web3, VR, et cetera, are there any emerging technologies, trends that you are watching very closely that you think could have the sort of impact that something like a Twitch has had or something like an Unreal Engine has had to this point? Are there things at the frontier that you have your eye on? Mitch: The short answer is no in the short term. A more nuanced answer is that what Niantic was able to do with Pokemon Go was very interesting in a number of ways that I don't think have been sufficiently studied. Obviously, the pandemic and people's inability to associate in the real world put a real damper on the whole concept of location based entertainment. But that summer was really cool in a lot of ways when Pokemon Go came out. And I do think it was unique and obviously they haven't been able to replicate the success of that initial product. People underestimate the power of the first Nintendo intellectual property on consumer mobile. Nintendo's always been extremely proprietary about keeping their intellectual property linked to their own hardware. And this was one of the first times they freed some of their intellectual property to a mass market platform like the iPhone or the Android phones.And that is underestimated in terms of its success, but nevertheless, people were outside. It was summertime. The weather was good. There were a lot of interesting things that coalesced around that moment in time. And that suggested that there's something there. I do feel like there is something there and particularly post pandemic, hopefully, at some point we get there, where people are able to go back and associate in crowds again, we will see newer, more interesting forms of these location based, online to offline experiences. Because I do think that there is a lot to be had there and whether or not it's mediated by augmented reality hardware or not. And I think the phone, as we've seen with Snap, for example, they do a pretty good job of augmented reality with filters and other things like that on your mobile phone screen. So I don't think it's necessary that you're going to need goggles of some sort to mediate this experience. But I do feel like those location based entertainment products are a potentially underinvested category. Patrick: Do you think we see even more consolidation of distribution? And I'm thinking here about Microsoft Game Pass, which seems like a really interesting thing that has happened, the ability to access tons of games through a subscription that's annual, that for Microsoft at least, seems much more software like than the hardware of Xbox. It seems like a really interesting business decision on their part. What have you learned from watching that and what implications does it have on distribution and centers of power? Mitch: Dude, I could go for another hour on the genius of Phil Spencer, one of the smartest and most ambitious and experimental business leaders in the video game business. And I'm kind of in awe of some of the things he's been able to do at a company like Microsoft, that it's difficult to make those kinds of innovations when there's a lot of water under the bridge with Xbox and DirectX and Windows and all these other things. But his ability to virtualize the Xbox as a platform rather than as a hardware appliance is one of the underappreciated business moves in the history of the video game business. And I'm a Game Pass subscriber. I love the experience. It's made me download and play games I would never have considered buying before and frankly would not have even considered seeking out independently to download on a free to play basis because they are in front of me. The PC version of that Xbox experience comes up for me when I launch it. And it offers me this carousel of games that I could potentially play right now.And I think it's been very successful for them actually internally. And I do think it's extremely innovative, bringing that Netflix like experience with a single monthly subscription, enabling all of these products. Now, whether or not the rhythms of the games business, particularly the core games business... In the mobile business, I think it could be a little bit more amenable in the sense that there is a pattern of usage where people download a lot of content and churn through it pretty quickly. I don't know if you've ever watched your kids go and download games on mobile. They'll download 10 things, play them for 15 seconds and be like, ""Okay, this sucks,"" and they move on to the next one. The PC gaming experience is a little bit more high investment, high learning curve. It's not quite as, eat the next potato chip, as watching Netflix where you're constantly moving on to the next thing you're binging. But that said, I found it highly valuable, personally. And I really do think it's one of the more interesting new distribution innovations that we've seen. Patrick: If you think about every game you've ever played, is there a single design/play pattern, as you call it, that stands out in your mind as the most genius? Is there a single one or couple that you think are just pure art? Mitch: We talked about a little bit earlier, the DikuMUD is probably one of those patterns that has spawned so many games that you've played and loved and never been aware of the fact that they were almost directly influenced, and in many cases, subtle clones of that play pattern. I think that is probably the most important play pattern in the history of the video game business. I would argue maybe even more important than the console platformer, which obviously had an incredible life during the heyday of the console. You don't see it as much anymore. Patrick: And what is that play pattern, that DikuMUD, how would you describe what that play pattern is? Mitch: It's the hack and slash role playing concept, where you have character classes. You have attributes where experience is invested in enhancing character through that, where there's combat, there's inventory, these things that you imagine as being modern RPGs, are direct descendants of that play pattern. I don't know if you're familiar with Raph Koster, a genius game designer, one of the original designers of Ultima online and a real pioneer in a lot of these concepts that we've been discussing today. He's currently running a company in San Diego that's creating a next gen MMO. That's going to be something I'm very much looking forward to playing when it comes to market.He's got a brilliant presentation that he did at an online conference of the history of genre. And he goes into some of these things in great detail. As a gamer, I'm super interested in this. As a business person, less so. I don't think there's a lot that's flowed from a deep understanding of the history of genre in terms of success in the business. But as a player, it's a fascinating presentation. And he goes through the slide deck where he really shows the family tree of all of games that you love and what original design patterns spawn them. Patrick: Yeah. I cannot wait to get my hands on that. Is that publicly available? Mitch: Oh, absolutely. Yeah. It's worth looking for.",2510
21,Mitch Lasky - The Business of Gaming,Key Attributes for Investing Success," Patrick: Going all the way back to where we began, as we wind down our conversation, thinking about relative lack of game focused investors, I know there are some firms that just do this and probably do it really well. If you think about what might make the great PMs or GP investors in games specifically over the next couple of decades, do you think it's a lot different than what might have made a success in the last couple of decades? Obviously, Blake is someone I think that could do this extremely well. And I met a few others, but not many. What do you think are the attributes for anyone listening that wants to be this that are important to do well as an investor over the next decade or two? Mitch: The last generation, me and Bing Gordon generation of games investors, we were senior executives in the video game business. I mean, I was a section 16 executive in Activision. Electronic Arts had a very successful startup that went public, being obviously a legend, the founder of Electronic Arts, an incredibly important figure. And it took almost that level of credibility to pull this off. Bing and I, Bing's a little older than me, but not that much, I was in my teens when the first video game consoles started appearing. I was already kind of old when the video game business happened. This new generation, you look at someone like Blake, I was publishing Quake 3: Arena when he was born. He's just grown up soaking in this environment.They come to the table with an understanding of gaming that is profound. This next generation of games people, you do see just finishing school, burnishing of their reputation, people who've been associated with Riot, people who've been associated with Epic, et cetera, who are spinning out, typically people who are on the biz dev side or occasionally on the creative side. I do worry a little bit that some of the next gen investors that I'm familiar with and that I interact with, don't come as much from the creative side or the publishing side of the business, but they do come more from the deal side of the business.I have found, at least personally in my own evaluation of games investments, having those creative chops, having been a creative executive and having had to make green light decisions over product is incredibly valuable in evaluating the possibilities that are engendered by some of these potential games investments. I would encourage more people from the creative side of the business to think about getting into professional investing, because I do think that they would have a bit of a competitive advantage. Patrick: You've had and developed insane domain expertise and knowledge in an industry that you've always had a passion for and therefore done really well in, in lots of ways as an executive, as an investor. How well do you think some of that translates for you personally, to investing outside of gaming? You've invested in companies like Snap and Discord, been a very early board member and investor in places like that. Do you think you are a great investor outside of gaming? And if so, why? What translates from the obvious edge you have in gaming into more generic investing? Mitch: I challenge a little bit that I'm actually even a good investor in games. But regardless, this is a tough business, the venture business. When I was coming into it originally, I looked at it from outside and I thought, ""How hard could it be?"" The answer is, extremely hard. It's not hard, I think, to be like a broken clock, occasionally right. But to deliver returns consistently across a decade or more is a really hard thing in the venture business. And I'm still learning how to do it, frankly. I've been doing it for 15 years and I still feel kind of like an amateur. I'm not sure that it has translated.The only thing that I would say in that regard that is interesting is paraphrasing Andreessen's, ""Software is eating the world,"" thing. I think games are eating the world in a certain way too. And a lot of online experiences, in particular, community experiences, social networking experiences, a lot of consumer internet and mobile are learning things from the kinds of things we've learned in games over the years, in the Web3 space in particular. Virtual economies and some of these other attributes of games, investments, I think are now more broadly applicable to consumer investing than perhaps they've ever been. I'm not sure that it necessarily gives me any kind of competitive advantage at all in any way. But I do believe that it is curious that game thinking, to put it broadly, is much more applicable across consumer investing than it's ever been. Patrick: Taking Discord and Snap as two that I know decently well, both seem to have this aesthetic appreciation, certainly Snap does to an extreme degree, that you talked about earlier in terms of the way you might evaluate a gaming investment, is this taste like thing? Do you find yourself applying that same lens on non-gaming companies and investments and what's that like? Mitch: Absolutely I do because I do think about that as a competitive advantage. A lot of times, the better designed products win longer term. I do think that a lot of those things: look, feel, repetition of action, how fast you can get to the things you really want to find, are key. And those things are things that we think about a lot in designing games. Those things are applicable and they are things that I do look for. But again, a lot of those products are much more amenable to a quantitative approach, looking at cohorts and retention and activity. To give you an example, when I invested in League of Legends, there were maybe 20 people in the company and they had a wire frame. They had nothing playable. They had no metrics. They had nothing. I went in and Brandon and Mark had a background that wasn't necessarily the kind of background I look for in games' founders, number one. Number two, they'd never made a game before. Number three, they'd never made a game with the team they had assembled before.In my experience as a publisher, having published hundreds of games, these would've all been huge red flags. I went into the meeting thinking, ""Okay, this is a courtesy meeting and 15 minutes, I'm out of here."" 15 minutes into the meeting, I was thinking, ""Jesus Christ, I am going to do this. I'm going to invest in this company. These people are so compelling. They are going to die to make this product and they know exactly what they're doing and they're able to answer all of my questions and anticipate my questions in ways that I couldn't have even imagined."" I was like, ""Bring me Steve Snow,"" who at the time was their executive producer, because I was like, ""I need to talk to the guy who actually knows how to make a game."" I want to spend an hour with Steve and I spent some time with him and he convinced me that these guys had their head screwed on straight. And I was like, boom and I green lit the investment and it obviously has gone on to be an extremely important and successful company. I don't know if that answers your question in any way. It's indicative of the way I think about it. Patrick: Is there anything that we have not talked about, especially in gaming, but just more generally about the world that you think is really important or interesting? Mitch: I think we've covered it. This has been the deepest dive I think I've ever done in a conversation with someone. I don't usually go this deep. Patrick: I love it. Well, let me close by asking my traditional closing question that I ask of everybody. What is the kindest thing that anyone's ever done for you? Mitch: When I first started working at Activision in 1995, well, I'd been a lawyer, not a very good one, but I had entered the video game business through that door because I had done some work at the Walt Disney Company when they were making their transition to digital. And so I had learned a lot about that business. I knew very little about business and I knew even less about the video game business when I arrived at the company. And Brian Kelly, who was the chief financial officer at the time, saw a diamond in the rough, I think.And in the first year that I was there, went out of his way to sit down with me and just talked to me about the business, impart his philosophy of the business to me. And to this day, I can still hear him sitting on my shoulder, whispering in my ear when I think about things in the business. And that was way beyond the call of duty, no pun intended. It would've been really easy for him to have let me sink or swim. But his willingness to invest in me intellectually was probably the kindest thing anybody's ever done for me in business. Patrick: Love that story. And I've loved our conversation today. I looked at my notes before today's call and saw that it was early 2021 when you and I first started talking about all these big ideas and these themes. I don't know of anyone that's as encyclopedic on the history of this industry as you. And it's been really fun for me, through you, to learn so much about how all this stuff works, not just from the gaming perspective, but from the business model of gaming perspective. So I'm really appreciative of your time today, but more generally of your time over the last couple of years, helping me get up to speed on what is, I think, one of the more interesting industries out there. So Mitch, thanks so much. Mitch: Thank you. It's been fascinating and you're the best interviewer. I always love talking to you. Thank you.This site uses cookies to improve your browsing experience.

22,David Senra - Passion & Pain,Introduction," Patrick: My guest today is David Senra. David has studied history's great founders and entrepreneurs in more depth than anyone I've ever met, and I'd wager, more than anyone else alive. In this conversation, we cover many of the most common themes he's discovered studying hundreds of entrepreneurs like Estee Lauder, John Rockefeller, Enzo Ferrari, and Edwin Land. I found this to be one of the most energizing conversations I've had in a long time and one I'll return to often. David's work and extraordinary energy aligns so well with our mission at Colossus, that we're excited to partner with him. You'll soon be able to find his podcasts and transcripts at joincolossus.com, where we hope you'll learn as much from him as we have. If you like this conversation, be sure to subscribe to David's podcast called Founder's podcast, linked in our show notes. Now onto our discussion. Please enjoy this great conversation with David Senra.",212
23,David Senra - Passion & Pain,How David Fell in Love With Reading and Biographies," Patrick: David, I think you have one of the most interesting hobbies turned professions of anyone I know. I first stumbled upon your show, I think because five friends at once told me to listen to the episodes on Edwin Land and Estee Lauder, those were my gateway drugs into your way of looking at history. I'd love to begin to introduce you to the audience by just outlining what you do. It's quite unusual, you've done a lot of it. Maybe you could just begin all the way back to when you first remember falling in love with reading, let's start there. David: I've been in love with reading longer than I even have a memory. A few years ago, unfortunately, my mother died of breast cancer at a young age. And as she was dying, because my parents had a tumultuous relationship at the beginning of my life, she's really the only one that has any kind of recollection of how I was as a child. So unfortunately, when she died, all those memories died with her. She said, the way you are now, you were from the time that you could talk. She's like, ""You would read anything you could get your hands on. Even if we didn't have books in the house, you'd read the back of cereal boxes.""She says something where she's like, ""We didn't have a lot of money, but what I would do is take you to the bookstore."" And God bless bookstores where, even to this day, you can go in there and even if you don't buy anything, you just sit on the floor and you can read. And that's one of my only memories from childhood, her taking me to the bookstore and just letting me read. And even before I could read, one of my favorite books when I was a real young kid was Where's Waldo?, that's not even reading, that's just sitting there trying to find the guy with the striped hat. So it's just the only hobby that I've had my entire life. There's a ton of hobbies that I've picked up, a ton of interests, a ton of sports, all these kind of things where I'll get really intense, do it for a long time and then drop it. I have two modes, zero or a hundred.Reading's not like that, and I just reread, because the founder of Visa, Dee Hock, just passed away. And what I loved about his book is he was the exact same way. He grew up in a tiny house on the edge of the Rocky Mountains, had no plumbing, no electricity, no money. They barely had food, but he had books. His neighbors just said, ""There's something wrong with that Dee Hock boy, he'll read anything."" See when I read biography, it's like, I'm not reading biography casually. I'm not like, ""Oh, okay."" I put myself in the story. To me a great biography is like a movie for your mind, except instead of being over for two and a half hours, it's going to last 15, 20 hours.We were just talking before recording that I read a thousand page biography on Enzo Ferrari, one of history's greatest obsessives. You put yourself in that story. You're like, ""What is it like being a young Enzo Ferrari?"" His father passes away unexpectedly. Your 18 years old, your father that you love more than anything passes away. Your brother serving in World War II gets killed. Your father's business collapses because of your father's death, now you're left as an 18 year old man trying to support your mother with no skills, no education, no anything. That's where the ideas... And then when you study somebody like Enzo Ferrari, it's like, ""Oh, that is why the guy worked 16 hours a day, seven days a week for 60 years and did it until he died, because of that pressure.""One of the greatest stories in that book... He didn't even think he was going to start his on car company, it was just amazing. The big car company of the day in Italy was Fiat. He goes to try to get a job, and at the time there's this huge glut. This is after World War I, and all these veterans are looking for jobs so they get precedence over him. So he feels deflated. He had traveled from a small Italian town thinking he's going to get a job because he's obsessed with car racing because his dad used to take him to the races at nine years old. There's just so many things where you can't understand why they make the decisions they do in business, unless you understand who they were and what happened to him early on in life.What happened was, he goes and gets a job, he gets rejected, he goes to a park bench in the middle of the snow and is crying. It's a very vivid scene in the biography. And what is insane is 40 years later after Fiat buys half of Ferrari, he goes back to that bench. The author ties it together. He's like, ""There was a missing piece of my life, a problem that I hadn't solved that ate away from me that caused me to have this excessive drive and dedication and obsession to my business, and now that circle is complete."" And he goes and sits on that exact same bench. Patrick: The idea of understanding what happened to someone before they were 18 was the topic of a conversation I just had with one of the partners at Sequoia telling me a story about Mike Moritz, Sir Mike Moritz, a very famous investor, who asks that question of just about everyone, thinking that someone's motivation tends to be rooted in their life of childhood, maybe up until 14, not even 18. Before I start getting into your obsession with biographies, you mentioned your mom already, what is that for you? If we were to zoom in on your time pre-14, what's rooted in your own history that's made you this complete obsessive about studying history's great entrepreneurs and founders? David: I think there's a lot of examples in these books. Sometimes you learn what to do by seeing it done incorrectly. If I had to guess, and I don't even like thinking about this stuff, both sides of my family, they did the best they could, but my parents didn't even graduate high school, much less college. I'm the first person in my family to graduate high school, the first person to graduate college, the first male in my family not to go to prison in three generations. Both sides of my family, unfortunately, are filled with examples of what not to do. Usually it has to do with abusing children, sexual abuse, physical abuse, abandoning their kids. I had never met an intelligent person in my extended family.My immediate family did as best as they could. My dad's still alive, I still have a relationship with him. It is what it is. As you get older, and now I have my own kids, you start thinking all the stuff that you're mad at them about, imagine if you had their parents. One person in a family, I'm thinking of my grandmother and my dad's side is just an evil person, and then my grandfather on my mom's side, they destroy everything in their wake. My own guess is, why I was obsessed with books and stuff like that is, I was looking for the right answers because all I saw was the wrong answers. Ooh, I don't want to be that person.One of my favorite things Warren Buffett said, I've read his shareholder letters. I've read a bunch of biographies on him, then went and studied all the people he talks about in his shareholder letters, so I have 15 episodes. He says, ""Hey, go study this person, they're really smart."" And I'll go and track them down and then find out who they admire. But one of the best things he ever said, he's like, ""One of the best things ever happened to me is I picked the right heroes."" I think that is extremely important. So that is the role that books play for me. Is just, I don't have access to these people, I didn't have mentors. I didn't have anybody.When you think about what a biography is, you're getting to know somebody and they become mentors in a historical context. This is why Charlie Munger has such great advice and why he's read hundreds of biographies. He's like, ""I make friends with the eminent dead, because if you learn the ideas they have and the personality behind that idea, it's actually going to stick."" As opposed to just a list of, ""Hey, here's 10 good business ideas."" But if you actually understand why they did it the way they did, why did they think about that? Why were they obsessed like that? Why did they want to avoid other things?I've had publishers for books reach out to me, some of them had been subscribers to the podcast. They're like, ""You should write a book."" And I was just like, ""I can't simplify over four years, I'm up to 270 books, over a hundred thousand pages, over 10,000 hours."" If you look at what Founders is right now, it's around 400 hours of audio. That's about as short as I can get it. There's no book that I know of that's 400 hours long.I've been married. I've been with my wife for 15 years. And even recently she's like, ""I've never heard that story before."" How is that possible, I've talked to you every day for almost two decades? I don't know, I just try to focus on the future as much as possible. Everybody has weird unresolved things in their past and what I really like, the best feedback I've got on Founders, the podcast, is people find it comforting. The vast majority of people are not born in great circumstances. This is not new at all. It's not unique. It's the vast majority of human history have had to be born into and survive and thrive in imperfect situations. So when you hear that over and over and over again, and they worked their way through it, found a way out, it's hugely inspiring. Patrick: Do you remember the first time you connected with someone that you were reading about through this lens of a positive role model? Was there one that stands out in memory as the first in the category of biography? David: I have a series of heroes, and almost all the heroes have come through the podcast in the research I've done. Usually they're heroes in what they did, they got to the top of their profession. They had a lot of good ideas. They're very admirable. They're wicked smart. They don't give up. They have extremely high pain tolerance, but they're all imperfect human beings. And that is kind of the cautionary tale, the overall theme of Founders, where I get a lot of feedback too, I'm glad you're not idolizing these people. They're people, everybody's an imperfect human being, so I'll take bits and pieces from people.The only person out of every single person that I've studied on the podcast that I consider my blueprint for, I want that, I want their life in totality is Ed Thorp. Because, history's greatest entrepreneurs, how'd they get there, they're going to over optimize their work to the detriment of everything, their health. In many cases, they die earlier than they have to. They are terrible fathers. They're terrible husbands. I don't want to do that. They have no friends. They're crazy people. I keep bringing up Enzo Ferrari, somebody I greatly admire from a work perspective, worked seven days a week, 12 to 16 hours a day, 60 years till he died, he was a terrible husband. He was a good father, his son Dino actually dies early from, I think, muscular dystrophy when he was 20. But he had no friends, never traveled. Wouldn't leave his town. Wouldn't get on an airplane. Wouldn't even get on an elevator.So I look at it like, how can I be obsessive about the work I do, I want to make sure it's the highest quality it could possibly be, but not be terrible in all these other domains. If there was an entrepreneur that I could only read one of the books that I've read so far for Founders, it would be this book called Against the Odds an autobiography of James Dyson. James Dyson now is 75. He just recently wrote another autobiography, that biography's good. It's not comparable to him coming off of 14 years of intense struggle. He's writing the book, once he gets over that hump, at the time Dyson has one product, it's just the Cyclone vacuum. It's in one market. It's just in England. It's the fastest growing vacuum company in history. It's doing a couple hundred million a year. He owns a hundred percent of it.But what makes that book so great is it's all the climb. It's, my dad dies young, which is a really sad story in there. I had to learn how to raise myself from being 11 years old. He starts a bunch of businesses, gets screwed over by different partners. But from the time he rips apart that Hoover vacuum and is like, ""Why does the vacuum cleaner have a bag that breaks all the time? This doesn't make sense."" To the point that he has a working prototype from his own design that he owns a hundred percent of, is 14 years of intense struggle, 5,127 prototypes.So what I do is I'm going to reread that book for every 100 episodes. So I did it on episode 200, I think I did it on episode 25. So 300, will be that book again, 400 will be that book again. Because it's just the reminder... That's where most people are interested. When you read a biography, everybody wants to know the beginning. There's always a part of the biography after they're super rich and famous and they're donating a bunch of money and I'm glad they're doing all that, that's fundamentally not interesting. How many people can relate to that? But everybody can relate to, hey, I have a dream. This is what I want my life to be. Life is going to throw up all these barriers, so how do I navigate that maze to actually get to where I'm going? Everybody can relate to that.",3103
24,David Senra - Passion & Pain,The Importance of Obsession and Perspiration in Founders," Patrick: So you've read nearly 300 of these things, some you've reread multiple times. I wish people could see on video the crazy notes and highlights you take in all these things. It's hard to imagine there's a personal life that is reading and studying biographies and trying to piece together the lessons as intricately as you are, especially within a sub-category, which is Founders, not just business founders, but people that start things. And I understand that you can't compress down what you've done, the body of work to much smaller than it is, but I thought we could take today's conversation as an opportunity to just touch on a couple of the ideas that you and I have talked about as we've just discussed the body of your work. One of them is this, I guess the word is obsession. There seems to be as a through line through so many of these people, some initial, whether it's a vacuum cleaner or makeup or cameras or whatever the thing is, some obsession takes root in the people that you've studied and creates this motivation, this dogged motivation to just keep going through thick and thin. Maybe you can just talk a little bit about that word obsession, how often you see that characteristic, whether or not you think it's the key characteristic in the people that you've studied in terms of why they did what they did. David: Every single book. It's also the very high bar. Because think about that, to make it onto Founder's podcast, you've got to live a life so remarkable that somebody wrote a book about it. The tiniest of tiny subset of people, and they're all extreme people. Because I find freaks and crazy people and misfits and rebels fascinating, which is frustrating to me because there's four passions in my life, entrepreneurship, reading history and podcasts, so Founder sits in the middle of that. And for the life of me, I don't understand why so many business lectures, business books, business writing is boring. You have the most fascinating subject on the planet and then you have the most fascinating personality types. Think about how crazy you have to be to be like, ""Hey, this thing doesn't exist, I want it to exist and I'm going to will it into existence. And I'm willing to do everything possible to make sure this thing succeeds."" That is a crazy person. That is a tiny percentage of any of the people alive and the people that have lived forever.But I could scroll through, and I was doing that earlier, one thing I do is I don't only just make the podcast. I don't just read the book once, I take excessive amounts of highlights and then I store all my highlights in this app called Readwise, and I reread my highlights every day, because I don't want to forget the lessons. There's a limited amount of stuff that you are actually going to remember. So I also go through my episode list and I do that frequently. And I can't think of anybody that's not completely obsessed with what they're doing.A perfect example of this is, not only is one of the craziest stories in entrepreneurship history, but it's also one of the most fun books to read. It's called The Fish That Ate the Whale. It's this guy named Sam Zemurray. A ton of entrepreneurs and investors I know, all know this book. So I just recently reread it and it's just like, ""Okay, why is Sam Zemurray?"" This guy is super rich, at the time he's got the second largest banana company in the world and he's working in the fields in Honduras and he's with his machete and he's whacking away and he's crossing Honduras on a mule, the entire length of Honduras, looking for an advantage for his company while his competitors are sitting in an office building in Boston. And we know how the story ends, he kicks their because of course he is.But it's, why is that guy so obsessed? From the time he was 18 until he discovers what he called ripes, which is a banana that other banana companies would just throw away because you only have three or four days, maybe five days before it rots and it's useless. So there's a line in the book that's great. He made a calculation based off arrogance that he could be fast where others were slow. Why is an 18 year old penniless Russian immigrant in Alabama think that he can be faster, and he sees an opportunity that a giant company called United Fruit, which is one of the first, truly international American companies, why on earth does he think... They're super rich, they have all the assets in the world. They have the largest private Navy in the world. And this guy's like, ""Oh, I see an opportunity you don't see.""And it's because of this obsession. And he starts there, master's that. Then he starts moving up. Then he goes, ""Okay, I'll buy regular bananas. Okay, once I mastered that, now I will start buying my own ships. Then I'll go to Central America, United Fruits in Guatemala, I'll go next door. I'll go to Honduras and I'll start doing that."" And that's the entire story. So I don't think there's anybody that's going to write a biography of that is not obsessed. I do think, to answer your question, that is a fundamental trait, and in my personal opinion, it makes life worth living if you have that obsession. I could not live without an obsession. People are like, ""Oh, Founders is podcast, Founders is business."" Yeah, but it's an obsession first. It's an obsession disguised as a podcast in a business. Patrick: Is the thing underneath obsession mostly curiosity, because the topic of obsession for these people is all different. The Dyson one's a perfect example. It's hard to imagine getting excited about a vacuum cleaner, but he did. There's some reason behind the obsession each time, what is usually behind that? Is it just the basic system setting of curiosity in the person? And how do you think people listening should apply this obsessive lesson to their own lives? Do you think it's too general to say that everyone should keep working until they've become obsessed with something? David: I do think it's too general. I don't think most people will ever find it. The reason I'm so obsessed with just studying people that got to the top of their profession is because one third of your life is going to be spent working. Half of your conscious life, half of the time you're not asleep, is going to be spent working. For a certain personality type, to not Excel at that, not to be really good at that means that life is not going to be an enjoyable experience for me. If I had to guess, which comes up a lot, I think there's some kind of deep rooted fight against a sense of inferiority that is underneath it.It's interesting, this comes up a lot, there's a line in the Francis Ford Coppola biography that I read, because I really love reading biographies of filmmakers, that's the closest analogy to what I'm trying to do at podcasting. I read their words and I'm like, ""That's how I think about podcasting. That's fascinating."" And there's a line in the Francis Ford Coppola biography where, embedded in the story of the son is the story of the father. And his dad was this guy, he wanted to be a musician. He never made it, was super bitter. So he raised Francis Ford Coppola and they would just talk shit, his dad would just talk about anybody that was successful. And Francis is like, ""Well, I don't want to be the person criticizing the successful person, I want to be the successful person.""And Coppola, at the beginning of his career, look at his track record in the '70s. The decade of his 20s he's one genius move after another, movies that people still watch to this day and he had this fanatical obsession with learning everything about filmmaking, working every single hour, he'd fall asleep while editing films. And I think a lot of that came from how we started the conversation, some people have to say, ""Hey, I want to be like that guy."" Other people have, ""I don't want to be like that guy."" And those are equally powerful motivators.I think of Sam Walton, I just reread his fantastic autobiography, everybody knows about that, but rereading it over and over again, you see different things and then rereading... In between the first time I read it and the second time I read it, I read like 200 other biographies of entrepreneurs, so the words hadn't changed, but I changed. So the meaning changes.There's a time in that, way before he started Walmart, he's obsessed with retail, right? His little five and dime store is really successful. The guy that owns the building that he's renting from sees that and screws over Sam. And he's like, ""Oh, I'm not going to renew your lease."" And they're in a tiny town, a population of 5,000 people, so it's not like he could go across the street and open another one. So what he did is just took Sam's business from him, copied it, changed the name and put it in the same location. There is a scene in that book I've never forgotten where Sam is in his attorney's office trying to see if there's anything can do for it. And his attorney's going through the lease. He's like, ""No, you made a mistake. You didn't know any better. You're a young entrepreneur, but you didn't get the productions that it should have been in the lease agreement."" And Sam is sitting there and he's...Productions that should have been in the lease agreement. And Sam is standing there and he's clenching and unclenching his fists, and he's clenching and he's unclenching his fists. And he's clenching, he's unclenching his fists. He's like, ""I'm not whipped. I found this town, I found this store. I made this first success. I'll do it again."" And he just picks up. He's like, ""I'm not going to look back at this. I won't make that mistake again."" Goes to the next town, does it again. And does it again, again, and then two or three iterations after that, he stumbles on Walmart. So there's that thing where it's just like, I have this drive. And then, he talks about it in the book, unhappy life. His parents had a crappy relationship. Whatever it is that a kid experiences, I don't know if Sam could actually articulate it, because he's writing the book as he knows he's dying from cancer, but that drove him to just be obsessive.And he's like, ""I didn't like spending any time in the house. So I went out, I went to school, I worked as much as I could. And I was in every single club and accumulated every single skillset I have."" He had this weird drive, you either have it or you don't. My life is really interesting. And it's because of the podcast. With half my day is spent reading, having one-sided conversations with history's greatest entrepreneurs, which is what reading a biography and autobiography is. I get all these interesting ideas, see how they did life. And then the other half is, I get to talk to a bunch of founders and listen to founders. And then that becomes a huge friend group and I get to talk to all these really smart, interesting people.And I can't think of one person that needs somebody else to motivate them. There's something inside of them. That's why they're doing what they're doing. To be an investor, to be an entrepreneur, it doesn't work if you can't trust your own judgment. So what kind of person who's willing to take that risk? I know a ton of entrepreneurs that could even make more money, if they went to go work for Google or something like that. They'd rather make less money in their own business, than work for somebody else. But there is something bizarre that I don't think you can explain. All you can do is notice it in other people, and then seek those people out like, ""Oh, I'm not weird. There's a ton of people just like me."" Patrick: It brings to mind one of the things I was most excited to talk to you about, which is this classic nature/nurture debate in people, but it's the idea versus execution debate or the inspiration/perspiration debate. Famously, Edison said ""1% inspiration, 99% perspiration."" And maybe that's true in time, but what I found more recently is, good ideas matter a lot. If you don't have a good idea, all the perspiration in the world probably doesn't matter. I saw an interesting idea somewhere recently, which was, a lot of people can run a McDonald's franchise. Not a lot of people can create a new McDonald's. And I'm curious what you're reading of all these great entrepreneurs and founders, where it's led you in this debate of inspiration versus perspiration, and how you would assign what matters more or most? Obviously they both matter, but I would love to just hear you riff on these two twin concepts. David: So there's two guys I discovered through the podcast. One's Claude Shannon through Jimmy Soni's fantastic book, A Mind at Play. And another guy called Alfred Lee Loomis. There was a biography of him called Tuxedo Park. And what Shannon and Loomis had in common is, they wouldn't argue their ideas. I think a lot of entrepreneurs in general, they spend time on Twitter arguing about, should we be remote or should we be this? Or should we raise money? Or should we do that? Who gives a fuck? You have an idea and don't let anybody get in your way until it's done. And if that's inspiration or perspiration or whatever the case is, the idea obviously matters, because I think the largest predictor of business success is the market that you're operating in. This is all over Warren Buffet shareholder letters. It's in this book that I have right here about Henry Clay Frick, Andrew Carnegie's partner, and one of the greatest entrepreneurs to ever live.He benefited from the fact that he was monopolizing the Coke industry, Coke, not being Coca-Cola or cocaine, but Coke is this ingredient needed to make steel and iron. And he was at the right place in the right market. He was in Western Pennsylvania at the exact time he needed to be. And guess what? You take that dude, that's smart, that's disciplined and you put him in a market that's decreasing. You let him run Berkshire Hathaway, the original textile in the '60s. It's going to go right into the ground just like, you could be as smart and as hardworking. It doesn't matter. Instead of the idea, I think more of the market is way more important. One of the things I'm so excited about, why I'm obsessed, and me and you share this obsession. Which is, podcasting is a miracle to me. We were talking about the importance of understanding, why is this guy so freaking obsessed?Why is he working seven days a week on this? This is psychopathic behavior. It's because of the way I look at podcasting, I don't look at it as a means to an end. Podcasting is the printing press for the spoken word,. The revolution that Gutenberg unleashed when he invented the printing press, may have taken 40, 50 years, 60 years, 100 years to gain steam, even goes faster now, but that is exactly what podcasting is. Everybody's like, ""Oh, we have too many podcasts."" That's like saying you have too many movies. We have too many books. That's ridiculous. We have too many bad of anything, but there's always room when it comes to media or anything that people consume, for good things to grow and prosper. And to me, when I look at where do I want to spend all my time?Is there something I'm obsessed with, that I'll think about even when I'm not working? And then also, is it a growing market? You're telling me today, we've reached a peak of how many people are going to listen to podcasts? That's absurd, that's absurd. And not only will more people find your podcast and my podcast now. There's people that haven't even been born, that are going to be listening to episodes. I don't want to dismiss, is it idea or execution? You need both. I'm sure there are some markets where they're going to pull the product out of you no matter what. And if you're the only one in that market, then that market's going to be satisfied. But I can't think of anybody that I've read a biography about, that's just like, ""I stumbled into a good idea and I didn't have to execute relentlessly and over and over and over again for a long period of time.""That's another thing too, where I'm only interested in people that do things for a long period of time. There is a subset of people that can start a great business or be a great investor for two years, five years, 10 years. I'm interested in people that, you started the conversation saying about Edwin Land and Estee Lauder. Okay. Two obsessives. They both had good ideas and relentless execution. Estee Lauder had to wait 20 years. She got completely obsessed with the idea of beauty, didn't have the opportunity to start her company because she was a stay home mom, until she was 40.The reason I say, ""Listen, man, you guys should be reading Estee Lauder's autobiography"", is because it is my belief that if you were able to bring her back from the dead and let her start a company today, she'd be kicking most entrepreneurs ass, up and down the court, Edwin Land too. Edwin Land started working on what would become Polaroid when he was 19, and worked on it until he was 70. He had the third most patents in American history, behind Edison and I forgot the other person. Who the hell works on something from 19 to 70? That's incredible.",3954
25,David Senra - Passion & Pain,Why Great Leaders Put Ego Aside and Listen," Patrick: What about the people underneath these leaders? I probably listened to 50 episodes or something of founders. If I had to summarize one of the interesting lessons, is the dramatic importance of the individual. Which I think runs a little counter to maybe how a lot of people wish the world was, where if it was more communal and Steve Jobs was going to emerge if Steve Jobs particularly wasn't him, or I think the great individual theory or thesis, a lot of people don't like. But as I listen to a lot of your episodes and these stories, it strikes me that the person matters a lot. And I'm curious what you've learned about the layer of leadership underneath the founders, and if there's any common stories, themes, traits that you've sussed out there. David: I want to start with a quote, because you just nailed it. And I'm a Edwin Land fanboy. I am on a mission, because I meet a ton of smart people who don't even know who he is. So maybe people listening just don't know it, that he was Steve Jobs before Steve Jobs. Steve Jobs met him when he was in his 20s, Edwin was 70 years old. And Steve came over from the meeting saying, meeting Edwin Land was like visiting a shrine."" These ideas that you've undoubtedly heard from Steve Jobs, did not originate with him. He literally took them from Edwin Land. The idea of building a technology company at the intersection of technology and liberal arts. That's not Steve. That was on every single presentation that he made on Apple. He got that idea from Edwin Land. He literally talked about him over and over again. He said, ""This is my hero.""And Steve also had this deep historical knowledge, which all these founders definitely have, all of them. I have not come across a founder that was not curious about what the great people before them did. I actually made a 30 minute, in between episode. It's called Steve Jobs and His Heroes. And I break down 39 podcasts on either Steve Jobs or the people that he talked about influencing him. Even when he was young, he was in his 20's, and he could tell you how he felt the invention of the Macintosh was similar to Alexander Graham Bell's invention of the telephone. It's like, how the hell do you know that at that age? That's remarkable. But Edwin said that there's no such thing as group originality or group creativity. He goes, ""I do believe wholeheartedly in the individual capacity for greatness."" And he says, ""Originality are attributes of a single mind, not a group.""What happens is, even if you have a bunch of co-founders, there's usually one. A lot of these people had co-founders. You could say one A, one B, whatever the case is, but it's always singular. It's never a joint thing. And what's good is, they find people that can play the role of the second or third. It's not like, ""Hey, I want to be the smartest person in a company."" They all obsess. This is in Warren buffet, David Ogilvy, Enzo Ferrari, Steve Jobs. They only surround themselves with A players. There's a great book called In the Company of Giants. It's on the floor next to me right now. What's fascinating about that is, it's two Stanford MBA students in 1997, go and interview all these technology founders. If you think about the growth of technology industry from '97 until now, they were clearly ahead of time.And what's fascinating is, Steve Jobs, young Steve Jobs, he just came back to Apple, sits for the interview. They start the interview. They're like, ""Hey, startup founder doesn't have that much time to recruit."" And I forgot the exact terminology, but he cuts off. He's like, ""I disagree completely."" Recruiting talent is the most important job as a founder. Think about the first 10 people in your company. Every individual is 10% of the company. You don't transition from a startup, a nascent idea, to a super successful company that creates a great product, if you fuck up that part. That was his point that he was making there. And he knows that because, this is the crazy thing. So you mentioned Mike Moritz earlier, Mike Moritz wrote this fantastic book, the little kingdom. I read the updated version called the Return to the Little Kingdom. And what's fascinating about that is, that's way before Mike was an investor.It's the first, I think six years of the history of Apple. And when the book ends, the Apple 2's doing really well. Steve Jobs is still at the company, but we don't know how the story's going to end. So then I would read that book, and then what you need to jump into right after that, there's another book called Steve Jobs and the Next Big Thing. I think it was written by Randall Strauss. That book is about the 13 years between, he left Apple and then he returned. I call it bizzaro Steve Jobs, because it's a gifted, intelligent entrepreneur, making every wrong decision in the book. That book ends in '97, he gives this interview. Think about this, how crazy this is. He starts NeXT. One of his first 10 hires at NeXT is an interior designer for the office. What the hell is happening here?You're reading that book and you're like, ""I know Steve Jobs is smart. I know he is talented. How the hell did he do this?"" We talked a little bit about ego before we started recording, where it's very prone to let your ego get the best of you. People admire you because the work. What happens is, you usually isolate yourself. You'll work really hard. You'll do a lot of work. That work draws the attention of other people because it adds value to their life. And then suddenly, over time, you confuse us. It's like, ""Oh, they don't like the work. They like me. And then I could just show up without having to do the work and everything will be fine."" And at NeXT, he just showed up. He's like, ""I'm Steve Jobs. Patrick: Ego's such an interesting one. That lesson is fascinating. Confusing people liking the work for liking you. I've never heard it phrased that way. And that is so damn interesting. Where else do you see ego rear its head, good or bad? It strikes me that ego's a negative connotation. You don't want to have an ego, but you do want to be confident. You do want to be charismatic. You do want to be a good salesperson, some of the things that high ego people might be good at. What other things have you learned about ego? That phrasing is so helpful. David: I actually don't think that you build a great company with a giant ego. I don't think that exists. Sam Walton has a good idea about that. He's like, ""Listen, your ego should use to drive you, but you should not be on public display."" And he's like, ""I hire people at Walmart with big egos, that know how to hide it, because there is some weird thing where it drives you."" What's the problem is, when you make it apparent that you think that you're better than everybody else. In almost every story, you have a young entrepreneur that needs some help. They're usually helped by people that are older, have a lot more access to resources. So think about how people are funding private companies now. You have super smart and determined founders, a lot of potential. Who knows what a person like that is going to be in 10 or 20 years, but they need assistance.Whether it's they need resources, they need personnel, they need money. What I realized this morning is, there's this guy named Thomas Mellon and Thomas Mellon is one of the most important people in American business history, because he's the patriarch of the Mellon Family Dynasty. What he did is, he made a lot of money before and after the American Civil War. He's maybe 50 years old, super rich, owns a bunch of banks and stuff like that. He comes across a 21 year old Henry Clay Frick. Henry Clay Frick shows a lot of potential at this time. What Mellon can't possibly know yet, 40 years in the future, Frick is going to be considered one of the best entrepreneurs to ever do it. So much so that Andrew Carnegie sees him and is like, ""I need this guy on my team."" And then they have a falling out. There's a fantastic book called Meet You in Hell.I recommend everybody reads if you want to learn about Andrew Carnegie and Frick. It's about what Frick told him. They had a falling out. Later, when Andrew's about to die, he sends a letter to Frick. It's like, ""Hey, let's reconcile. We're living in the same city. We live a few blocks away. Let's get together."" And he writes back. He's like, ""I'll meet you in hell."" What was fascinating is, Mellon sees Frick. Frick is at the very beginning of building this Coke empire, that's eventually going to be acquired by Carnegie's company. And Mellon sees him. He's like, ""Oh, this is another me. This is me when I was younger."" He approves the loan. Then Frick takes that money, immediately deploys it, starts scaling up because he's like, ""Hey, I got an opportunity. I need to do this as fast as possible."" Goes back to Mellon, I think he borrowed $1000, this is in 1800.So it's a lot more money than $100 today. So he borrowed $100, goes back almost immediately, says, ""Give me $10,000."" Mellon's like, ""Yo, what the hell are you doing kid?"" So he sends one of his partners. He says, ""Go check out this Frick guy. He seems to have potential to me, but I need to make sure this guy's not full of crap."" So Mellon's partner goes and shadows Frick, and he writes back to Mellon and he's like, ""The guy works in the Coke plants all day long. Studies his books at night, knows his business down to the ground."" Make the loan. And that is the first hand up that he gets, that causes him to build a monopoly in his industry. There was no one B to Frick's Coke empire. It was clearly him. What was fascinating is, I didn't put this together the first time I read that book, because I probably read 150 books, 150 biography since I read it the first time.But I had just recently been rereading books on John D Rockefeller. And this guy named Jay Gold pops up in Rockefeller's biography, every single one, which is really weird. Everybody's read Titan, the most famous biography of johnny Rockefeller. What I did is, I went in the bibliography of Titan, found a book that the author, Ron Chernow, used as research and ordered it. It's a very old book. It's 40 something years old. It's very hard to find. I read that book and I'm like, ""Wait, this is a biography of Rockefeller, and this is an entire chapter is based on Jay Gold. What the hell is happening here?"" And then you see when people would ask, and Rockefeller is probably the most famous entrepreneur in history. And they asked him, ""Who's the best businessman you know?"" And he said, without hesitation, ""Jay Gold."" Without hesitation. Then you have Cornelius Vanderbilt. This is another thing we should talk about, is how all these people wind up knowing each other.There is something to be talking to other A players, and then you have cornea Vanderbilt who's the richest person in America at the time. 40 or 50 years older than Jay Gold. And he's like, ""Jay, Gold's the smartest person in America."" So I was like, ""Okay, what the hell happened?"" So the author actually sent me the book, a biography of Jay Gold, came in 15 years ago and I think it's called Dark Genius of Wall Street or something like that. These are formidable people saying, ""This is the one."" You got to pay attention to that. Why is that happening? So I'm reading Jay Gold's biography, same situation. He's 20 years old, 21, needs a leg up, meets this older, more successful businessman. But where Mellon did is I'm successful, but he didn't know his ego get in the way. He's like, ""I want to be this guy's partner. His success does not threaten me at all.""The difference between Jay Gold's life is, Jay Gold winds up taking on an older partner, this guy named Zadock Pratt, I think is his name. I'm going off memory here. So I might get his name wrong. But that guy was super rich, owned a ton of land in the Northeast at the time, owned 30 different factories that would produce leather goods. And all the different factories would have different partners. So he winds up doing a partnership. Jay winds up doing some surveying work for him on some of his land. And Zadock's like, ""Oh, this guy's smart. I'll partner with him. I'll put up the money. I'll give you the expertise. And then you run with it."" Well, Jay Gold is a straight up genius, way smarter than Ill ever be. And he runs with it. He'll hit you up for advice and money, but eventually he's like, ""Oh, I got this. I can figure it out.""He's coming up with ideas. The crazy thing about Jay is, this guy's been in the leather business for 40 years. I'm coming up with ideas that he doesn't see. That threatens Zadock's ego. How do I know it's Zadock's ego? Because the guy was so rich, he started his own bank, printed his own currency. Guess whose face he put on his currency? His face. You know Mount Rushmore, in this town is a big granite wall or a big rock formation. So Mount Rushmore, you got all the presidents on there. He hired somebody to carve his own face. Think about how egotistical you have to be. I want people to come through my town and see my giant head hovering above everybody. They started partnering. He didn't like that Jay stopped asking him for advice. He thought his success and Jay was managing his leather factory, they call him tanneries, better than his other partners.He didn't like that. He felt threatened. So he tried to maneuver and he said, ""Hey, we're going to end the partnership. You have to either buy me out for $60,000, which is the money I put in. Or I buy you out for $10,000, which is the money you put in. ""He did that because he's like, ""This guy doesn't have $60,000."" Didn't know that Jay has a brain. He knew this was coming and he had secretly set up financing and he was waiting for that to happen. Rockefeller is the exact same story, for his first partners in the oil industry. He had older partners who to try to screw them, and he says a great line. He's like, ""While they were talking so loud, my mind was running."" What happens is, ""Okay, I'm hitting this provision in our contract. You have to come up with $60,00."". Jay's like, ""Here it is."" And he takes off running. You had the opportunity to partner with one of the greatest entrepreneurs to ever do it, and you fumbled it because of ego. Patrick: How often do these people, men and women break the law, or enter the gray area of the law, building what they've built? David: In Jay Gold's case, all the time, because the SEC was founded 40 years later to combat things that Jay did. This is 1800. There's no securities law. Did insane things. There's no Antitrust Act yet. You could say, ""Okay, is there a person like Steve Jobs in history?"" I just said there is. Is there a person like Elon Musk? There probably is. Especially people that try to sell and over promise in some domain, just like Henry Kaiser, who is as famous in his day, as Elon is today. There is not, in the history of entrepreneurship, an equivalent to Cornelius Vanderbilt. I've read two books on him. If you said, ""Okay, David who alive today, remind you most of Cornelius Vanderbilt?"" I would say Vladimir Putin. Vanderbilt had nation level wealth. If you could have turned his entire fortune to liquid at the day he died, he would've controlled one out of every $20 in circulation.The reason I say he is not like anybody else and yeah, he breaks the law is, there's a fantastic book I did a podcast on. It's called Tycoons War. There was this other guy, I think his name is William Wallace. This is three years ago. So I'm going off memory. William Wallace was interesting, because by the time he was 18, he had graduated law school, medical school, taught himself a bunch of different languages, really smart dude, winds up taking over different parts of Mexico, which was very common at the time. He was a military adventurer. He winds up taking over, I think Nicaragua. And this is a time where Cornelius is doing the transition from just having steam boats and he is getting into railroads, but this is Gold Rush. So people are paying to be transported from the east coast to the United States, to get to California for the Gold Rush.Vanderbilt makes a ton of money, because he's one of the rare people that has steam ships, railroads, and then boats to cut through South America. And then he'll put you on a mule, and then he'll pick you up on the other side. He had basically from a to Z, he cut down travel time by six months. So substantial value. So some of his ships were stationed in Nicaragua, and Williams said, ""Hey, I overthrew the government. I am now the president of Nicaragua. So these are my ships."" Vanderbilt tried to have him killed. That's not hyperbolic. That is legitimate. He hired mercenaries to go get him. He petitioned the Secretary of State of both, the United States and Britain. He's like, ""I'm not going to sue you. I'm going to kill you."" The way they thought, you could argue that some in history's greatest entrepreneurs, they might have been more ambitious.I'm not saying go out and overthrow governments, but they did. Sam Zemurray, The Fish That ate the Whale, he did that. That's legitimate. He funded a coup, because you tried to take away his banana republic. I'm not saying these are good people. I'm just saying that they just looked at it like a problem, how we would be like, ""Oh, I can't do anything. I guess my stuff is gone. Oh, he has my ship. So what can I do? I'll try to go through diplomatic channels."" Cornelius was just like, ""I'll just send guys with guns."" Go try to steal something from Putin, what do you think's going to happen to you? Patrick: It's funny to think about some of these examples in contrast to Genghis Khan or Alexander the Great or some of the great conquerors through history, where probably there's some similar threads to pull on in both eras, but in the modern era where especially now, like Elon, everything he says, you hear about four seconds later. The feedback loop is so much tighter. So there's probably less room for shenanigans, maybe, maybe not. As you think about the role of constant learning in the story of these entrepreneurs, there was a Michael Jordan quote you sent me, which was something like, ""Successful people listen. And those that don't listen, don't survive"", or something like that. And then that's Michael Jordan, I think maybe the greatest athlete of all time. Talk about the role of constant learning. The greatest athlete of all time. Talk about the role of constant learning. This relates back to ego too. I think ego would, maybe because you stop learning because you think you know it all or something. You've mentioned several times, people study the history of their industry, people are listening. They're learning. Say a bit more about the common trait of listening and curiosity and perennial learning. David: Not only is Michael Jordan probably the greatest basketball player who ever lived, you could make the argument that he was better at his job than anybody else has been as good at their job in history. Reading his biography changed my life. I was a Michael Jordan fan when I was a kid. I don't have time to watch basketball now, I'm busy, but I'm actually standing on it right now. I record on my podcast standing up because I try to bring energy every day, but my foot is on Michael Jordan: The Life. It's a 694-page biography of Michael Jordan.What blew my mind about that is every single person, way before he even made his college team till the time he was a professional basketball, they all said the same thing. This dude was like a sponge. There's a great quote that Nick Saban said. He said that average players want to be left alone. Good players want to be coached, and great players want to be told the truth. Michael had a giant ego and a giant drive, but he would run up to the coach and tell me what I need to get better at.The reason I say that book changed my life is this idea of practice. How many people want to get to the NBA? A ton, millions. How many get? 400 maybe. How many people get to the Dream Team in Barcelona in '92, which might be the greatest basketball team of all time? 15 people. A subset of a subset of a subset. Michael's tired. He'd been playing nonstop, back-to-back. He's like, ""Man, I really want to take some time off. I don't want to spend my summer for the Olympics, but I'm going to go."" He goes, ""I want to see their practice habits. We're all the best of the best, what am I doing that's different than what they're doing?""What happened was he goes, he watched the way they practiced compared to the way he practiced. The main theme of Jordan's book is I believe in practice. I would rather miss a game than miss practice. That's insane. He said something that gives me chills to this day. He goes, ""I watched their practice habits,"" and he goes, ""they're deceiving themself about what the game requires."" Best of the best, ton of people on there, but when he was done, no one had more championships than he did.I was like, damn, that's crazy. This guy's at the top of the top winning championships, MVP, scoring awards, All-Star game, and he's still working harder than anybody else. That line, ""Successful people listen. Those who don't listen don't survive long,"" is from that biography. He's like, ""Listen, I don't have that big of an ego that I can't learn from other people.""All of history's great entrepreneurs are like that. Let's just talk about Edwin Land. Think about how crazy it is. That dude to get started, he made his money in cameras and lighting. So to understand cameras, you have to understand lighting. How did he understand lighting? He went to the New York Public Library and read every single book on lighting they had. He invented instant photography. Before Edwin Land, you took a picture, you send it to Kodak, and you got it back two weeks later. After Edwin Land, you press a button, you have it then. That's insane, dude. What did he do? He didn't say, ""Look at what I've done."" He goes and he hires Ansel Adams who he thought was a fantastic photographer. He says, he's like, ""My aim is to produce the most picture-perfect making process, and you have shit in your brain that can help me achieve that."" They're learning machines. They're like, okay, whether it's a book, whether it's a podcast, whether it's grabbing person. They're like, ""Hey, that person has information I need, I want to see if I can talk to them.""",5309
26,David Senra - Passion & Pain,Maxims to Follow in Life and Business," Patrick: You mentioned Edwin Land. There's this great quote that I think ties in here, which is something like, ""Anything worth doing is worth doing to excess."" Again what I like when you send me stuff is when it's at odds with common wisdom, everything in moderation or something like that, talk about that excessiveness. What I'm really interested in is hard work. It seems as though one of the modern things is to have a more balanced, more freedom, more flexibility. I think if you look at all these biographies and everything I've listened to from you, that is definitely not the case for these people. Again, like you've said, we're not suggesting these people are the ones to emulate. Just that they're ones that have created extraordinary outcomes. But talk about this. Everything worth doing is worth doing to excess. How you think about hard work, even though you're working your ass off to create Founders? What do you think about excessiveness and hard work? David: The full line is what Edwin Land says is like, there's something they don't teach you at Harvard Business School. If anything's worth doing, it's worth doing to excess. I put together maxims because you're going to remember that. Successful people listen; those who don't listen don't survive long. Now, stick it in your brain and go understand the idea behind that. And this is as old as humans. They've been talking in maxims and common sense and homilies forever. Think about why song lyrics are so sticky. Because it's like an idea condensed down.One of my favorite ones, and it's the main theme of the history of entrepreneurship, it's the why if you look at my phone. On my phone, my lock screen, is a picture of Ernest Shackleton, the famous polar explorer, who looks like hell. He's got a huge beard covered in ice. He looks like he's about to die. And his family motto was, ""By endurance, we conquer."" Which is why I told you earlier, I'm only interested in people who do things for a long time. Because at every single step, these people are presented with opportunities to quit and they don't. So he's like, I don't have to be the smartest. I don't have to be the best. I don't have to be the talented. This is what I believe in myself. I don't have to be the best. I don't have be the smartest. I don't to be the most talented.I just did that last year and I'm not giving up. I've had a bunch of people offer, partner up, or buy the podcast or whatever. They're like, ""Hey, you're going at an extreme pace,"" which I really don't feel like I am because I just read. There's no trick here. I pick up a book and stare at it and I do that for a few hours every day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. My daughter's like, ""Why are you reading? It's your birthday. Why are you reading, it's Christmas?"" Because I like to read. And if you do something for three or four or five hours every day that most people don't do, you're going to develop a value for other people in the world, and that's all a business is.The best description of a business I ever heard came from Richard Branson. He's like, ""All businesses, it's an idea or service that make somebody else's life better. If you make other people's life better, you'll capture that value in return."" So I don't find many of these people are moderate. I'm going to read his quote that I have saved on my phone. It's hilarious. It's by Bill Gurley's. It's called Running Down a Dream: How to Survive and Thrive in a Job you Love. But in that he profiles five people that do exactly what Michael Jordan does, that did exactly what Edwin Land does. He profiles Bob Dylan the musician, Bobby Knight the coach, Danny Meyer the restaurateur, Sam Hinkie, and Katrina Lake.What Bill Gurley did in an hour, he breaks down what are all the traits or what are their approaches to work that is similar? What does an entrepreneur have to do with a musician? A lot. What does a restaurateur have to do with a basketball coach? A lot. It's the same ideas applied to different domains. None of the people described are moderate. That's why in an hour, Bill just breaks this down perfectly. It's insane. I just finished reading Bob Dylan's autobiography, which is the book that Bill Gurley read. That dude literally discovers folk music, finds out who does folk music the best, listens every hour of his day that he's not playing.Bill's term for this is professional research, which I think is exactly what founders is. How do you get better at your job when you're not working? It's all the learning, the constant practice. That's professional research under one umbrella. So Bob Dylan engages in professional research, listening to every single record he can get his hand on, making friends with people that have hard to find records. Then he discovers Woody Guthrie and he's like, I got to go find him. Where is he? I'm in Minneapolis. I have no money. My clothes are tattered, but I have a guitar and a dream. I'll go out to the side of the road and stick my thumb out and I will hitchhike to New York city with $10 and a guitar case, find him. That's exactly what he did.So to answer your question, there's a quote I have on my phone. I've had this quote since 2017. I'm not a fan of moderation. I'm attracted to extremes. What do you want your life experience to be? Do you want to be exceptional? Do you want to push the boundaries of your capabilities? Do you want to walk around in a fog butting up against your potential but never actually realizing it? Then knock yourself out. Be moderate. I'm not interested in that. So I can't do the podcast less than I do. All I can do is say, ""Hey, this thing, this obsession of mine, will overtake my life because I've seen enough stories where it can ruin my life."" So I have boundaries. I have a balance every day. The only thing I figured out is because I'm an obsessive person. Obviously, you are. A ton of people that are listening to this as well. So what I realized is like, okay, instead of working like ton of hours, five days a week, I'll just spread everything out and have a balance, seven days a week.This is Ed Thorp. I literally just read his book, took his blueprint like, oh, I'll just do that. Ed Thorp says, ""Every hour you spend in fitness is one less day in the hospital."" First thing I do is wake up in the morning and I do an hour of some kind of physical activity, whatever you like to do. Then I work. I spend time with my kids. I spend time with my wife, and I talk to friends. Maybe have an hour or two, something that's fun. But really, work is my hobby, and that's the advantage I have over other people. Somebody listening might say, ""Hey, I'm going to do a podcast on the history of entrepreneurship."" Go ahead. You should. It's not like a zero sum game, but I'm only going to do this. I'm not going to start a fund. I'm not going to start another business. I'm only going to do this.And a lot of this is where it's comforting to me where I can give you a list of people that I've studied. Daniel Ludwig. What a crazy book I read. It's called The Invisible Billionaire. The book is very hard to find. This guy was the richest person in the world and no one knew who he was. He competed with Aristotle Onassis. Everybody knew who Onassis was. He's married to Jacqueline Kennedy and shit like that. This guy, his work was his hobby. Edwin Land, work was his hobby. Henry Ford, Enzo Ferrari, Estee Lauder, Henry Kaiser, David Ogilvy, Warren Buffet, Samson Murray, Alfred Nobel, Joseph Pulitzer, Coco Chanel, Sam Brampton. I'm going down the list. You just have an advantage because you love it.There's a guy named Larry Miller. He was the richest entrepreneur in Utah. He owned the Utah Jazz. He owned 90 different businesses, owned a 30,000 square foot house on the hill, and he's writing his autobiography as he is dying. And he's saying, ""My life is a cautionary tale. Every hour, every minute I was awake, and this comes from childhood trauma."" His mom called the cops on him, sent him to juvenile hall, kicked him out. He had this weird incessant drive to surprise like some weird sense of inferiority that he's overcoming. ""I worked every hour of the day. I don't know my wife. I didn't know my kids. Now I'm dying, I'm kind of getting to know my grandkids."" But he was excessively obese.The entire book is not like, ""Hey, look how successful I am."" You might be a billionaire, whatever it is, it's like, ""Don't do this. I screwed up."" Think about this guy's unlimited resources. And he gets to the end of his life, he's like, ""If I could do it all over again, I would've worked less. I would've took care of my health. I would've spent time with my family and I would've had fun. I never had fun in life."" That is terrifying to me. That should scare the hell out of everybody. Anybody that's obsessive, that again, worked with his hobby too, if you don't have guardrails, that's dangerous. And what's crazy is he dies. So he's working with a co-writer and he dies before the book is done. The last chapter is his wife talking to the co-author. She goes, ""I miss Larry, but it's not like he was here when he was alive."" Patrick: If you think about the role of a soul of a business, I think you sent me this interesting quote from Sidney Harman, where founders serve as guardians of the soul of a business. How do you think about the soul of your business? The business is you in many ways, but if it were to have an independent soul, I want to talk about this concept more generally too, but I want to start with you. Describe the soul of founders. What does it stand for? David: I'm not a good example of that because it's an obsession that just happens to be a podcast and podcast just happen to be businesses. I feel like I'm like the Jiro Dreams of Sushi of the podcast world, where it's just like, you have a massive audience, you have people around you, you have a movement. The way I think about it's like I read this great book called Masters of Doom, which is obviously about the video game Doom. There's John Romero and John Carmack, and John Carmack said something in what causes the rift of their partnership. He's like, ""Romero wants an empire. I just want to make great games.""Somebody hit on this. Founders is like a handmade product. And I was like, thank you because that's what I think about. It's a handmade product at scale because of the miracle of podcasting. I can do everything myself. I don't have anybody helping me. I edit it, and I also don't have script. I just read books and then I just have a conversation just like if we were at dinner. Just like Jiro Dreams of Sushi, every other podcaster I talk to, they're all super smart. They're like, ""Dude, you're crazy. You've told me that. Why the hell are you editing your own thing? Why are you doing this?"" It's because I to. I don't even have a choice.So I'm actually talking to a founder later on today who's really sharp. I met him through the podcast. I don't want to say who he is, but he's really well-known. He's got a theory about this. Again, I like talking to smart people that think I'm doing it wrong, which I love. I don't take offense to it at all. But he is like, ""You're crazy."" The soul is just me. It's like a person than it's a business. So the reason I think that's the best description of a founder that I've ever heard, it's not the same thing as managing a company that's been around for 50 years as somebody else started and maybe the founder's been dead for a long time. I really do think that's the role of the founder. Sidney Harman worked on his company for what, 50 years? You might know his name because anytime you get in a luxury car Harman Kardon, that's the guy who started that company. So he goes, the role of the founder is the guardian of the company's soul.All these books, there is the decision you can make to compromise on the quality of your product or take a shortcut or do something you would never dare do it. I just read the biography of the guy that started In-N-Out. Compared to his contemporaries, the McDonald's and Carl's Junior and all this explosion of fast food that was happening at that time in American history, not financially-successful, no. Not nearly. He only had 17 stores when he died. But he was obsessed with quality. Everybody else is saying, ""Hey, I'm going to use frozen beef""; he's like, ""I'm going to buy my own cows. I'm going to add salads and all this other stuff to my menu."" He goes, ""I'm not changing my menu at all."" It's that intense love.There's a cult. Anybody knows this. Go fly to LA and try to go to In-N-Out. Good luck. I was just in LA two months ago. Tried to go to In-N-Out twice because I read the book. I'm not waiting in that line. There's a cult around In-N-Out because the expression of the founder's soul is manifest in the product. People have In-N-Out tattoos. How many people have McDonald's tattoos? So this is also where people like, ""Hey, what's your goal? Do you want to make the biggest podcast in the world?"" No. I want to make the best podcast on the history of entrepreneurship in the world. That doesn't mean it will have more downloads than anybody else. I'm fine with that. That's not my goal.Just like if you study now obviously Apple being dominant, they have a huge market share and device and everything, but it wasn't like that. The vast majority of Apple, when they grew their cold following, it was like what? 2% of the market? 5% of the market. Microsoft was killing everything. IBM destroyed everything. The important thing is what do you want to build? Some people, I talk to founders and they say, ""Hey, I want to make an Enzo Ferrari level of craftsmanship on their product."" Ferraris being handmade. And some people take the Ford route. Ford and Ferrari existed at the same time. Ford tried to buy a Ferrari. There's a great line in the movie Ford versus Ferrari. The guy that's playing Lee Iacocca's like, ""Hey, we should be thinking like Ferrari."" He's a Ford executive at the time. And this hugely egotistical dismissive guy's like, ""We spend more on toilet paper than they spend on their whole production."" He is like, ""Yeah, but when you think of victory, you don't think of Ford. You think of Ferrari.""So you have to decide. There's nothing wrong with it. I talk to a ton of founders. Hey, usually when they want to go big, it's like, I want to make a billion dollars. Or there's a number attached to the business. If you become the founder whisperer, to have these conversations where people are just like, ""Hey, I just want to talk to the shit I'm going through with you. If there's anything that's in your brain that you've seen in these books, let me know.""And a lot of these conversations will start with, ""My goal is to be X. I want to make a 10 billion company."" I was like, ""Okay."" I always start with the same question. Who are your entrepreneurial heroes? Everybody copy somebody, dude. You're a human. I always have a maxim by saying at my podcast that the mind is a powerful place. What you feed it affects you in a powerful way. I'm very careful what I let into my mind, so I'll have these conversations and they'll start listing off all these people that influence the way they think about entrepreneurship. And I was like, ""Go read a book on him."" Did Steve jobs ever say, ""Hey, I want to make a $100 million company?"" That was never in discussion. He said, ""I want to make insanely great products. Then I want to get really good at marketing because I want everybody in the world to have an Apple device, and the way to do that is to get really good at marketing.""It's very easy to confuse yourself. That's why if you're confused as the founder and you're the guardian of the company's soul, the reason I admire Steve jobs so much, I've never come across another person that thought clearer than he did. If you could copy one thing about Steve Jobs, what did you want to know? I want his clarity of thought. It's insane. How much mental computation for decade after decade did that guy had to go through to clarify his thinking like that? You know exactly what is important to him.There's a great book by Ken Kocienda called Creative Selection. He demoed to Steve Jobs. Said the same thing. He goes, ""Listen, Steve was at the center of all circles in Apple. He was like the Oracle of Delphi. But the difference between Steve and the Oracle of Delphi was when you asked the Oracle of Delphi a question, you get back some kind of riddle. You have no idea what the hell's going on. When you get feedback from Steve, there is no ambiguity. You know exactly what Steve wants to do and that's it."" He's like, ""There's no like, 'Oh, I'm confused.'.The quote that comes to mind when I think of the founder as the guardian of the company's soul is actually a quote about Steve Jobs. It's in one of the books I read about him and he says he made and remade apple in his own image. Apple is Steve Jobs with 10,000 lives. That gives me goosebumps because that's exactly what a founder should be doing. It's impossible to build a company, to spend all your life energy on it, and not have it imbibed with your personality, with your ethics. Everything that you think about your business and your life is going to seep into it. The good and the bad parts. Patrick: It reminds me of a conversation I had with Tony Xu who started DoorDash. Tony's a very mild mannered, very humble, almost quiet person, which is why this quote from him stands out in my memory so strongly, which is I asked him something about culture. How do you think about constructing the culture of a company? His answer is basically, ""I think a culture of a company should be like 80 or 90% just the personality of the founder. That's it. It should be the extreme characteristics of the personality of the founder. Because if you try to make it generic, nothing stands out and there's no progress and there's your dominates."" I think that's basically what you're saying. These stories are fundamentally the stories of individuals replicating themselves in some interesting way like you mentioned with Jobs. And the marketing thing is such an interesting angle that I don't think you and I have ever really talked about. Because so much of the time we think about the products and that's mostly what we've talked about, the phone, the Polaroid, the airplane, the whatever, and we don't think about as much the story and the marketing. What have you learned about all of these people as it relates to marketing? Did they all tend to be good at it? Was it just a means to an end for them? What have you learned about how these people distributed or got the word out about their products over time? David: I'm a collector of maxims and aphorisms. I think my favorite one might be actions express priority. I don't look at what you say. Just look at what you do. They're marketing geniuses, all of them. What do you call a person that's gifted at customer acquisition or distribution? A founder. There's a ton of people that have great products and no one knows about, so you've failed that aspect of it. I've read a book called Insanely Simple which is written by one of the guys that worked at the ad agency that Apple used. He compares and contrast in the book Dell's approach to marketing when he worked for them and Apple's.He's like, Steve told you with his actions that marketing was important. How do he do that? Every Wednesday we had a three hour meeting. This is maybe post-iPod and before iPhone. Somewhere in there. But after, they were already having a lot more success, when he came back. He goes, we had a three hour meeting and Steve would review every single marketing ad. Every single thing. There was not a fucking billboard that was going to go up until Steve said that was okay. The reason it is important is because there's a lot of people that preach in their companies, ""Marketing's important and it just works."" Steve showed with his actions.Then you have Enzo Ferrari's just on top of mind because I read three biographies of him and I just read all of my highlights again yesterday. But he was a marketing genius too, because he's winning Le Mans. That's how he jumpstarted his company. And because of Ferrari stands for victory, you have all these rich Americans flying to Italy and they'd want to meet Enzo Ferrari.Ferrari is very mysterious. He wouldn't let you see his eyes. He'd wear sunglasses in every meeting. He did that on purpose. He thought they were like the windows of the soul and he didn't want you reading his soul. What he'd do is his employees would catch him giving a tour of this rich guy. The guy's like, ""Oh, my God, Enzo, these cars are fantastic. I must have one."" He goes, ""I appreciate that. I'll see what I can do. I might be able to get you one maybe six months, maybe 12 months from now."" Then the guy would leave and the employee would go up and be like, ""Enzo, we have a parking lot full of unsold Ferraris."" He's like, ""A Ferrari has to be desired."" He knew it. It's very similar to that fantastic podcast you just did with Rolex, with Ben Clymer. You see that same idea with a purposely limit production or don't even tell you how much they're making. There is a secrecy element to it.Edwin Land, same thing. When we think of how much Steve Jobs would practice for his presentations, he got that from Edwin Land. Edwin Land would do all kinds of crazy stuff. Way before he invented a camera, he invented polarization. So one of his main inventions was when you were driving at night, you would be blinded by the oncoming headlights of the other car. So he has that film they put over it. He was trying to sell it to a bunch of other car companies. There's a story in one of his biographies where he rents a hotel room. He figures out where the sun is going to be at what specific time, which hotel room that he needs to get that has a window that faces it. He puts a fishbowl there and then he invites the people he was trying to sell. Then at the perfect time, it shows the light emanating through the windows with the fishbowl, with and without the polarization. That's how he sold them. It's that thought process.Walt Disney, fantastic, fantastic book. Enzo Ferrari and Walt Disney have one thing in common. Both their first companies went bankrupt. That's a lot people don't know. Walt Disney, everybody's like, ""Oh, one of the best founders ever."" How could he not be, right? Everybody thinks he was a cartoonist. Yes, he invented animation, first successful full-length animation movie. But if you ask, ""Well, Disney, what is he most proud of?"" He's most proud of two things. One, starting his company and keeping control of it, because he lost control of his first company. And two, Disneyland. He did not mention animation. When he was dying. He's in the hospital dying, his brother is his partner, Roy. They're looking on the ceiling-He's in the hospital, dying. His brother is his partner, Roy. They're looking at the ceiling of his hospital room and they're going over the plans for EPCOT. He never got to see it, because he was dying. This is very common. Coco Chanel? It's a thing. They work to the day they die. Enzo Ferrari? Day they die. There's no retirement. There's not going to be a retirement for James Dyson. There wasn't a retirement for Steve Jobs.What Walt Disney was gifted at is also the amusement park. It's like, ""Hey, why are you making an amusement park?"" What people don't understand is that back then, amusement parks were seen as lowlife stuff. They were dirty, full of scam artists, more like a circus kind of thing. Walt Disney said something that was genius. They're like, ""Why are you building an amusement park? They're dirty, low-class places."" He goes, ""Exactly. Mine won't be."" The way I frame that in my mind is, ""Their mediocrity is my opportunity. There is not a great amusement park. I will be the first.""He's like, ""Okay, I need to raise money to fund Disneyland."" He borrowed against his house, borrowed against his life insurance. He was crazy. He didn't give a shit about money. He should have been way more wealthier than he was. He packaged the financing and the marketing together. He's like, ""ABC, I'll do this weekly show. I'll be the one hosting it."" The founder is the guardian of the company's soul. They would show some things from his animation, but then they would also show, ""Hey, this is what we're doing in the park,"" essentially like a weekly ad that people were watching willingly.As a result, he gets money from that. He gets perfect marketing and advertising for that, maybe the best ever, and ABC puts up a large percentage of the money needed to make the park. What happens? As a result of people watching this ... it was one of the highest-rated shows on television for a year ... the day he opens the park, it's the biggest traffic jam in Orange County history. It's not just, ""I'm going to make the very best product."" He considered the amusement park like a cast. It's just a physical movie. ""I'm building a physical movie, so I'm going to make the very best amusement park ever, and it's going to have the very best marketing."" Patrick: It sounds like a common theme in all these stories, is process as art by revealing the process behind the product, because they're so obsessed with that. That is a common marketing story. Is that right? Do you see that over and over? David: I read Warren Buffett's shareholder letters. To me it's like how many people have studied more founders and more businesses than Warren? He says in there, ""David Ogilvy is a genius."" I'm like, ""Who's David Ogilvy?"" This is years ago. I find David Ogilvy, and he's now one of my personal heroes. I read five books on him. What did he do? He did exactly what every single other entrepreneur did. Figured out what was the best shit that happened before I was alive. ""Hey, those are good ideas. Human nature doesn't change. Let's use them.""David Ogilvy winds up, in the very last chapter of Ogilvy on Advertising, he talks about the six people, the six advertising giants that came before him, that he studied, that if they were alive, he'd befriend. That's another thing Bill Gurley's talked about that's important, is going out and actually meeting these people if you can. Then he would just take all these ideas and build on it. His point was there's no such thing as a business that is boring. It's only boring advertising. He says, ""Listen, it's boring to you because you do it every day. If you explain to the customer the process, they'll find it interesting.""He did this for explaining the brewery process for one of the beer accounts he had. The person that owned the beer company was like, ""I don't want to do this. Every other brewery does it this way too."" He goes, ""Yeah, but we're the only one telling the story."" He spends three weeks ... or three months, can't remember ... researching the hell out of Rolls-Royce, talking to the engineers, reading all the material. He winds up reading a 50-page document. There's one line in it that says, ""The loudest thing in the car at 50 miles an hour was the clock inside."" He used that as a tagline, and then put a couple thousand words of copy.Walt Disney too. Maybe the best, if you want to call it a media company. I can't think of another company that has the assets that Disney has. It started with a huge fight with Roy Disney, who is the brother, the business aspect of that, and Walt Disney. They were having this fight in one of their books where it was just like, ""How much is this going to cost?"" Walt says, ""We're innovating. I'll tell you when I'm done.""To go into the process behind it, that book, Disneyland, goes into it. To your point, it's almost like opening the kimono. He shared, with the entire country, all the work and effort and detail that went into it. I shopped at Trader Joe's for a long time. It's a weird place. Interesting. I liked it. Okay. Reading the biography of the guy that started it, you have to understand why they're doing what they're doing.The example I would use is one I talk about sometimes on the podcast, because people are like, ""It sounds like you have really good recall or you can remember this stuff. You must have a really good memory."" Absolutely not. The way I make the podcast, I read a book, make the highlight. That's the first time I read the highlight. The book is done. The night before I record ... I usually record in the morning ... the night before, I'll reread all the highlights. That's the second time I've read the highlights now. I record the podcast. That is the third time I've read the highlights. I edit the podcast. That is the fourth time I've heard the highlights. Then the fifth time is I have to take pictures with the Readwise app and literally input them physically, one by one. It usually take hours to do this. That's the fifth time.People knowing that, when they feel comfortable pressing Play when they listen to Founders ... because like, ""first of all, this dude, every single episode, he's got to read an entire book to prepare. That's kind of crazy. Then second of all, he's not just reading it casually, doing it once. He's read these words five times,"" and then I'll reference them in future episodes. The only reason I'm able to reference them in future episodes is because I did that five times.If there's any part of your product that seems banal or ordinary to you, I promise you, no one is thinking about your business as much as you. The favorite business of mine in the world, you think about it less than probably five minutes a week. Nobody is thinking about it. You have shit in your brain that is interesting to customers, and then you could package that up and use that as marketing to get more customers.",7074
27,David Senra - Passion & Pain,What Makes Podcasting Such an Interesting Business," Patrick: One of the lines that stands out from listening to all your stuff, I think, is the Kinko's founder who said, and then you've adopted it, that his exit strategy is death. If I think about summing up what we've talked about so far, it would sort of be, ""Find your obsession, and then make your exit strategy death."" Your exit strategy is not to make a billion dollars or $10 billion or whatever. It's this just lifelong pursuit of your life's work, right? I'd love to apply that now to you in podcasts. My suspicion is, like you've suggested to other entrepreneurs that have done, you've studied the history of this industry. Who are your idols in entrepreneurship? I'm specifically curious about podcasting as a business, given that's what you're doing, but what have you learned about podcasting and why it's so exciting as a business? You've mentioned a little bit about the Gutenberg Press for audio or for the spoken word. If you apply Bill Gurley's kind of Bob Dylan, trained in New York concept of podcasting to yourself, what comes up? David: I have a unique advantage that Bob didn't have. There's barriers to entry. Almost all the people that are examples like that, there's barriers to entry, somebody that has to sign you. There's somebody that has to hire you, if you're like Bobby Knight. What I like about podcasting is it's completely permissionless. If I think about what is the skillset that I have, it's I can lock myself in a room with a book, a ton of espresso and a microphone, and I'm going to come out every five to seven days with an audio recording that is going to help you at your job.The thing I like about is it's all work and no work about work. I just talked about this in I think it was a Dee Hawk podcast, but it pops up over and over again that so many of them get disillusioned with the business of business. A lot of them wish they could go back to when it was just a small team, they weren't public yet, they knew everybody's name, they were actually doing some of the work themselves. Humans are terrible predictors of what they actually want. You could say, ""Okay, I'm doing the work now, but I can't wait until I can hire a team to do it, then scale that up."" Then I find myself, 15 years later, running this giant multinational public corporation. It's like, ""Oh, I don't like this anymore.""Think about this. I just read Amazon Unbound. Jeff Bezos is one of my heroes, one of the best obviously to ever do it. That's not really saying anything. I liked The Everything Store more than I liked Amazon Unbound, but Amazon Unbound, you get to the end, and one of the notes I wrote in the margin is, ""Think about it. Being the CEO of Amazon is not fun, because if it was fun, he would do it."" What you really root for is obviously you can't stay at the very beginning. The guy's got kneepads on. He's taking the books to UPS himself. You don't want to stay in that case.One thing is I was obsessed with podcasts way before I even had one. As a byproduct of that ... me and you were talking about this the other day ... where people can give you bad advice on podcasts. There was a piece of advice that I heard and I was like, ""Oh, that person that said that doesn't like podcasts. Because if that person loved podcasts, there's no fucking way that would come out of their mouth, no way."" That is why my podcast is designed the way it is, which is just like, ""Listen, I'm doing as much as I can."" I just want a way to be me at scale.I don't want to read from a script. I don't want to have to put on an act. Because if I want to do this for 40 years, until I die or whatever it is, you can't fake who you are. When people talk to you or people talk to me, what do they say? ""Oh, man, I listen to you so much, I feel like I know you."" You do. You cannot listen to me for 400 hours, listen to my podcasts, and be like I have some weird other personality.It's so funny, because I meet a lot of people from the show and I'll have dinner with them. They all say variations of, ""Oh, this is like getting a private podcast."" This is literally how I want it to be. I'm just meeting up with a friend every week and saying, ""I read some cool shit this week. Here's some stuff you might want to know. You might find it helpful.""As far as heroes in the podcasting domain, I feel the best podcaster to ever live is Dan Carlin, Hardcore History. The reason I have a single-person show is because of Dan. I've not only bought his back catalog over and over again, but I just listened to his podcast over and over again. For a long time ... now I'm reading, lately it's been a lot of audiobooks ... but almost every night, I'd fall asleep to his voice. The fact is, he inspired me to go the extra effort.One thing I didn't want to do, I didn't want to do two podcasts a year like he does. I get sad if I don't record every week. I legitimately get sad. What I like about Dan is he'll read like 30 books and then he'll do an episode. I was like, ""All right. Well, if he's reading 30 books for every episode, he does two a year, it's 60 books. I'll just read them every five to seven days and then just release them as they come.""I have a personal preference in podcasts where Dan, in his early days, he did these multiple-part series, which is really cool, but they're like an hour and a half. Now there are multiple-part series in like five hours. I get lost. I don't enjoy it as much. I still love him, but I'm like, ""I don't like five-hour-long podcasts."" Let me update it again. I don't like really long chapters in books. It's the same thing. Give me a break, dude.If you just want to pure entertainment, somebody that affected me was Bill's Burr's Monday Morning Podcast, which is as low-tech as you could possibly get. Most people, or at least people like you and I, are using podcasts to learn. What I liked about his is he's been doing it every year for over a decade. He shows up every week. I don't listen as religiously as I used to, but I don't think he's skipping any weeks. He just sets up and he talks directly to you for an hour. He might be talking about his life and all this other stuff, but it's perfect.Because if you really think about it, what I don't like, and why I think you see podcasts that have bigger audiences than cable news, is because it's all fake. Humans desire authenticity. The words that are coming out of my mouth are not coming from words that somebody else wrote on a teleprompter. This is some fake shit. If a friend talked to you like that, you'd get up from the dinner table and walk away. Like, ""What's wrong with this guy? You're sweating. You've got caked-on makeup. Why are you wearing makeup?"" I think humans crave authenticity.The reason I'm so bullish on podcasting as a business is because the village storyteller is as old as language, except now the village isn't just 10 people around a campfire. The campfire is 7 billion people. The reason why I'm so bullish on Founders is I think it'll take me to really interesting places, assuming I don't quit, which I don't plan on.They're like, ""You're wasting your time. You'll never achieve scale. Go start an enterprise software business. You'll make a lot more money."" ""I just spend my life chasing money, doing something I hate? Great advice. Thank you very much."" It's just like, ""Why won't I reach scale?"" They're like, ""Oh, because what's the biggest podcast? Maybe the biggest podcast has 10 or 15 million people."" I was like, ""Yeah, but now they do.""How many people are interested in business? How many people are interested in entrepreneurship? The way that I think about it, how many people are connected to the internet, speak English and are interested in entrepreneurship? There's like 150 million business owners around the world, something like that. Somebody out there has better numbers than I do. Last time I looked, it was like that. I don't think this is some small niche, dude.I got a freaking email yesterday ... and I love this shit. This is why I'm so obsessed with it, because you never know what they're going to do with the work you put out there. This dude listened to my podcasts. I did three or four podcasts on Jeff Bezos. He's like, ""Dude, listening to your podcast helped me get a job as an engineer at Amazon."" Then he emails me. He's like, ""I love your podcast. I wrote this software,"" and now he's analyzing all the books and writing out a software program to map out the connections for us, and he is going to make it available for everybody. Patrick: What do you think are the, if any, major aspects of the people that you've studied that we haven't talked about yet? I feel like we've talked about people's obsession, their endurance, the dark sides maybe of some of these lives, the role of marketing, the role of the team. We talked a lot about the role of the market. Are there any other major things that you find yourself constantly pointing out a segment in a book and saying, ""There it is again""? David: We may or may not have talked about the most important, and that's the best maxim in the history of entrepreneurship was said by the founder of Four Seasons, that excellence is the capacity to take pain. Anybody trying to do something difficult. How many people want to do a great achievement with their lives? Every single living person that has ever lived. No one's like, ""Oh, I don't want to do anything. I'm here and I'll just die."" They have ideas they may never pursue. They may not have the courage, they may attempt, they may fail.Think about the difficulty he had to do of trying to make not only just a hotel chain, but at the time, the best hotel chain in the world, and all the struggle he had to get to. In his autobiography, his wife would wake up in the middle of the night, see him staring at the middle of the ceiling, just racked with guilt. Anybody that's ever done anything difficult, whether it's a company, anything, knows the euphoria and terror. It's the entrepreneurial emotional rollercoaster. The reason that I think it's so important to talk about is because it is supposed to be hard. There's not a book you're going to pick up where the guy or woman's like, ""Hey, I had this idea. I started it. Everything went great,"" and the end of the book. It doesn't happen.What's fascinating to me is I never know what books are going to resonate with me either. What I really try to tell people is there are so many times where no one gives a shit about Founders. ""This isn't going to work. I'm trying to grow podcasts that doesn't have interviews. I don't have social media and I'm introverted as hell."" Then you have to make a commitment. A podcast, it's like choosing a friend. I'm asking you to spend an hour, hour and a half with me. It's not like a 30-second TikTok, dude. This is a high bar here. There was many times like, ""Man, I'll just give up."" A lot of what pushes me is these stories. Like, ""Oh, okay, this is normal.""When James Dyson says in his autobiography that there's many nights in those 14 years that he came in ... he had two mortgages on his house ... he spent the whole day trying to build a prototype. It blew up in his face, didn't work. At the end of that book, the reason's so important. It's Against the Odds, An Autobiography of James Dyson. It's hard to find, but if you can get a copy, order it. He says, ""Listen, it's easy for me to celebrate my doggedness now. I made $300 million last year, but I'd be lying to you if there wasn't times where I went inside my house, had my wife look at me in the face like I'm a failure and I'd cry myself to sleep, and I got up and did it again anyways. Because excellence is the capacity to take pain.""I apply this to like, ""I don't really feel like working out right now. I don't feel like doing cardio."" I don't give a shit, David, how you feel. How you feel is irrelevant. That's an idea I got from Henry Ford. You read his autobiography, he goes, ""I feel sorry for these ... "" I think he calls them soft and flabby men "" ... that can only do great work when they feel like it."" That was one of the first episodes of Founders I ever did. There was like 200 people listening at that point.I read the quote and they go, ""Essentially, Henry Ford is saying fuck your feelings."" That line for some reason resonated, because I didn't even know people were listening to this. Henry Ford's point was, listen, a business exists to serve other people. How you feel, there's going to be days where you get out of bed and you cannot wait to get to work, and that's great. There's going to be days where you don't want to go to work, and that is irrelevant, because the business is not about you. The business does not exist for your pleasure. The business exists to serve other people.What's surprising to me is in the Readwise app, I can segment books by author, when's the last time I read it. What's fascinating is I segmented it by what book have I highlighted the most. I was shocked at what it was. It was the autobiography of Ed Catmull, Creativity, Inc, which is the founder of Pixar. One thing that is in that book that I think is the perfect illustration of this idea that excellence is the capacity to take pain, in that it is supposed to be hard. I just heard Stanley Druckenmiller. He talked about it's the exact same phenomenon. I think he said he was working for George Soros. I don't know. I might have this wrong, which is kind of crazy. He is like, ""I lost a bunch of money."" He just went away for a while. He's like, ""I can't do this anymore. I'm not good at it. I'm an idiot."" Completely depressed. He's like, ""I've just got to go away."" The difference between Stanley and a million other investors and entrepreneurs is a million other people did that. They went away and they never came back, but he overcame. He's like, ""I'm in pain. I'm going to keep going forward.""There is a filmmaker that worked for Pixar that put this beautifully, and he used the metaphor of doing anything difficult, but for your high purposes of building a company. He says, ""If you're sailing across the ocean and your goal is to avoid weather and waves, then why the hell are you sailing?"" You have to embrace that sailing means that you can't control the elements, and there's going to be good days and there's going to be bad days. Whatever comes, you deal with it, because your goal is to eventually get to the other side. You will not be able to control exactly how you get across. That is the game you decided to be in, which is exactly what Henry Ford was telling us. Then don't run a company, dude. That is the game you've decided to be in. If your goal is to make it easier and simple, don't get in the fucking boat. Patrick: Maybe we'll call this episode Passion and Pain. Those seem to be the two themes, of people's obsessiveness, willingness to devote themselves to something, but also then to endure a ton of hardship and pain. I think it's a good place to leave it. I think you also know my traditional closing question for people. What is the kindest thing that anyone's ever done for you? David: The kindest thing anybody's ever done for me happened a few decades before I was born. My grandfather on my dad's side was living in Cuba. He was just 38 years old. He had a wife and a newborn baby when the Cuban Revolution happened and Castro took power. He didn't understand the language, had no money and no education, and yet took the gigantic risk ... and the complete correct choice at that time in his life ... to flee Cuba to go to America, to give his family a better chance and a better opportunity. That one decision changed the entire trajectory of my life.None of my interests that I happen to be naturally born into, the passions that chose me, that I did not choose, would make a lick of difference if I grew up in Castro's Cuba as opposed to America. As somebody that studies dead people for a living, it really resonates how our decisions not only affect our loved ones now and our family now and our friends now, but they reverberate through the generations. If you think about it not in the context of what's going to happen in your life this year or next year, but how the decisions you're making will affect people that aren't even born yet, you'll make your decisions differently. Patrick: It's a wonderful closing thought. I guess I'll close by just saying what I've said elsewhere, which is I find your show to be almost like a meditation app for entrepreneurs, where you open the meditation app to get recentered. I find something similar in that word comforting, which you mentioned earlier, is it's definitely there for me too of like, oh, wow, there's lots of people who are nuts about whatever it is that they're doing. It's comforting certainly for me, but also I think for tons of people that listen to your show, to just be constantly reminded of the agony, the ecstasy, the journey of building something or creating something. It's like nothing else that I've encountered for this specific function. I'm just such a huge fan. I've so enjoyed talking to you over the last several months, getting to know you and listening. I've so enjoyed this conversation today. Thanks for your time. David: I appreciate the support. You've been amazing, dude, and I really do appreciate it. I thank you very much. I put a lot of my life energy into it. To have somebody, you especially, say that you get value out of it, I don't take that for granted by any means.This site uses cookies to improve your browsing experience.

28,Katherine Boyle - Investing for America,Introduction," Patrick: Our guest today is Katherine Boyle, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz. Katherine started her career as a reporter for the Washington Post before moving into VC at General Catalyst. She now leads a practice at a16z called American Dynamism: investing in companies that are solving critical issues in areas like defense, housing and education. In the past year, I've spoken to Marc Andreessen, Josh Wolfe, and a number of founders about this need to build societally important businesses. So I was excited to explore the topic in even more detail today. Please enjoy my conversation with Katherine Boyle.",132
29,Katherine Boyle - Investing for America,What is American Dynamism?," Patrick: Katherine, I've been really excited to talk to you about this theme of what you're calling American Dynamism. I've actually explored in our other podcast, a couple companies, Hadrian and Anduril that I know you've been really involved with. And I just think this theme is on everyone's mind. Politics and geopolitics have become incredibly important again for the first time in a long time. And maybe to begin our conversation, you can just outline for us the overall idea here, and maybe the origin of the idea itself, and why did you devote an investing practice to it and why devote your career to it? What does American dynamism mean? And what is it about it that motivates you? Katherine: There's a tipping point that I think happened where it became essential that we started investing in these categories. And it was definitely started with Marc's it's time to build essay. Why are things not working? Why is it that we live in the best country in the world and we can't find PPE during COVID in New York city? For me personally, it started a little bit before that and that I spent 10 years in Washington. In my early career as a reporter at the Washington Post, when I was leaving media to understand what this technology thing was, I moved out to Silicon Valley and just became shocked by the disconnect between the two ecosystems. And I think there's a number of reasons why there's no connection between Silicon Valley and Washington and why we're trying to bridge that gap. The shocking point of it was most of the technology story in America starts with Washington working together with technologists, government initiatives, government investing.And I think it's only recently in the last say, 15, 20 years where that story really became divided and where you have technologists that became taboo to even say I would sell to government, or I would work closely with certain government agencies on hard tech or deep tech or these sorts of things. So the way that we define American dynamism is we're actively investing in companies that support the national interest. So that's everything from your classical government companies, aerospace defense, national security, where there are procurement requirements, requirements from the government that are put out to work with various private companies. But it's also things that aren't working directly with government, it's housing and education, highly regulated industries, where these are important to the goods that touch all Americans. And most of the progress that is going to come in these sectors are going to come from technological improvements, not from policy improvements, in our opinion. And so the American dynamism in practice, it's a broad practice, but it's the issues that are touching and facing all Americans and the belief that technology is going to be what solves a lot of these core issues and not policy. Patrick: If I think about one of the most famous phrases in technology in the last 20 years, it's move fast and break things, and then having investigated DOD quite a bit, it seems like it's the opposite, like move very slow and make sure nothing breaks. What created this change? You referenced the early ties between government and technology, whether that be in semiconductors or defense or the DARPA initiatives, a lot of these things that were incredibly important. What happened? Why did that critical linkage change during this recent period? Katherine: I think there's a number of reasons. And I always point to what I would call a very non-obvious reason why I think Washington has a hard time working with Silicon Valley and it's because the cultures are so disparate. So if you think about Washington media or even electoral culture, it's a zero sum game. Every two years there's an election. If you're talking about media, it's every day, I would say journalists actually function more like hedge fund managers and that they have their marks every day. Did they go viral on the internet? Did they get the front page of the newspaper? And so they're playing a repeat game every day where only one person can win. So very used to zero sum and very used to short time horizons. Where Silicon Valley operates in positive some games and long time horizons. The abundance culture of Silicon Valley is a real thing. The more companies that exist here is actually good for the ecosystem. You see the same investors investing in multiple companies, that's great. And so I think that there's a fundamental just misunderstanding between Washington and Silicon Valley of how the cultures work. And so when you actually look at that at a very micro level in government, or say the DOD, where the DOD is used to, as you said, move very slow and make sure nothing breaks. I don't want to lose my job.I don't want to get fired because I invested in the wrong company and now we don't have drones. There's this culture of let's make sure everything is going to have cover that everyone, crosses the Ts and dodge the eyes. And meanwhile, we are competing against competitors that do not have that same sort of view of how technology should be built. Russia and China are adversaries have very different views of their countries and their authoritarian regimes that can actually tell their innovators, their engineers, exactly what they want them to do. Palmer Lucky talks about this in very stark terms where it's actually easier if you're an authoritarian regime to get the technology that you want. It's actually hard I think in some ways to work through a procurement regime where you're trying to convince people that they should work with the government. But what I'd say is changed over the last few years, that's really dramatic is that Silicon Valley wants to work with government. When I moved here almost 10 years ago, it certainly wasn't the case. And so I do think there has been a see change where founders in particular are excited about these categories and are excited about working with the DOD. Patrick: I'm sure there're tons of nuance around the arguments on both sides of whether or not America is exceptional in some way, but in some ways it clearly is, historically it's got, I don't know, 5% of the world population and 60% of the enterprise value or market cap of companies. There are just kind of raw data points that would suggest something about the American system has produced exceptional outcomes and innovation. Where do you think that's most broken today? I would assume that you think there are things that need a lot of improvement and that's why you're investing in this space. Like what has becomes sclerotic or stale or frozen that needs unfreezing? Katherine: I think this is a very good question because a lot of times people ask it in the reverse of, well, why doesn't Venture Capital work for these categories? And I think our contrarian view is that it 100% will. That actually when you think about where is innovation coming from? Not only in the US, but all over the world, it is coming from risk capital. It is coming from a very I would say open system where a bunch of smart people who can tell a story can get capital, not from banks, from non-traditional needs from what used to be a niche asset class and build extraordinary companies doing very specific things. We've seen that work over the last 50 years. We've seen that work over the last 30 years with commercial internet and enterprise, but it hasn't worked for government. And so I think the actual question is, why is it that government hasn't received the spoils of this? Why is it that civic goods that are highly regulated by government or where there's a lot of capital coming out of the federal government into these systems, why are they not receiving the benefits of technology? I think it has less to do with impetus of founders wanting to work in these sectors. I think it has more to do with this question that I always come back to, which is why are the cultures of Washington and Silicon Valley so different when we want a country that believes in abundance culture?Where things happen fast, where things are delivered on time, where roads are paved, we want this, what is the issue that is stopping this from happening? I would argue that it's much more on the regulatory side, but also this cultural difference where I do think for too long, a unique feature I think of Silicon Valley being so far away from Washington and having developed so far away from east coast institutions. They are very different ecosystems that really have to learn the same language where I've been hopeful in the past few years is that I do think the DOD has actually done a very good job of learning how Silicon Valley works. Silicon Valley is doing a good job of learning how institutions in Washington work. And we just need more of that crossover between two different cultures. Patrick: I'm curious to learn a little bit about your lessons from that period as a journalist. I guess the first question is, why you did it in the first place? What drew you to that career at the Washington Post? And then I'll ask what you learned along the way, good and bad, but what originally drew you there? Katherine: There's a lot of similarities between investing and between journalism, truth seeking is the cliche obvious thing. But if you're someone who's deeply curious, deeply passionate about knowing things, about knowing the truth, then I think it's an obvious place to land. I think where I was actually very fortunate, I didn't see it as fortunate at the time, but living through what I would call one of the most historic business stories of the last a hundred years, which is watching extreme monopoly, newspapers in America, especially like the Washington Post or the New York Times where monopoly is not only in their regions, but monopoly is across the country. Watching the monopoly just be destroyed within five years by innovation. It was all that we talked about. I saw many, many colleagues get fired. This was before Bezos bought the paper and invested a lot of capital and subscription really took off, but they saw two of their three business models die, syndication and advertising.When you're watching that as someone who's deeply interested in the why question, I felt like I was missing the biggest story of my time, not in tech. We knew why this was happening, but why am I in Washington when all of the innovation that's happening, that's creating this historic moment is happening in Silicon Valley with these companies. And so I was really fortunate. I was early enough in my career that I could pop over to tech and through Hail Mary passed and ended up at Stanford business school. Approached moving to Silicon Valley almost as a research subject of how do I understand what's going on, and then of course, Venture Capital I think is very similar to that. Where if you're obsessed with being on the forefront of cultural shift and movement and new ideas, there's no better career than an early stage investor talking to people all day and trying to understand what's happening and what will happen in the future. Patrick: How would you describe the power landscape in media today to someone that was trying to understand it for the first time? Katherine: It's interesting because I do think that when I was at the Washington Post, the story could have gone a very different way. There's a number of reasons why the consolidation happened in the media, where there used to be probably a dozen regional newspapers that mattered, now there's a few, there's a handful. And I would say that they are playing a very different game than they were 10 years ago. When I was at the Washington Post, there was no Twitter culture. This was 10, 12 years ago. So now the games that are being played in terms of how do you win the news cycle are very focused on this integration with tech on this distribution through Twitter that is new. So where is the power cycle? You could argue that it's still the New York Times and still the Washington Post, because they did consolidate their business model and with the investment that they have, they can certainly lead the new cycle, but I also think they are playing a tech game. And that was not the case maybe 10, 15 years ago. Patrick: I wonder if you could list for us where you think the major categories of interest are in this kind of American dynamism umbrella, and then I'd love to go through maybe not all of them, but several of them just understand the state of play today. Defense is one, we'll definitely talk about defense. What are the other major categories that you think matter most in terms of potential impact? Katherine: It's a broad category. So I would say aerospace and defense are the classical things. What's changed about those categories is that now there are winners. So 10 years ago, you could say, we've always had a robust aerospace industry. We've always had a robust defense industry, but new space and new defense coming out of Silicon Valley, those did not exist. And so now there are winners, now there are examples of how to work with DOD, and we're really bullish there. Say there's also an underlying sector beyond that, which is suppliers in those categories. So I know you've talked to Chris Power at Hadrian, which is innovation on manufacturing for those sectors and for sectors even beyond that at a certain point. So we're interested in how do you bring automation to manufacturing? What sectors are going to benefit most there? Coming out of COVID, especially, I think there's sort of a broad view, not only in Washington, but in technology that education is ripe for transformation. Not only education at the earliest of stages, say K through 12, but education, higher education, where when you go through two years of everything moving online, and then every parent seeing what their children are learning and how they're learning there becomes a huge push for, well, maybe the 19th century model that we've been using is not the best way to educate all children and maybe there should be some variance in how we educate.You're seeing that not only in the technology sector, which I think has always made that argument, but you're also seeing it now in the political sector, which is things like the state of Arizona going to a universal ESA, education savings account, where now parents can opt-out of the public school system and put their kids into a variety of alternative education programs. So when you look at states making those decisions, that leads to just a rebirth of companies that will be suppliers because of that policy change. It's not only companies that are selling direct to government, but it's also companies that are, you could say, competing with government, where they see themselves as an alternative to the government solutions that have historically served most citizens.",3138
30,Katherine Boyle - Investing for America,An Investor's Perspective on Government and Industry," Patrick: How do you think about the lenses through which you have to make investment decisions in these categories relative to a software company that's down the fairway for Silicon Valley these days? A lot of these businesses are old school in some sense, they're building something physical. There's the technology and innovation behind whatever they're building, there's complexity and CapEx and cost, and the business models are just really different. So what matters more or less to you as an investor relative to maybe some of your colleagues I was going to say down the hall, but now your headquarters is in the cloud, around the corner of the cloud or whatever, what's the difference? Katherine: Silicon Valley has always divided itself on business model. And I agree with you, this is not a category where business model is at the forefront. You're either consumer business or an enterprise business, but a government business. What does that mean? I'd say the thing that I have noticed most about the founders that found these companies, they're unique historians of the sector while an enterprise or consumer, you often see young, maybe college dropouts or people who are just obsessed with a certain type of technology or as technological movement who sort of find themselves solving a very unique problem to themselves. A group of kids coming out of a university can build something in consumer and build an extraordinary company. I think it's less so in government, I think there has to be some sort of domain expertise at the same time expertise in government can lead to sort of nihilism. It can lead to this belief that like, oh, you're never going to get it done. So where we've seen founders really excel in these categories is they often know the problem cold in a way that just other founders don't often know the answers. They have been studying students of history of these sectors for a very, very long time. And that comes out in you recently had a conversation with Brian Schimpf of Anduril. I mean, talk about someone who just knows the entire history of defense procurement. Patrick: Amazing. Katherine: Someone who came to the problem just knowing all of the intricacies of it. And all the founders of Anduril had that knowledge and expertise of here's how you have to really push the business model in order to build, you can make the same case that SpaceX had that intense knowledge of not only the technology and what needed to happen, but also how to work with government. I think that's what we have noticed is that there just has to be a true understanding of the sector and what needs to change. And then a lot of evangelism of what needs to change as you probably saw with someone like Chris Power, when he was talking about Hadrian, these are founders that truly are evangelizing oftentimes business model change or technological change are constantly talking about it because they are at the forefront of this change. So I think that's something that we very much look for is founders who have that capability, but not only have the historical knowledge of what they need to do. Also, it helps with recruiting. It helps with raising capital. All of these companies, I would say are extremely capital intensive. And so being able to make the case that, yes, this is how things have been, but here's the paradigm shift that's happening and being at the forefront of that, it's almost table stakes for founders. You know, we often say this about deep tech companies, where there's a graveyard of companies with great technologists who've spun out of universities where the technology was great, but they couldn't make the case, they couldn't tell the story, they couldn't raise enough capital to get through the valley of death. What we've seen with the founders who've been successful in these sectors is that they are just incredible at convincing people that this paradigm shift will happen. Patrick: Say a bit about, again, maybe harkening back to your time in Washington and understanding of government at a deep level, both from both angles. Is there anything fundamentally broken about government? If we think about the levers or the variables that would most positively impact the odds that we develop great technologies that are sort of national interest technologies is one of those major variables that the government itself is the approval rating is whatever it is crazy low, typically lots of extremely entrenched Congress people. What are the problems there that you've seen? Do you think that we need to maybe fix some of those before we have the best possible outcome on the innovation side? Katherine: There's a really interesting website called WTF Happened In 1971. And it shows all of the different charts of how many pages have been added to the federal registrar since 1971. You could make the argument that the fundamental shift with government and why things have gotten slower, even though government has historically been set up to be slow moving and compared to the private sector, is that we've just gotten so good at making laws, not only laws, just making regulations that make things very, very difficult to move. And that's not necessarily lawmakers who are democratically elected, those are bureaucrats who've been in Washington operating in different agencies for 20, 30 years. So when you just let that compound over time and just look at how many pages have been added to various regulations, any smart entrepreneur who's looking at that is going to say, okay, I'm not going to wait 36 months to get something through planning when 36 months in the private sector, which has been accelerating since the 1970s, because of technology is a crucial thing. So I actually think it's become harder. If you see this kind of acceleration in the private sector versus this lag in the public sector for anyone truly looking at can something get done in government to want to enter the public sector. That being said, I think there has been an educational shift in very small pockets of government, the DOD being one of them, where it's become just so catastrophic to not move that there are changes being made to work with I would say enterprising AI companies, startups that can move really fast. Around certain pockets, you're still fighting against that entropy and government and that pain of getting through all of the regulatory morass that has been piling up, been this acceleration in the '70s. Patrick: You remind me of this idea of this guy named John Gall, who wrote a book called The Systems Bible where the goal of any system is not the thing it was designed for, but it's actually to keep itself alive. And the Congress is maybe seeing governments an interesting example of that. As you think about these categories, maybe we can zoom on aerospace and defense. What excites you about this? What is I guess the end demand that is driving so much of this opportunity to create innovative new supply, selling to the DOD, selling to government in and around aerospace and defense. What is the thing in the world that creates the opportunity? Katherine: The opportunity actually does come from people who are working hard in government to try to change the procurement system and who say actually we need new technologies that we haven't been able to acquire. So there is a paradigm shift happening in the DOD, which has said we used to need battleships. We used to need tanks. We used to need hardware. And we have a procurement system that was set up in the sixties and seventies to acquire from the industrial base tanks battleships. Now we actually need software and we have not been able to acquire the best talent, acquire the best technologies in the software domain because of the way we were set up. There used to be a view I'd say maybe even 10, 15 years ago, that defense primes that were set up to work directly with government would be able to solve that problem. I think there is now an understanding that the best talent does not go to work at Lockheed Martin, that they go to work at exceptional startups. And that is I would say a new trend that's happened over the last 15 years and the government is aware of that. So there are smart pockets in the government. You know, some of the best technologists that I've met working in government are at the DOD and they know what's needed. They know what the war fighter needs. And there's these crucial moments that have happened in recent years and I would actually say Ukraine is also leading to an acceleration here where there's an understanding that what we've been talking about for five, seven years about Russia and China actually becoming resurgent and becoming true adversaries to the US like that is happening. It's no longer theoretical, it's no longer something that's just talked about behind closed doors.There's an understanding that we have to get our best and brightest who are in Silicon Valley to work directly with the DOD. So that paradigm shift excites me because before it was a lot of lip service and now it's how do we do this? I think the how question is really hard. But the second thing that I'd say excites me is that you often see this with categories that are very difficult to build in is you only really need one winner. It opens the floodgates for everyone understanding the playbook. And one of the things in aerospace and defense that's happened over the last 20 years is that Elon has been building in public. There are now thousands of people who've worked at SpaceX who can leave SpaceX and go build space startups with the playbook, understanding that the factory is the product, understanding how to work with government, understanding the pace that needs to happen. And I'd say the same thing is true of Anduril where five year old company has really shown by building in public that you can work with the DOD, this is how you get contracts. This is how you have to get through the valley of death. And that one to two years out, trying to convince the government that you have the best product. And so all it really takes I believe is one company to really teach others who have been in that company and others in the ecosystem, how to work with these agencies. I think in some ways we indebted to the market leaders in these categories where SpaceX and Anduril have really changed the game in terms of educating other companies in the sector. And that's why you're seeing a lot of fast followers, a lot of companies that aren't making the same mistakes that Palantir did that are using the playbook that I think is replicable. Patrick: Can you explain this idea that the factory is the product? I haven't heard that before. Katherine: It's the idea that in some ways, how you do the process, Chris Power at Hadrian talks a lot about like the actual process and decisions you make about the system are the resulting product. If you're building a manufacturing plan, if you're building a machine shop and you're adding automation, the crucial decisions that you are making inside the factory about how you build actually leads to greater scale. When you've met with Chris before and anchored his story of the early factory, factory one, factory two, all of these things that you're doing, which will take a lot of capital in order to ensure that you're building at scale, that in a way that can be replicated quickly, every third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh factory, beyond that you are benefiting from those early decisions that you have made and the products that are coming out of it, the quality of the product is getting better, not just because of the decisions about the product itself, but about how you've built the system. That becomes incredibly important in something like aerospace of defense, where these supply chain questions that a lot of the primes have been really about how the systems are architected and engineered and less about the underlying product that comes out of the factory. Patrick: How big is this market? How much spending is happening today, setting aside what might happen in the future? I assume it'll grow, but what is the state of it today? I think maybe people might be surprised by just how much money is flowing in aerospace and defense just now. Katherine: You can slice it and dice it different ways, but I'd say the NDAA is 780 billion dollars I believe in the last NDAA that was passed. And then you also add on other five ally countries. So the countries that we are allies with that we work very closely with, UK, New Zealand, Australia. You add on those countries where their budgets are obviously much smaller, but that's over 1.2, 1.3 trillion in spend. And then you add on the countries we do new business with through the state department. So we do as a country supply a lot of the rest of the world that we see as allies and that we see as strategically important that's annual spend. Obviously, there's a lot of operational spend as well. The thing that makes me so much stoic about how you look at the market is that something like 40% of that sort of procurement spend is spent on five companies that supply the DOD. So the big five, the primes, the Lockheed Martins Pantheons of the world. What I think has made it very difficult for startups to get part of that spend is that a lot of those decisions are made based on tailored RFPs, tailored requirements that go out specifically for a company where a lot of lobbying has happened. So while the market is exceptionally large, the piece that a lot of startups that are going into defense have to look at is much smaller than that.It's usually the money that has not been put forward for programs of record, which are usually only going to go to companies that have been around for many cases, a hundred years and consolidated over a hundred years. So the thing that I think companies in new space and new defense have done quite well is they're going after pockets of spend that are seen as almost like a political pocket to spend. What I mean by that is there's not a bunch of companies trying to get dollars around some of these areas, the brilliance of something like Anduril was they were focused on a product that a lot of the prime just wouldn't make. And so if there are key requirements that need to be met where you're not competing against the prime. For a lot of startups, starting with those smaller pockets of money that really don't touch the larger players is the way that you get an entry point, a proof point. And then you move up the categories of spend oftentimes categories that have existed for 20, 30 years. And not just the emerging technology categories of spend where you're just going, be competing against other startups.",3098
31,Katherine Boyle - Investing for America,Lobbying and Other Entrenched Systems," Patrick: It sounds like classic disruptive innovation or counter positioning, whichever term you want to use. You mentioned lobbying. I don't know how to ask anything, but a really simple version of this question, which is how does lobbying work? I don't really know much about lobbying. It sounds like it's an ingredient that matters for the defense ability of the Primes business. So what is going on, who is doing what and why in the world of lobbying? Katherine: This is such a broad question. I'm going to take us on a tangent, but I feel like this needs to be said. So it recently came out of the NDAA that it struck a provision that would've prevented DJI, which is the number one Chinese drone manufacturer from selling to government agencies. This is something that DOD has been worried about and has actually stopped from happening for the last five to seven years. The Financial Times said it was $4 million over 2018 to 2022 that DJI and the CCP have been able to successfully lobby the US government to stop that blanket ban on DJI selling to American law enforcement companies. Of course, DJI is collecting very sensitive data from the government, and that's why they had been banned, I believe since 2016, 2017. And yet this is something where, because of the ridiculousness of our system, a foreign company can come in and lobby to work directly with the US, even though the people in the DOD are terrified of what this company could possibly do. The hard thing about lobbying is that there are so many going back to our question about federal registrar and just like how many laws there are, and just how many different ways you could work with government. There's so many sort of inroads to stop legislation from either happening or not happening. I have traditional answer to why does lobbying matter in this sector is that Congress authorizes a spending bill and there are line items that go for different programs. And it is very much understood that if you get a line item in a spending bill that is tailor made for you, that ultimately that is saying that you will work with that company in perpetuity.It's very hard if this has been tailored made from legislation perspective, it's very hard to actually say, okay, now we're going to work with a different company or rebid. The thing that makes lobbying very important is for a lot of these programs, companies very much want to become a program of record. They want to be institutionalized as this supplier that will ultimately work with government. Yes, there are times where these contracts are rebid or re-competed. Ultimately, the primes do a very good job of making sure that they continue to be the supplier and that there's perpetuity in that. The thing that I think makes it very hard for startups is you go from small business grants, which are non-recurring to these other types of small dollar grants that ultimately hoping to get a program that can then be institutionalized by Congress. If you're working with Congress on lobbying, to make sure that your company is ultimately chosen, it does require sort of, not only just working with procurement officers at the DOD for a lot of these big companies, it's making the case in front of Congress as well. And that's I think the unique system of our government, which is that Congress does have tremendous oversight of the DOD. And so there are positives of that where we do have an oversight of how our bureaucratic institutions or how our executive branch is functioning, but it does lead to this lobby and as being an important part of building a company in these sectors, it's not just the best technology wins and someone who's very smart in the DOD is going to choose which one that is. There's a lot of I'd say different levers that exist in Washington that make decisions around which companies are chosen. Patrick: Do you have to think hard about how something like warfare is going to change in the future? Or do you rely on more of a bottom up method when investing to say, you're waiting for someone to come to you with something that you can then underwrite and is compelling, or are you coming at it like, we think the world's going to end up looking this way, going to be more autonomous drones or something. So we're going to look for drone companies. Do you sense yourself going more top down or more bottom up? Katherine: So I think it's definitely more bottom up. And again, it goes back to the nature of founders have a deep understanding of what's happening in their own sectors. Classical technology, if you're talking about infrastructure technology or consumers can see, okay, where are things headed potentially? Where are the pockets where we're missing? I think in these categories, it's usually the founders who are the most up to speed on actually, this is what the DOD cares about. I know this because I've been inside a company where this is something where they are looking for it. You could argue if you're on the ground in Washington, talking to lawmakers, they're going to tell you like, okay, we really care about hyper-sonics now, understandings where technology is headed. But I'd say the founders are usually the most educated on what is going to be important in these sectors so we listen to them. It's not something necessarily where you can predict geopolitical strife and say, okay, this is something that's going to be needed. You could have made the case that we are moving towards a more automated, potentially less kinetic world where drones are much more necessary, where there are technological advances that the government is excited about that will allow for that. But I'm not necessarily sure that it makes the most sense for us to be dictating what government wants. Patrick: As we start to escape the DOD as the buyer, that huge budget as a buyer, where else do you find yourself most commonly pulled? You mentioned education earlier. That's something that I feel like lots of people feel is fundamentally broken in certain ways, but also incredibly entrenched. It seems as though the rebel attacks against the entrenched system have just failed for the most part. Do you think that's true, and what might change that? Katherine: I think it's true that yes, if you're calling them rebel attacks that they failed, that's partially true. But I do think that COVID was the inevitable see change that forced and particularly I'm much more bullish on K through 12 education at this point than higher ed. That COVID changed how parents view the decision about how to educate their children. I don't think you can come out of two years of school closures worried about continued school closures. Also, just understanding, hey, we live in a world that's very different from the 19th century and yet these are the types of subjects our students are learning. There's a number I'd say of cultural factors that have led parents to say, I want an alternative. And that pressure that grounds up say state and local pressure on politicians, you are seeing states get very excited about the prospect of treating education, the same way we treat healthcare. So the ESA movement education, saving account movement, is a really exciting movement because it looks a lot like FSA. It looks a lot like, okay, we can actually give taxpayer dollars to parents to make their own decisions about how they want to educate their children. What's interesting about that too is that there are some states that want to do it as a universal ESA, where every parent can make that decision there're others, where it's because of the influx of new migrants, I'd say Texas, Florida, Arizona states that are growing with people from other states, you can't build schools fast enough to educate kids.So you have to deregulate the, okay, we need five years of funding and we need five years to build a schoolhouse. Like actually we can do this online. We can put a school in a park and allow for alternative education and give those dollars to those parents in order for them to make their own decisions. There's a lot of popular arguments on both sides for the politicians who are asking themselves how do we educate kids in this unique time where maybe things will close and maybe we've gotten an influx of 200,000 students that we don't know what to do with that's led to people rethinking a 19th century model that everyone knows is broken. I also think there's another argument here where people opting out of the system often improves the system, the underlying system at hand, and that's become, I think, a much more popular argument among K through 12 advocates that actually we've been talking about small class size for a long time. And so if we have more schools that are deregulated in many ways, like that's actually a good thing for the underlying public schools where you've moved from a class of 40 to a class of 18, there's a lot of arguments on both sides that have actually led to a political movement that will ultimately lead to a technological movement. Patrick: What are the ways in that 19th century model? What is most broken? What do you think is the biggest or couple biggest fundamental problems with the current model in K through 12? Katherine: I think we know the best way to educate kids is in a small environment, a tutoring environment has always been kids learn at very different rates. They learn at very different levels. They have different interests. I have an 18 month old son and I'm even seeing now, I think once you have a kid, you realize, wow, all children are different and they have different needs. And so I think parents have always fundamentally known that, but the ultimate reason why public education is so important and why sending kids to a traditional school is important is because it operates as a way for oftentimes what has become the norm to income households in America, where everyone is working. There needs to be a place where children are watched. I think people know that fundamental issue with education is that you have to do it in a way that's scalable, but by deregulating the system in many ways so that parents can make the decisions about actually, I'd like to send my child to a micro school where I know the teacher, where I know the other parents, or actually I like the homeschooling model where I can hire a tutor among many. The exciting part about this movement that happened during COVID is that it was an organic movement where there was a lot of experimentation led because we were an emergency situation where a lot of parents take into their own hands. And as we saw the same way with workforce culture, where we were pleasantly surprised by remote work, pleasantly surprised by how well it worked, I think a lot of parents had the same reaction where they were pleasantly surprised by hiring one teacher for five students.How that was actually much more economical for certain families, especially if they're getting vouchers or if they're getting ESA dollars and how that was actually something that allowed parents to have a little bit more control over the subjects that they're learning to your other question about what's changed about the 19th century model. I think we've moved from thinking that grammar and reading and some of these other subjects that are so core to how you educate baseline things of universal literacy, which is an important noble goal in the 19th century that actually like universal stem education would be something that is 100% necessary going into the 21st century. And that's not something that's happening at public schools across America. If parents are realizing that now that the economy is completely changed, that the subjects kids are going to need to learn are very different from the subjects that they needed to learn before. Then if there is culture wars happening in certain cities where making math something that kids don't necessarily have to learn or making math a bad word, parents are getting upset about that. I'd say there's a third issue happening where parents are realizing that in some ways, if they want their children to learn higher level math, they'll have to take matters into their own hands and a lot of states are excited to give them tax dollars to do that.",2562
32,Katherine Boyle - Investing for America,"Migration, Inflation, and Education"," Patrick: What have you learned about how states are, and might in the future, competing for citizens? It seems like the product of a state is becoming higher and higher variance. Some of that's imposed through things like Roe V. Wade being overturned. Some of it is optional and has been like tax rate. It just seems like states are positioning themselves more and more. Do you think that's going to happen more in the future? How does that play into all of what you're trying to do? It seems like an interesting trend that matters. Katherine: I believe the resurgence of federalism is real and it is technology enabled. I've made the case that Starlink will enable a new type of federalism in ways that other technology hasn't. Because if we move to a remote work culture, the most important thing is internet infrastructure. And if you can move to a state where you're surrounded by people who share your values, where you are surrounded by policies that you prefer, it opens up this incredible migration that I think we've only begun to see through COVID. So I was certainly part of that. I left California in 2020 and moved to Florida joined the Miami movement. I think that mayor Francis SW as a perfect example of this as sort of an unknown mayor, was able to get on Twitter and able to evangelize his city to an entire demographic, basically go after an entire industry and say, hey, come here. Not only do we have favorable policies, but you're actually going to love it and we're going to embrace you. I think in some ways he started this, we can actually differentiate through policy.We don't need everyone to come here, but if we can get one industry we're excited about, that's actually a good thing. And so I think you're going to see more and more in that. That's one of, I'd say the benefits of the American system is federalism. And so if someone is really allied with the mission of a certain mayor in Miami, they can move there and they can keep their job in many cases and they can operate remotely. Whereas before 2020, that was not the case. There was always the question of, if I decide to move to another city, what will I do for a living? What will my community look like? But now you see people moving in pockets, keeping their jobs, living in multiple places, say spending six months in one place and six months in another. And I think that's actually good for states organizing themselves around certain values and certain things that they care about. Patrick: Kind of like my question on something about government need to change to create the best outcome. I have a similar question on immigration. I don't have the stats exactly handy, but certainly some crazy percent of that market cap I referenced earlier was created by first generation immigrants or second generation immigrants. Obviously, America's story is one of immigrants in a deep fundamental way. In some ways that can, and as we've seen conflict for certain people with the national interest and who's here already, what role do you think this plays in the range of outcomes that we're going to see from here? If national interest is the north star, where does immigration fit in your mind? Katherine: I think the statistic that I've read is that of unicorn co-founders. So companies that are valued over a billion or more something like 50% of companies have a foreign born founder, that is an extraordinary statistics. The US has done an excellent job over the last 50 years of making sure that the best talent from other countries decides to come here and work and build that is a feature of the system that we've been able to construct. I mean, one of the things that I love about Miami is that it's mostly foreign born as a city, the energy and enthusiasm, and the seriousness that exists in the city is people coming from countries that are collapsing or have collapsed, or are authoritarian coming to the US and waving the American flag very proudly. One of the things that I'll say about movie from California to movie to Florida is I see more American flags in Miami than anywhere else that I'd like, oh, interesting, Washington, DC, California, people are proud to be in this country and they're proud to build in this country.And there's a hustle culture I would say that comes from having left somewhere that is collapsed, where you are excited to be in a capitalist system. And you are excited to be in a place where you can build a new life for yourself and your family. And that is the American story. So I think Silicon Valley embodies that and it always has embodied that. And we should celebrate that people come from all over to build. As you saw, Chris power of Hadrian came from Australia a few years ago. And one of the things he says is that being embraced by this country, being embraced by entrepreneurs to help build for the defense industrial base in this country is something that is a feature of the country. And certainly something we should celebrate. Patrick: One of the categories that you've listed before elsewhere, that I just find so interesting today is housing. You know, this is something that it all goes well, I think it could be a problem. And it also seems super nuanced. I don't know a ton about housing supply and what drives it. I know it's a category that you have some interest in. Maybe teach us a little bit about that interest. Why is housing a relevant subcategory of American dynamism to you? Katherine: It's an important category in that where you live and being able to afford housing is probably the most fundamental human good. It's probably the most fundamental thing that people worry about. In the past few years, we've seen an influx of housing startups, mostly related to ADU legislation or accessory dwelling unit legislation in California, which was the deregulation of you can put a new small backyard home in your house, on your property, very easily without having to get the extreme permitting to build new housing, something that is pre-manufactured. And ultimately, it drives income up for people who are homeowners, or maybe you have a child that wants to move back in with you and you want to give them a little bit of space. So we're supposed to be a deregulation in California that addressed affordable housing. And we've seen a ton, a ton of companies operating in that space and trying to build in that space. One of the things that I've noticed and that I'm hopeful about is that I actually think there are states where it's much easier to build housing. One of the things we've seen is that a lot of the companies that are focused on ADUs are focused on the top of the market, like the Tesla model, where if you build very fancy houses, if you build very fancy ADUs, you can then come down the cost curve. I'm actually very bullish on what does a new mobile home look like.We actually have prefab manufacturing in this country that is very robust. I think there's a marketing challenge around prefab that just really isn't discussed. Prefab is much more common in other countries around the world here. It's usually I'd say looked at as more of a low income solution. Can there be design fixes for middle class populations to do prefab in states where there's already kind of a deregulated environment to make solutions that already exist much more modern? That's one thing we're thinking through. The hard thing about housing is the places that have the hardest time because they are so regulated in terms of permitting are the ones with the dire housing shortages. Obviously, again, it becomes a government problem and not necessarily a tech problem, but I will say the push on now remote work and the federalism point has led a lot of people who were trying to make it in places like San Francisco and New York move out of these cities into ex-urban environments where it is deregulated where you can build a house and afford a home for your family. And that is going to put political pressure on a lot of these cities to deregulate the permitting issues that have often kept housing out of places like San Francisco. And so if enough people leave, I do think that there will be changes there and that technology can then move into some of these sectors and actually make it much easier to build. Patrick: How do you interpret that now very famous chart that shows inflation in certain categories over time, there's like blue on the bottom and red on the top I'm sure on the one I'm talking about. And a lot of the categories that we've talked about are in that red grouping of the cost of a college education, for example, has ballooned like crazy over the last 30, 40 years. Whereas the cost of a Samsung TV or something that's like unregulated driven by technology as completely plummeted. What is your interpretation of why that chart is so important? Katherine: It's really housing, education, and healthcare. And when you think they are the most regulated sectors, they're also the most subsidized by government and there's the least competition. We haven't talked about higher education, but I think one of the most meaningful things that could happen, and one of the things that just isn't discussed enough is that for a very long time, both Republicans and Democrats, and there was a universal push that the way we solve our problems in this country is by sending all children to college, which has made college 10 times more expensive for our generation than our parents' generation, because it is so subsidized. It's also left a generation of millennials and younger and extreme debt, which then leads to these other questions of healthcare and housing that make it almost impossible for the middle class to exist. I think there needs to be a broader conversation around why we've been subsidizing institutions that are failing to help get jobs for young people, which is why they are going to college and bring back a culture of manufacturing, a culture of working with your hands, a culture of being a trades' person, which we know are where the most extreme labor shortages are in this country, which we do not celebrate as a culture.We still have this bias to every kid needs to go to college and that will show that we are a successful country. One of the things that we're excited about is we are seeing a lot of companies that are focused on how do we bring more young people into trades? That's I would say a secondary mission of Hadrian as well is how do you teach more young people, machining make it easier for them with updated tools and updated technology so that it is again, a job that people want and they find valuable. I'd argue that a lot of the reasons why that chart is exclusive for the public goods that used to define middle class life is because they have been so regulated subsidized, and there has been such lack of competition in those categories. You could also make the same case for defense that because of the rampant consolidation of going from 17,000 companies to five companies that are getting 40% of the defense budget, that the cost of defense has gone up dramatically because there is no competition that I think is the sad story of companies that operate in government is oftentimes where you need competition. There really is just monopolistic forces that lead to one or two companies being able to raise prices, the case of universities, that's certainly the case. Without having to make changes or innovate or truly open up their model because of technology. Patrick: How different are the investing dynamics in all this stuff? I'm picturing Hadrian factory one and two, and how much harder and more expensive they must be to build than a mobile app or something. What are the round sizes like compared to a tradition like software investment? How do you think about valuation in this world? Your founders end up owning less because there's just so much capital required to get SpaceX to where it is today or whatever, does it take longer? I'm just curious about the nature of the investing side and the dynamics you've been covered so far. Katherine: I'll use a case study we haven't talked about yet, which is a company called Flock Safety in our portfolio. And they are a company that works with public safety around the country that created a license plate reader. They are hardware, software hybrid, small license plate reader, empowered by AI that tracks cars, not people. Founded Atlanta, Georgia, founded in 2017 by a terrific second time founder. And I would say that the tailwinds for this company are extraordinary. They're now in all 50 states, they're now operating selling to law enforcement. They actually started out selling to homeowners associations. And what's interesting about their story is with a lot of these companies that are Harbor software hybrids, or that take more capital upfront. The early sort of stage investing is actually very difficult. And I would say like, this is actually one of the things. And one of the reasons why we're excited to create this practice and say that we're investing at seed, is that for a lot of these companies, yes, they take a little bit more capital. And it also just takes a little bit more time for these companies to work. Not only are you building a hardware product, but you're also selling to government, they're government is a major stakeholder. So up into the right that you expect to see at series A and these companies, these companies go a little bit further down the J curve, oftentimes at series A, they have no revenue. Oftentimes they're still working on V2 of the product where it takes a founder who can tell an extraordinary story who can rally the troops of the company even if the revenue numbers do not look like up in the right that you would see in FinTech, or you would see in pure software. But what happens after these companies get to contracts with government, or they hit critical masses that oftentimes they're not competing against a wide swath of other startups.They're usually competing against legacy incumbents, they can move much faster. There's a network effect that exists in government that I think a lot of people don't talk about, which is if one county does something and it's working, all of the other neighboring counties wants to look great too and wants to be a hero for their citizens and so they'll move much faster. So oftentimes these companies accelerate at series C or at series D and they become explosive competing against no one, which is very different, I'd say than SaaS or pure software where if something is doing really well in a category, oftentimes there's a lot of fast followers. And because there's no fundraising or hardware mode or team mode, you actually do see a lot of fast followers. The reason why SpaceX doesn't have fast followers, Anduril doesn't have the same fast followers competing in the same way. Flock certainly doesn't. What you see is that these companies are hard to build seed through series B and then they hit escape velocity, and they look very different from other companies. And oftentimes become these large legacy entrenched companies. So people get excited about these companies at later stage. We're excited about them early because there is a founder profile. There's a company profile that we look for early stage and it does look different. It's not driven by looking for a certain ARR at series a where we get excited about sort of the progress they've made Patrick: Are the expected returns any different? Do you think than a traditional similar stage venture investment, obviously there's example the big primes are a hundred billion dollar plus companies. So obviously there can be enormous companies in this area, but they're well entrenched. They've been there forever. There's been a lot of consolidation. Do you think differently about the returns, risk or return is the profile different? Katherine: There's a reason why SpaceX is the most valuable American company, private company, it is because once they hit a certain escape velocity, there are no competitors in many ways. Like these are the companies that really become dominant. The real difference is I'd say in the earliest of stages, you taking on a little bit more risk because oftentimes they tweak things that haven't been done before. They're competing against legacy incumbents if they get wind of them or worried of them, they will get squashed. But if they can get through the earliest of stages, these companies can compound for much longer.",3492
33,Katherine Boyle - Investing for America,The Anatomy of a Great Story," Patrick: Have you seen any success in a company like this where the founder isn't a great storyteller? Katherine: I love this question. I really anchor on story. There are probably some unique cases on the edges of say aerospace, where someone can be taught. Like I do think you can teach someone how to fundraise, especially at seed series A, it is just so important from a recruiting standpoint, from a capital raising standpoint. And when I say story, I'm not talking about like hype men or hype women. I mean, I'm talking about really understanding the history, really making the case that you are going to be able to survive the hard years, which are the first three years. That is just so important in being able to build the company that I've always anchored on, how well does this founder know the market? How well can this founder explain why the technology is so important to the customer? I'd say, it's not just storytelling though, the thing that Anduril really got right was just this deep empathy for the customer and understanding the customer in a way that you could, if they had not worked in government before. So I do think there has to be a historical knowledge, which might be a different facet of storytelling, but just a historical knowledge that leads to a deep empathy that can allow for a customer to really take a bet on these companies. Patrick: You're the ultimate person to ask this question given the background in journalism and also with these companies and their storytelling, what do you think the anatomy of a great story is? Katherine: The thing that I always look for is something that I call seriousness. I divide it as a unique combination of capability and will where there is just such a ferocity in the founder that they are going to run through walls, that they are going to get it done where it's not just, this is an interesting story, or this is someone who has a thesis about it, but it's someone who you just have 100% faith is grinding and working ridiculously hard to move mountains. That is something that I don't think you can necessarily quantify, but it is this will component that exists, not just in companies, it's in nation states, just seeing the ferocity of someone who has a will to get something done that I think has to be there for the story to make sense, because oftentimes the story that's being told is this has never been done for foreign, and this is going to be incredibly difficult to do. But if you don't believe that the person has the capacity to not only do that himself or herself, but also be able to recruit just extraordinary talent who are on board with that mission, oftentimes it will be impossible. The thing that often is lacking and founders who may want to take on these sort of noble missions is how serious are you about this mission? Patrick: So in some ways it's the medium and not the message that matters. It's how it's delivered and by whom as much as it is the content of the thing itself. Katherine: And not necessarily even how it's delivered, it's more about the grounding of business person serious. What is at the heart of this company? This is why we love to get involved early harder to assess that at later stages, except just to look at their growth. But I think early on, this is something that I think is so core to whether these companies can succeed. Patrick: How do you win? Let's say there's a founder that is clearly exceptional and there's 10 investors that want to be his or her partner early on. What is your story, I guess, to founders at this stage as to why you and your firm are the best partner in this category? Katherine: One of my favorite quotes is actually a Margaret Thatcher quote that I've amended where she said Europe is built on history, America is built on philosophy. In all of investing, if you can't compete on history, compete on philosophy. And I used to give this advice to people who are starting out their careers. The question of winning becomes less the obsession. Early on in a career when you're trying to work with companies like Anduril as a junior partner, someone who is really early in their career, philosophy matters to these founders in a way that perhaps in other sectors it doesn't matter as much, but I'd say these are very difficult missions. The story of Anduril is one of incredible success and people logging it now. But in 2017, when a lot of people made that investment, there was a lot of people who laughed them out of the room, said horrible things about them said that they were doing terrible things. Why would you ever build a defense company? This is not good for society. And a lot of the investors had the same thing. And so you have to be mission aligned with these companies and they have to believe your mission aligned. My advice to investors who are trying to work with these companies is if you don't have a true mission alignment with what they're doing, you're likely not the person who should be working with them. Patrick: Well, this has been so much fun. I think the broad category is just so fascinating and interesting and has had these features like this crazy cost inflation lack of progress. But I think you correctly point out that there's nothing stopping progress here. I mean, there are things impeding it, things that maybe need to change, but there's nothing that says it can't happen. I think it will take a lot of investors thinking like you are to try. So I've really enjoyed learning from you today. I ask everyone the same traditional closing question. What is the kindest thing that anyone's ever done for you? Katherine: I love this question because to me, kindness is really selflessness and the most selfless thing that anyone has ever done for me is actually happening in the other room right now. I don't know if you could hear my son screaming. Patrick: I could not. Katherine: Right now my mother is watching my 18 month old son and I am a firm believer in multi-generational living the nuclear family in many ways was actually bad for society. We used to live in multi-generational households where grandparents would help take care of children so that parents could work. When this is a modern thing where we've moved away from that. I'd say the most selfless thing that anyone has ever done for me is my mother committing her Twilight years to help us raise our child. It's one of these things where a willing grandpa or grandma is necessary in order to live in a multi-generational household. And I'm just beyond grateful that she's sacrificing her Twilight years to help us raise our child. And I will never be able to repay her, but I hope to be able to pay it forward one day. Patrick: Wonderful answer. I don't think I've had that one exactly before. I always like to add a new one to the list. This has been so much fun. Thank you so much for your time. Katherine: I really appreciate it. Thanks so much.This site uses cookies to improve your browsing experience. By using this site, you are consenting to this policy.",1620
34,Will Thorndike - The Power of Long Holding Periods,Introduction," Patrick: Our guest today is Will Thorndike. I first spoke to Will in 2017 about his excellent book, The Outsiders and his career in private equity. I titled that conversation, How Skilled Capital Allocators Compound Capital. In many ways this conversation continues where that one left off. Through the lens of his new project, a podcast called 50X, we explore the power of multi-decade holding periods and the shared characteristics of businesses that are able to compound returns at high rates for abnormally long periods of time. Please enjoy this discussion with my friend Will Thorndike and if you haven't subscribed to 50X, I highly recommend doing so.",147
35,Will Thorndike - The Power of Long Holding Periods,What Will Learned from 50X and The Outsiders," Patrick: So Will we have the benefit of being able to talk about probably five or six different things today in your life of investing and business building, but I want to begin with a project that you and I have worked a bit on together, a new podcast that you've released called 50X and a firm in support of that effort called Compounding Labs. I think people that know you really well have certainly read The Outsiders and may know a little bit about your investing career as well in private equity, as one of the primary investors in search funds, they could certainly listen to our first episode together to get a deep dive on those two things. But maybe take the idea of The Outsiders and describe to me what that work did to your mind, your investing mind, and why and how you're continuing that concept with 50X. Will: The Outsiders project was just enormously energizing for me. And it was a combination of a chance to work with a really talented group of young research partners, these Harvard Business School students, who I worked with in their second years at HBS, and the process there involved the key to those chapters was the depth of the research, the depth of the analytical work and the model that we evolved there was we had a full year, full academic year of research. In the first semester, we did a very deep analytical on each of the Outsider companies and their peer groups. And then in the second semester we used that research as the door opener to get in and have conversations with all of the living CEOs, many of whom were famously reclusive, and everyone alive who'd had anything to do with those companies. Board members, former management team members, key advisors, key employees of different business units, competitors, et cetera.It was a very rich experience. Rules we used for inclusion in the outsiders centered on performance relative to the SNP and relative to the peer group over very long periods of time. So the test was the average tenure of those eight CEOs was 20 years, and the idea was to see their performance across two full business cycles. And what it really drove home to me was just the power of really long holding periods and the impact that has on how you think about kind of every aspect of the business, both as an investor and as a CEO and management team member. I really enjoyed that process and my own investing has evolved in such a way that I'm now I retired from Housatonic, the firm I was involved founding about eight years ago. I'm now investing personally, and the common thread across the investing I'm doing is a focus on companies and projects that can be built over much longer time horizons, holding periods measured in decades plural. The ongoing curiosity in understanding companies and CEOs and investors who've been successful in doing that.And so I've been fortunate enough to partner with a group of people at Compounding Labs, three people, Kent Weaver, Jason Pananos, and Jay Davis, whom I have known for a very long time. We've invested and worked together over a dozen years now. We all share a voracious curiosity around this topic. And 50X was a natural outgrowth of that. The idea was to look at what Atul Gawande calls positive deviants in this area. And to really study in detail the most successful, and the idea for 50X is it's a 50X MOIC on your investment. That's a 20 plus percent IRR over 20 years. It's a high bar. So to look for examples of companies that had passed that test, we thought about a 100X, but that was already taken. So we settled on 50X, still a reasonably high bar. Patrick: 50's pretty good. I'd love to dig into this interest that you have in long-term holding periods in as many ways as we can. The TransDigm episode and the conversation you had with Nick and some of the investors there really brings it to life where this is not a simple story, right? There's a lot going on over a very long period of time. Obviously periods that long are fundamentally unpredictable. You don't know what's going to happen in the world. You don't know what's going to happen on the team. There's a crazy amount of unpredictability that gets injected if you're talking a 20, 30 year time horizon. So how do you deal with that amount of uncertainty and what are the benefits of having that sort of orientation? Is there a litmus test that you apply to the company to say, ""This definitely won't work over five years, but it could over 30."" Is that a positive thing? I would just love to start to understand the reason that you're so interested in this, given that as you get longer, it just seems harder to predict things. Will: In the original Housatonic fund we still owned three of the eight companies that we invested in and the holding period for each of those companies is over 25 years now. And those companies have been very good outcomes, but they've also just been incredibly fun and satisfying to work on. You asked that question about how has the book influenced my investing, part of it is I've spent a lot of time thinking about those eight companies in the book, those three companies from the earlier Housatonic funds, and then a whole range of other companies I've been involved in over a long period of time with the idea that what correlates most highly with persistence in return profile over time? This is really translated into a lot of the work that we're doing at Compounding Labs, but we've really become zeroed in on revenue quality. So the purest form of that is it a recurring revenue business? And if so, what's the churn profile?And what we've found is there's disproportionate power in truly low churn businesses. And when I say churn, I mean, logo churn, gross churn, net revenue retention is, there are other metrics that are important as well, but really at the core of it is you start the year with a 100 customers, how many do you end the year with and why are there structural reasons for that? And so if you look across those companies, they tend to have this element of revenue persistence. It's absolutely the case for TransDigm, TransDigm which I'm sure we'll get into in some detail, their business is very specialized aviation components, airplane parts. When they get engineered into these core airplane platforms, frames, whether it's the 737 commercial aircraft or the B-52 and defense aircraft, and those platforms tend to stay in active service for 70 or 75 years.So if you're providing a small, critical component part into those airframes, in order to be switched out, it requires FAA approval. It absolutely never happens. And so you have great visibility, predictability on your revenue stream around which you can then do a whole range of other things in terms of how you organize the company, whether you choose a decentralized organizational form, how you think about financing the company. It has a dramatic impact on your capital allocation menu of alternatives. So we've intentionally been trying to select for a very specific type of business model at Compounding Labs and also in the work we're doing at 50X.",1533
36,Will Thorndike - The Power of Long Holding Periods,Defining Revenue Quality and Capital Efficiency," Patrick: Maybe we could just keep digging in until we find a bottom on this concept of revenue quality. What are the most common things that you start to see early in the investigation of a business that indicate that this revenue quality that you're after may be there? And what is the process like early on as you're doing one of these deep dives, what kinds of questions are you asking of the business, or the inverse? What kind of things are you looking to actively avoid? Even if there's, let's say, low churn? Will: It's one of these things the mathematicians talk about the simplicity on the other side of complexity. And so we've spent a lot of time on this over a very long period of time, across a lot of companies. At the end of the day, however, industries that are characterized by very low churn are just interesting places to be looking for these sorts of long holding period platforms. The Porter Framework is incredibly powerful. There are a lot of frameworks you can use to evaluate businesses, but I would argue at the end of the day, if a company has 2% customer churn that's a very powerful indicator.So then you have to look at, okay, so what are the reasons for that? And what potential dislocation risk is there that the reasons for that stickiness will change over time. It's a very rich hunting ground we found, and you tend to get with that profile a lot of other good things. You tend to get relatively simple operations, you tend to get pricing power, you tend to get a high degree of capital efficiency, which is another thing we really focus on. We can talk a little bit about that. But a lot of positive economic attributes tend to correlate with those sorts of revenue profiles. It's not in and of itself the only criterion, but it's a very powerful leading indicator. At least for the work we're doing. Patrick: Say a bit more about capital efficiency. So what do you mean by that specifically? We don't have to use TransDigm, but maybe with an example to nail home the point. Will: So, basically everything I was saying TransDigm would be a pretty good exemplar of, it's a really great business. But capital efficiency the way we think about that is the metric we use is something called return on tangible capital, which is a measure of the cash generated by a business relative to the tangible assets deployed in that business over time. So the math on that, just not to bore your listeners, is we look at EBIT A, we assume that depreciation equals CapEx, which is usually a pretty conservative assumption. So we take EBIT A, we tax effect it, so we multiply it by one minus the tax rate.Historically, that's been 0.6, at the moment it's more 0.7, and you divide that by networking capital plus net PP&E. So you're removing intangible assets, goodwill from the equation. You're basically looking for 20% or better. So that's the detailed math of it, really at a more simplistic level you're looking for businesses that have low maintenance CapEx requirements.In other words, they don't need to spend a lot of capital to maintain the current volume of business. And then they aren't working capital intensive. They don't have a long receivable cycle and they don't have to carry a lot of inventory. So it really comes down to those basic things. And what it rewards is things like businesses that get paid in advance. One of the things that I think I've learned as I've gotten older is the incredible power of negative working capital. And I know you know that Patrick because some of your businesses benefit from that, but it's a really powerful thing. And this ROTC, return on tangible capital, we call it ROTC, really highlights that. So our businesses tend to be very capital efficient, which is code also for asset light. Patrick: Say a bit about an example maybe of what looks like an attractive business, but requires a lot of maintenance CapEx as a sort of counterexample. Something pop to mind there? Will: A really good business that we've invested in over time and actually done okay, and it is a bit of a counter example, so it's the data center business. So the data center business has excellent recurring revenues, but if you actually look at the mechanics of operating a data center, you're continually having to change the racking and the equipment and the power supply. There's just a lot to maintain your volume of business, you actually end up having to spend a high single digit percentage of your revenue every year to stay in place.It's a stark contrast with say the records management business, which is the business Iron Mountain dominates, where you store paper and electronic records, mostly paper records. But those records sit on racks in a warehouse, zero CapEx required to maintain them. That's actually a wonderful business on these dimensions. It's a 2% customer churn business with very low maintenance CapEx, and they're very similar businesses. The business model is similar. So one would have higher maintenance CapEx, one lower and over long periods of time again this is a compounding game, those seemingly small differences in capital intensity have a significant impact on equity returns for investors. Patrick: The other notable thing you said is tangible capital, when the world has gone the direction of intangible assets, beginning to ever more dominate the total assets, let's say, of the S&P 500 companies or something. Say a bit about that. What do you think about the measurement of intangibles and whether or not you would be avoiding great businesses that are very intangible heavy by having this calculation? Will: The way I would think about intangible assets is in the balance sheet sense of goodwill. So you want to basically eliminate goodwill, which is really an accounting convention. The intangible assets in the sense of intellectual property actually correlate very highly with this type of capital intensity. I mean, if you sort of look at the FAANG companies, there's never been a precedent for the capital efficiency of those businesses. Look at the primary equity required to create Google and Facebook versus the free cash flow they generate. Now, it's just unbelievable. There's never really been anything like it. They're incredibly capital efficient business models benefiting from intellectual property, which is itself an intangible asset, but not one that shows up systematically on the balance sheet. Patrick: And if you think about this being a compounding game and these small differences, adding up to massive numbers over time, you mentioned some other things that this high return on tangible capital, capital efficient type businesses can do that maybe a regular company couldn't. How does that show up most? Is it just more flexibility because there's more free cash being generated? What are the tangible ways that capital efficiency rolls into more capacity for compounding? Will: If you have a low churn business that's highly capital efficient, you've got predictable cash generation, which is business. A very, very powerful thing. Going back to compounding labs, we are partnering with talented young CEOs to build very long term holding companies usually focused in vertical industry niches, where they will be acquiring a number of companies over time through serial acquisition. Our approach there centers on equity efficiency as a core principle. We're trying to build those companies very substantially over a long period of time, but to do it in an equity efficient way. Much more equity efficiently than say a private equity firm would do with the same vertical industry focus. If you have those two things, that predictability from the low churn and the capital efficiency, the hierarchy, it allows you to very efficiently use leverage to build those companies via acquisition. Particularly if you're thoughtful about the pacing in the early years. One of the lessons in TransDigm - TransDigm required $25 million of primary equity. That's it. Patrick: Wow. Will: Today the business has $35 million roughly of equity market cap. It never required another dollar, and it's for this reason, the early first episode touches on this, the early chapters, basically in the first four or five years, they focused on optimizing the initial four businesses they bought in the Kelso transaction and they didn't do their next acquisition for four or five years till Odyssey came in. At that point they built the base of EBITDA very substantially, which they could then tap to the next acquisition that they did, which was also highly accretive they did with debt. No additional equity and then they were... We call that flywheel. The point after which you can do incremental acquisitions all with debt and TransDigm's an excellent example that. Nick built the flywheel really early on and it's still humming.",1926
37,Will Thorndike - The Power of Long Holding Periods,How A Long Research Process Builds Patience," Patrick: If you think about, I guess the power of that patience early on, and you're doing these very deep dive looks at companies for the outsiders now for 50 X. What are the kinds of things that you're uncovering about let's say TransDigm, since it's the most recent example. That you think would just be overlooked or underappreciated if you spent, I don't know, five hours researching the company or some shorter period of time that probably a more traditional analyst new to the company would get familiar in five, 10, 15, 20 hours, something like that. What kinds of things would they miss maybe specifically for TransDigm, but what is the value of this like crazy deep dive, year long type research that you do? Will: It's the peeling back the layers of the onion analogy. So examples of things you learned from diving deeper, pacing is one of them. You need to look really hard to get at that, but their approach to pacing was very different, very differentiated. Another item that's important to them is they've retained the ability to do really small acquisitions as they've gotten bigger. That turns out to be a common thread across really long term serial acquirers, really small acquisitions tend to be very, very accretive for these companies over time and so the trap that some serial acquirers fall into is to just focus on larger deals. TransDigm has retained the ability to do a steady diet of these smaller, highly accretive transactions. Again, all done with debt. Game selection, so to speak was really good here. Nick and his team chose an excellent industry, but within that, it's sort of optimized along every single dimension.You can look at the decision they made around organizational structure. They chose an extreme what I would call hard form of decentralization and they've been able to maintain that as they've grown. The details of that, which are in the podcast are all things you would miss on first study, but they're very important to understanding how sustainable that approach is going forward. The approach to compensation is unique among public companies and it's tied directly into the decentralized organizational form and it's just unique in ways that are sort of provocative. It's entirely performance based, no time based vesting whatsoever and it's tied to minimum thresholds of compounding for shareholders using a very sensible formula.The lessons that come out about how to instill, imprint a culture widely in an organization, sort of idea of the simplicity of the value creation triad at TransDigm, which is repeated add in for an item. It's repeated add in for an item across our podcast, but even more so within the company, this idea that's productivity, pricing and profitable new business. Those are the only possible sources of value creation and every GM is evaluated on those and every review of every business unit quarterly is centered on those. Patrick: There's two things you bring up there, coming back to my original question of why bother with super, super long holding periods where there's so much uncertainty. It seems as though game selection and then culture are two really critical things to focus on early on and things that are sustainable. Choose the right game, you can play for a long time, have the right simple, repeatable culture. It can last for a long time. Maybe we'll touch on both of those because they seem critical here starting with game selection. I'm just curious for everything that you've learned across your career now, looking at God knows how many businesses, everyone's got to choose the game they're in and I'm sure you've seen people that have done this great and those that haven't. What have you learned? What would be the career retrospective on good game selection for companies? Will: As I've gotten older, it really does come down to predictable growth in free cash flow. So really great businesses are characterized by predictable growth and free cash flow, I think generally. At least that's been the case in my investing. If I look back on the best investments I was involved with and the predictability comes from that dynamic, we talked about earlier, the tightness of the customer relationship, the stickiness around retention rates and the profitability really does come from how efficiently does the business translate EBITDA into free cash flow? That RACI metric is essential to that. Third element is growth and growth is just really, really powerful and organic growth and inorganic growth are two different things. At CL we're really focused on companies where the primary engine of value creation is inorganic growth, serial acquisition over time. That leads to a slightly different set of criteria for game selection. In core search fund investing, which I remain very active in as do my partners at CL, the core engine there is organic cash flow growth.So it's a slightly different set of criteria that you use in evaluating the perfect business there and the search community has just gotten better and better and better at refining those and the results are showing that, but growth is central. So game selection, I think centers on those three pillars that sort of triad and there's detail around it. But again, it's one of these things if you get those three things together, you get all sorts of good things along the way. They're cross correlations with a lot of other very... For instance, very few businesses that have those three characteristics don't have high EBITDA margins. Patrick: What about the customers being served or the types of customers being served? So FAA change, serving the government for a B-52 part or something is a visceral example because of how crazy the switching cost or the switching story seems, but is there a common feature of the kind of customers that tend to be served by these businesses that we've talked about that you're so focused on? Will: They tend to be business customer. B2B business, the vast majority of the time and then they tend to be providing a service, in the case of TransDigm, a product that's absolutely critical, but a very low percentage of total end cost. The beauty of the records management business is it's a minute monthly charge... I've never been able to talk to anyone who can tell me what they pay monthly, but they never move the boxes, because if the boxes they may lose the one box they need in litigation or when the regulatory agency examines- Patrick: The culture piece is the other side of this coin that I think is so interesting, those three Ps that you mentioned for TransDigm, I think of Danaher business systems, like there's lots of interesting examples of this in the public equity community. How do you think about evaluating culture and its potential to propagate forward, whether it's customer obsession at Amazon or with Danaher business system or something like that. Tell me about culture and the role that it plays in your interest in a company early on in one of these stories. Will: I think you can evaluate, you can't perfectly evaluate culture quantitatively, but I think you can look at retention rate over time in the top executive ranks. I think increasingly you can look at things like internal NPS scores Glassdoor ratings. You can get a sense of these things. I think Silicon Valley stereotype culture, which implies sort of bean bag chairs and ping pong tables. I think culture is at least in these companies, it tends to be something that is inextricably linked to the organizational design decision and not to oversimplify it, but the vast majority of these companies, and this is true for the companies we're working with at CL, are highly decentralized. They're choosing a decentralized organizational form and with that comes a very powerful sort of related culture. Sort of an ethos of entrepreneurship. The idea that the status in the organization belongs to the business unit GMs, not that people who work at corporate.",1691
38,Will Thorndike - The Power of Long Holding Periods,The Power of Conglomerates and Serial Acquirers," Patrick: You've mentioned this kind of decentralized structure a few times. An example would be helpful of people might think of Berkshire or something where there's a lot of trust and responsibility and ownership that's pushed down, maybe IAC. There's other interesting modern examples of a slim home office, not a lot of G & A the home office and a lot of responsibility at the business unit. Why does this work so well? How does culture permeate across very independent business units? It seems like that would be almost contradictory that unique cultures at the business level, if it was fully decentralized. So I'm just curious to understand a bit more about why you think this works. Will: First of all, it's not a universal panacea at all. So there are lots of companies that have been very successful with cultures and organizational structures that aren't decentralized. I would argue that Danaher has been wildly successful as a serial acquirer with a culture that is not highly decentralized. It has elements of decentralization, but also importantly, elements of centralization. It's not a universal solution at all. I think it's very industry dependent. The characteristics of successful decentralized cultures, I mean, again, you can kind of super, roughly get at it quantitatively by looking at the ratio of people at corporate to total employees, relative to the peer group. So a lot of the companies and the outsiders and the book and TransDigm as examples were just off the charts, they had 10 X, five to 10 X, as many employees, total employees per employee at corporate.With that is this idea that again, that you're trying to retain entrepreneurial ethos, that's an essential priority. So that's one of the objectives of a decentralized culture. The other is you are lowering your cost and in these cultures, there tends to be an element of frugality scrappiness in the culture. It persists long past the early days. Another company that fits this model very well is Constellation Software, which famously has 500 plus maybe 600 now business units under Mark Leonard. If you're the CEO of a company, you're constantly faced with decisions about what to centralize versus keep independent. The tricky thing is in almost every case, the decision to centralize leads to a near term economy, like a quantifiable near term cost savings.But the reality is that if you do it every time, if you follow that path to its logical conclusion, you tend to end up with a bureaucratic ossified organizational structure and culture. We talk about this with our CEOs all the time. What messes are you willing to step around? What things do you think are important to have reside at corporate and what should remain with the general managers? Patrick: I'm curious for an example of a mess that's worth sidestepping. It would seem counterintuitive that a great business would actively avoid getting involved in a mess. So what's a good example of that in your experience? Will: It's sort of, what do you want to mandate? Do you want to mandate a certain type of Salesforce compensation program at all of your companies? And it's this idea. Do you want to mandate it or do you want to suggest it? The other thing that happens in those successful decentralized companies is they tend to regularly assemble the general managers and compare their results and share ideas in a way that naturally promotes positive peer pressure or a little element of competition, but also shares good ideas. That would be an example. You have healthcare insurance, you're going to make everyone on the same healthcare insurance program or let them choose their own. Even if you get purchasing economies, what's the flip side? It's sort of looking at that non-intuitive costs of efficiency sometimes. Patrick: What have you learned if you apply a lot of these ideas to the world of software, it seems just face value that some great software businesses, maybe especially vertical market focused ones would have some of these features. Really key part of other people's business processes, very sticky, low churn, fairly asset light, and so on, low marginal cost. What do you think about software? It seems uncontroversial to say software is a good business model and we haven't talked at all about price, how much the market price is in all these great features, but what have you learned about software specifically and has your interest in that industry or business style grown? Will: Software fits this model really closely. It's become in the last 10 years, you make that specific, it's become a single most popular industry for search funds, for search fund managers- Patrick: That's interesting. Will: ...for that reason. It just fits the profile really, really well. In addition, there are lots of targets. I do think it lends itself well and if you were looking for current exemplars of this extreme approach to decentralization, as I mentioned before, Mark Leonard, at Constellation would be very near the head of the list for that. He's buying super nichey, super vertical market software companies, and then keeping their PNLs separate and running them very independently. Patrick: What do you think the key is then to this art of long-term serial acquisition? You mentioned that it's a different set of considerations from a company that might be focused on organic growth. You've invested in some of these companies through Compounding Labs, I think, already. And you're partnered with the people running these serial acquirers, I think, to help them with advice and whatever. So what is it about that style that makes it work? What do you think the best serial acquires do or focus on? Will: I mentioned pacing. And if you have a decades long time horizon, you don't have to worry so much about making a lot of acquisitions in the early years. And we tend to be backing really talented earlier career CEOs. Over the first three years anyway, we tend to go substantially slower than a private equity firm would with the same sort of general serial acquisition mandate. So pacing is part of that. But the center of what we do, Patrick, is something we call the rule of 10.As we're thinking about industries, going back to game selection, we think a lot about the rule of 10 and the rule of 10, the way we define it is it's the sum of customer churn, gross churn, plus the enterprise value to EBITDA multiple paid, and it's like a golf handicap. Lower is better. You want to be under 10 in the combination of those two things. And that's the rule we spend a lot of time thinking about as we're building out these CL companies, Compounding Lab companies. What's implicit in that is that for this type of project, serial acquirers, the predictability of the revenues we think is more important than the organic growth. We would trade high organic growth for lower churn. These companies are all growing. We want some growth, but again, the profile would be substantially less than the organic growth profile of a typical, say, search fund company. Patrick: One of the things that's super intriguing is the use of debt for acquisitions, because the obvious benefits of if you go a little slower at the beginning, have really high quality EBITDA free cash flow against which you can borrow money to do the next acquisition versus a private equity fund, the advantage for a long-term holding period is eye-popping. Say a bit about debt financing and the role that maybe a new rates environment will play in that strategy, because it's been great, really cheap way to do things for 20-30 years, but maybe that's changing. Will: We're active, prudent, but active users of debt. And we tend to be reasonably creative in how we used debt. We're open to new solutions. So we tend to have relationships with senior lenders, but also there's often some seller financing in some of our transactions. And sometimes we also work with mezzanine providers. So we use debt actively, and we spend a lot of time thinking about the right capital structure for these companies. Generally for us, the most important things are the amount of available leverage, how much is available as a multiple of EBITDA, how they define EBITDA. A lot of our businesses are businesses where we think the trailing 12 month look at EBITDA is not necessarily as accurate of you as the last quarter annualized. We're very fortunate to work with a group of very sophisticated lenders, but there's sort of a lot of detail around how we think about the right ratio of leverage.And then we spend a lot of time thinking about the covenants and how are they set and what are the different tests and so forth and so on. And we think a lot about the amortization. And so we're willing to trade higher rates for the right answers in those other three buckets, the amount of debt, the pattern of amortization, and the covenant levels. We're generally not optimizing for rate alone. In the current environment, rates are moving. At this juncture, it has yet to become a major factor in how we're thinking about capital structures for our companies. That could be the very different 24 months from now. Patrick: If you think about the lessons learned from Outsiders, TransDigm, et cetera, and the way that great capital allocators operate, the one that stands out to me is just the flexibility of the allocator. I always think of Singleton. I think that was the first chapter in Outsiders, that he was just willing to completely change his strategy if the prevailing market conditions changed, his own stock price, the price of whatever, price of debt, price of equity. How do you think that's going to affect young CEOs most today looking forward? If you were a 25, 30, 35 year old CEO with a capital allocator's mindset, do you think the future will be much different than the past that you've spent so much time studying? Will: It's an interesting question. The pattern that we see in search fund companies, and so far in CL is that in the early years, say the first three to five years, capital allocation is pretty straightforward. The excess cash generated by the business is usually paying down debt and funding organic growth in the case of a search fund, or maybe beginning to get ready to fund inorganic growth in the case of a serial acquisition consolidation platform. As those companies grow and evolve over time, the menu, the pallet of capital allocation options tends to widen.And so by the time you get out to year seven through 10, they often have a much wider array of options which can include and have included a number of our company's stock repurchases. Even in private companies, we've been able to do some of that over time, although it's much harder, obviously, in a private company than a public company, and then selectively, we have looked at dividend re... You have a broader array of alternatives, both in terms of how you source the capital. As you get larger, you're continually lowering your cost of capital and generally increasing the amount of flywheel you have available to grow the business hopefully. Most of the Compounding Labs companies just have gigantic TAM runways. I would expect that default outlet of accretive acquisitions will remain the primary cap allocation outlet for a decade plus for most of those companies. Patrick: Back on the concept of revenue quality and the recurring nature of that revenue, I didn't dig in on that word recurring, but I'd love to. One version of recurring is literal subscription. If you want access to the thing, you pay for it again every year, and that's a very common software model. But what other forms of recurring have you seen? And are there things that sort of are on the line between recurring and not? I'm trying to figure out exactly what that word means in your mind. Will: Purest form, of course, is contractual recurring revenues with long contract terms and a long history of renewal at the end of those terms. So that's the gold standard. But the reality is lots of companies have very strong recurring revenues that aren't contractual in nature, but the due diligence bar is higher for those companies. You really have to study cohort by cohort and understand what the pattern of repurchase has been over a long period of time. At the other extreme, you've got consistent businesses where there's a consistent pattern of repeat business, and those are sort of B plus on this dimension and they can qualify. I mean, I would say for the Compounding Labs work, we wouldn't likely do a deal that fit that, we wouldn't back a platform. And I'd say just generally, for me, as I've gotten older, I'm less open to high quality repeat revenue.It's sort of like TransDigm itself. Actually one of the learnings that TransDigm, you asked that question earlier, but that was fascinating is if you watch TransDigm over time, several times they bought larger companies where 75%, 80% of what they bought was pure form after market recurring business and 20% was other aviation stuff that was pretty good. And in every case, they chose to immediately divest the pretty good stuff. Even though they would've gotten the higher multiple on it, it would've added near term enterprise value and equity value, in every case, they insisted on staying. They were purists. Patrick: That's fascinating. Will: I think as we've gotten older, we've gotten more focused on the purity of, ""Why settle? Why not focus on the truly elite recurring models?""",2986
39,Will Thorndike - The Power of Long Holding Periods,Lessons From Leaders and Long-Term Investments," Patrick: What have been the biggest changes for you moving from managing outside client capital to just managing your own? You mentioned that was eight years ago, that change. So you've had some perspective in it now. What are the biggest felt changes? And is it impossible to translate maybe the benefits of doing with your own money into the client model? Will: The number one thing, Patrick, honestly has been that I stepped back from Housatonic about eight years ago. And that was coincident with some of the renewed focus and work around that's led to this even longer term... Housatonic had extremely long holding periods relative to the world of private equity, as we talked about last time. The number one thing for me has been intensified focus on extraordinarily long holding periods. Part of that is reflection on what's worked for me and what's been fun for me in the past. Part of it is just the math of that as a taxable investor. And honestly, it's the most fun projects I've been involved with have been those where we've had an opportunity to build the companies over longer periods of time.And I've always had postpartum depression when we sold our best businesses, had to because of fund life reasons. And so I also did some work on the IRRs to the next owners of businesses, really good businesses I was involved with but had to sell. And they're unfortunately really good, really consistent and really good. That further underscored the value of being able to own these things, setting things up from the outset in a way that structurally you can own them for longer periods of time. Patrick: Can you say a bit about the three companies that you mentioned that Housatonic has owned for more than 25 years and whether or not those fit into some of these themes that we've talked about today? I would just love to hear what they are. Will: Two of them were early search fund companies, two of the first 10 search fund companies. One is an amazing company called Asurion, which is possible might be a 50X candidate at some point, which we were fortunate enough to be invested in in the earliest days, run by a business school classmate of mine named Kevin Taweel and a very, very talented team. Still going very strong. In that case, it's coming up on 27 years this month. Another one is a company, also a search fund company, called Carillon, which is an assisted living business in North Carolina run by an extraordinarily talented CEO named Karen E. Moriarty. Again, still going strong. And the other is a niche cooking information business called America's Test Kitchen that we've been involved with also for a very long period of time.Those businesses would all score really well on the dimensions we were talking about. The Carillon Assisted Living, it's a little harder for that to be a pure form recurring revenue business, because you have an actuarial component to your residents, but within the world of assisted living, it has very high persistence, very high retention rates and both Asurion and the information business had extraordinarily low churn. All those businesses had excellent returns on tangible capital and they've all had great organic growth over a long period of time. Patrick: What was Karen so good at? And this is foray now into a set of questions on leaders. I know you've worked and are working with two public companies as well where you are a chair and have worked with just a crazy amount of CEOs hands on in your career. So let's start with Karen. What made her so good and for so long? Will: So Karen is really unique in that she's... So the assisted living business is operationally intensive. The degree of difficulty to operate an assisted living facility well is very high, much higher than the norm in the search fund and the other companies that we typically invest in the search fund universe or elsewhere. And she has evolved an excellent model for that. So she consistently operates her facilities at margins that are the envy of the industry, and she evolved sort of a system for that over time. She's excellent at hiring. And she has a very systematic approach to hiring, which fits that business very well. She is one of the world's leading experts on Myers-Briggs. She implements that in an incredibly rigorous way across all levels of that organization. And that's led to great consistency of results in it. So she's both an excellent operator in a difficult industry, and we've been in that company for 26 years.So she's evolved that approach over time. But then on top of that, she's turned out to be a highly rational surgical capital allocator. She's used her balance sheet very effectively. So assisted living is actually on its face, not super capital efficient. Karen's approach to it, Carillon was a Greenfield approach. We were building facilities, but the way she ran it was incredibly equity efficient. We were able to use debt in a very creative way there to finance new facilities, the ownership of the land, and using mortgage debt to do that. So she's generated terrific equity returns over a long period of time. And then she's just been very savvy in the way she's used her balance sheet, both to build new facilities and to make occasional distributions in a tax efficient way to shareholders and then occasionally to sell facilities and sell the spec transactions and her timing around those. So she's got both sides, both country and rock and roll. She's proven to be a really effective operator and a terrific capital allocator. Patrick: What about this crossover, public and private? This has been a really popular topic of conversation for, I guess, all CEOs. Everyone has to make this choice, if they should be lucky enough to have to make this choice, I guess, at some point. What do you think are the primary virtues of one and the other? And what have you learned being as involved as you are with a couple public companies? Will: There's some real costs to being public. One of the primary costs is the time you need to spend on investor relations, which for the typical public company CEO is around 20% of their time, sort of the day a week. One of the commonalities across the Outsiders CEOs is they made a conscious decision to allocate a lot less time than that to IR. And then there's some actual, real financial cost to being public. And a question around how you can, in public form, afford to run your company in a really long term fashion. So I think a way to think about it is if you're public, what does it force you to do differently? The same company, the same set of revenues, and cash flows, do you have to run the company any differently in public form than you would privately? And the Outsider CEOs basically found a way to minimize the frictions of being public. So it was as close to being private as possible, but that's not easy to do. That's non-trivial to do that. The companies I'm involved with, I'm involved with two public companies in a pretty intimate role, one is a company called CNX Resources, which is an energy company, a natural gas company and CEO there, Nick DeIuliis is excellent and he's spent a lot of time and we've spent a lot of time freeing him up to spend less time on investor relations over time so that he can spend more time on the activities that really drive value in the business. And the other company I'm involved with is company called Perimeter Solutions, which I'm actually involved with with Nick. Nick and I are the co-chairs there and we're early days there, but we're intentionally following a model not surprisingly very similar to TransDigm and how we're setting that up.I'm confident we'll be able to also have that run in a way very similar to how we'd run it privately. And there's some real benefits to being public. You have at least one and maybe two capital allocation alternatives that you don't as easily have privately. The first sort of indisputably is it's much easier to repurchase your shares. And on top of that, your shares trade in a more volatile fashion. You have more of an opportunity to add value by select occasional market dislocations through that capital allocation alternative than you do privately. The second thing is you also have the ability to sell stock at high multiples in an easier, more seamless fashion. So, every now and then, you can create a lot of value by selling shares at really high values. That's something that's lost on people who read the book, but Buffet at General Re and General Dynamics, when they purchased Gulfstream, created enormous value, because they did those acquisitions all with stock that was priced at an all time high multiple. It was very accretive as well and it's a bit easier to do that. And then the other thing about public company form is it's truly permanent capital. Patrick: If you think about the function of Compounding Labs itself and what that thing can grow into or should grow into, how do you think about that? I'm tempted to apply some of the same concepts of you want the home office to be pretty slim. But if you think about Compounding Labs, the thing, the company, the entity, what does great look like? What do you want it to become? Obviously, you want to make great investments, but what's behind that? Will: What we hope that looks like is we hope that we're partnered with a group of exceptionally high talent CEOs, which is true so far for us. Building companies over multi decade time horizons, in a highly equity manner, and just conducting ourselves. One of the benefits of those really long time horizons is that you can have a different lens on every aspect of the business. How you think about talent, how you think about building your team, the pacing, as we talked about, the long term investments you can afford to make in the business, how you conduct yourself with service providers and how you conduct yourself with sellers, are very different than the way you might think about each of those one-off decisions in a different setting, like a typical five year private equity time horizon investment. So, we hope that we're conducting ourselves in ways that this activity could go on for many decades. The other partners are substantially younger than I am, so I hope that I've got two, two and a half decades left. I'm 58, but the other partners are in their early '40s and early '50s. So, I hope we've got at least four decades of building and hopefully longer than that. Hopefully, it'll persist much longer than that, but that's sort of the visible horizon. Patrick: As you think about targets for these same sorts of 50x outsider, deep dive explorations, what is at the top of the wishlist, whether it's started or not? Because it seems like each of these things, I guess nine now, if you count TransDigm, has led to these incredibly rich lessons, which then factor over into your investing activity. And you have to believe there's a lot more than that you can still learn. What sorts of things do you want to learn? What sorts of companies are you craving to explore? Will: It's a good question, Patrick. We have a long list of candidates across a range of asset classes, actually. I think an important thing to mention about 50x is the primary difference between it and the outsiders and the TransDigm series is a good example of this, is we're hoping to pair the CEO perspective, which was predominant in the book with the long term investor perspective. We think there's power in those two things. We paired Nick Howley with Rob Small, founding managing partner at Stockbridge, longtime private equity investor, and really talented and thoughtful investor and company builder. But the twin perspectives we're hoping to have across most of the companies that we will dive in on. And so, this is as you know, very much in discussion at the moment, but I think we'll have an organic story and another inorganic story. So, company specific, multi decade, deep dives, before we move into ranging more widely than that. Full disclosure, the depth of work that we hope to do and that we were able to do at TransDigm, means that our frequency will not be high, frequency will be low, and sporadic, and unpredictable. So, our very clear analog is Outstanding Investor Digest, which you may be too young to remember. Patrick: I only know it because of you having told me about it. Will: Yeah. This wonderful publication that published deep in depth interviews with investors, but came out very sporadically and had sort of a cult following. So, we're likely to at least have that unpredictable frequency, because we're going try to do deep dives and then make the materials available in the show notes and in the links. Patrick: If you had to do one or two of these on companies that really don't fit the criteria that we've laid out in terms of revenue, quality or B2B, or the several things you've mentioned, what companies pop to mind that you would still be fascinated, despite it maybe not meeting your personal investing criteria to still spend a crazy amount of time understanding and learning about? Will: We may unpack investments that are even substantially shorter term trades that meet that bar. So, it's not necessarily just going to be unpacking long term company building, that will be the majority of what we do. But we're excited to range more widely than that, so you may find us popping up in entirely different asset- Patrick: Interviewing John Paulson or something. Will: Yeah, different asset classes. The key is going to be access. We feel like it's important that we can talk to principals. I think in some cases, we hope this is maybe the case of TransDigm, we want to be content of record on some of these amazing stories. And that hopefully that will appeal to a certain sort of CEO who maybe hasn't told their story in depth before, CEO or investor. But the clay is still very wet in 50x.",3113
40,Will Thorndike - The Power of Long Holding Periods,The Value of Conviction and Curiosity," Patrick: If you think about the other side of this coin, obviously the focus of the outsiders, like you said, was on the CEOs, the people running the businesses and their partners, more share this time given to the investors. One of the things that you and Rob talked about that I find fascinating is the development of investor conviction over time and how important that is to great investing stories. We've really talked about great business stories today, and usually a great business story can be a great investing story too, but the investor by definition has less information. They have less time to spend on something. Conviction is very different, than it is for a CEO. What have you learned about? Obviously, you've had to develop conviction yourself too. This seems like a topic no one really talks about. What have you learned about the development of conviction long term for investors? Will: It's super interesting question and I really it's at the center of 50x. I think we really want to dive in. And if you look at TransDigm, in simple retrospect, it looks like a amazing company that was super straightforward to just buy it and hold it forever. But there were three, maybe four existential crises along the way, 9/11, and what that did to the aviation industry. They had a company specific 60 minutes investigation they had to go through. COVID, this is an aviation company. COVID, I mean, you could never have anticipated COVID. Stock got cut in half in two weeks. And so, how did Nick behave as the CEO of the company, and then what did Rob do? And the fascinating thing about Rob is he's super thoughtful and he runs a concentrated portfolio and TransDigm has been a large, generally the largest position for him over time. But he's meaningfully added to it at different junctures over time, usually in combination with these crises. That part of the story, really interesting. We'll be looking for similar cases like that, where people, in order to earn the very high MOIC, they had to make decisions to hold that weren't obvious at the moment. Patrick: You've obviously not, I don't think, set out in your career to be a big producer of media. You've written one of the most popular books on investing and now you're entering a foray into the more modern media of podcasting. What have you learned about producing what for you is great media? And obviously, I recognize that there's lots of different ways of exploring topics. Your preferred way is extremely deep dives and then synthesis of that data and information. What would you say you've learned? Even if you're a reluctant media creator, you've nonetheless created some really great content about company building and investing. What have you learned through doing that a few times now? Will: Well, honestly, Patrick, I think following your example to a degree. I mean, a lot of this is, and this is true for all of us at Compounding Labs, we're trying to first satisfy our own curiosity and we're following that curiosity. We're going to embrace tangents if we find them interesting. And we realize that may limit our audience to about eight people, but we're going to track these things. Patrick: Not so far. Will: We're going to track these things down. And the authenticity of following legit, honest curiosity, that's generally what has driven the project so far. Also, the super low frequency, slow pace, those things are related. Patrick: It's surprising to me how under-tapped people's curiosity is as an energy source, like it's such a good one. It never burns out. Definitely, highly recommend figuring out what does that for everyone listening and find some way to capture it and something like this. As you think about the process itself of these deep dive research projects and working with, I guess I'll call them lead analysts. I think about the HBS students that helped you do each of the outsider companies, the people that will help you, Miles and others do research on the 50x companies, what could you teach us there because this process seems really valuable? Someone who has lots of experience in business and investing, coaching, mentoring, working with younger researchers to create one of these event studies, what has worked and what hasn't worked in those interactions? I know that's a random, strange nuance question, but it seems like, sure it would be great if somehow we had a pairing doing research like this on every company in the world, there'd be a lot to learn. So, what have you learned about that process? Will: Miles Wood has been working very actively on 50x, TransDigm and the next episode we're working on and has been unbelievably great with Kent Weaver and I on this project. And Miles's following, I was fortunate enough, as I mentioned, to have these eights HBS students, second year students who I work with on the chapters in the book. Honestly, I think it's a function of finding young people who share the zest for these topics, the voracious omnivorous characteristic. And so, in talking to potential researchers to work with on these projects, I always ask them what they read and what they're listening to. And there's a very high correlation with the way they answer that question and probability that they'll be a good fit for this work. Patrick: For my last question, I just want to ask about the world for at large, and how, what seems to be a very higher variance, I guess, world today than maybe existed 10 or 20 years ago, affects all of what we've talked about. So, it seems as though we've had the luxury, especially in the US of being really able to focus on individual companies and not worry too much about inflation, and rates, and wars, and all of these other bigger exogenous things that could really directly affect companies, COVID. And now, we seem to be in a different situation in a different kind of world. One, do you think that's right? And two, if so, how do you adjust your thinking and your investing for a more complicated world? Will: Yeah. I think the world, it's more unpredictable than it's ever been. I mean, my general approach, Patrick, on this is I just fundamentally don't believe I have any edge in thinking about macro topics whatsoever. It's just too complicated. And I'm almost always bearish and I've actually never been more bearish than I am right now, but honestly, I don't let that affect my investing behavior, fortunately. It's a daunting list of secular problems that we face at the moment. That being said, I think if you just focus on the quantitative outputs of all that uncertainty, it's inflation and interest rates that are most likely to hit us as investors, and there are other things. But it'll evidence itself to a degree and those things.So, thinking then about it that way, it's sort of like, what businesses do you want to be in if bad things happen in those two areas, high inflation, high interest rates? But you want to be in businesses that have pricing power, that are not capital intensive. I don't mean to diminish it by saying that, but really, no kidding, those are the two most important attributes in a business if you're heading into an environment like that. And I think the businesses we're talking about are relatively well set up for those contingencies. Not that they won't suffer in an economic downturn, but I think they'll be relatively well positioned and relative to other businesses for those sorts of environments. But it's scary. Patrick: Why do you think you're always bearish? What is it that for a long time has made you bearish? Will: It's really hard to make the bullish case, at least it is for me. They're always daunting... In the background, there is the warming of the climate, and there's secular trends that are inarguable. I really just tune it out and don't let it affect my investing behavior. I mean, I'm as busy now as I've ever been, looking at new investments. And if I did, looking back in hindsight, thank goodness, I haven't let it influence my investing behavior. Collectively, I put it in the two hard buckets, so it worries me. It worries me, but I have no ability to control it or impact it. I try to put it to the side and focus on the company's company by company. Patrick: Well, Will, I have learned just an absolutely tremendous amount from you over the years, both talking and reading and consuming the things that you've created. I'm so glad that you're doing more of it and exploring some of these interesting companies. There's plenty of people exploring Apple and Microsoft and the fan companies, et cetera, and to do it, and some of these long stories, it's just so valuable and so interesting. So, I so appreciate the chance to work with you and speak with you today. And thank you so much for the lessons you taught us all over the years. Will: Thanks for having me on, Patrick. It's a complete delight to work with you on 50x. So, I'm enjoying that very much. Thanks for having me on.This site uses cookies to improve your browsing experience.

41,Alok Vasudev - Searching for White Space,Introduction," Patrick: My guest today is Alok Vasudev. Alok is an early stage investor who has been in the crypto space for a very long time. Before co-founding Standard Crypto, he was an investor at Benchmark and S28 Capital. Given Alok's experience and the prevailing mood right now in crypto, this is a particularly interesting discussion on the ecosystem at large. We discuss whether the bubble can be thought of as productive speculation, his views on skeptics in the space, and look at some big potentially underestimated ideas. Please enjoy my conversation with Alok Vasudev.",130
42,Alok Vasudev - Searching for White Space,A View of the Current Crypto Ecosystem," Patrick: So Alok, I think the benefit of this conversation today is the very long experience and perspective that you bring to our topic. And it's also a good time to be talking about crypto, because it's finally in a season where there's a lot that's gone wrong. There's been some extremely epic meltdowns in different parts of the ecosystem. I think the general tenor is very bearish and very skeptical and a lot of worry out there, and so it's a good time to have a conversation like this. Maybe you could just tell your story a little bit. I want to give frame of reference for those listening why you're different and interesting voice having come to this a lot earlier than most and I think having a unique way of thinking about the ecosystem and its potential. So maybe just give us a little bit of history lesson on your own experience here, and then we'll go into 30 different topics. Alok: I've been in venture for just about 10 years now. I started as a generalist venture guy. I was at Benchmark is where I started my investing career. Like any young person in venture, your job is to find white space. And at the time this was... SaaS was already big in early stage venture, consumer internet was raging, marketplaces were raging. Part of it was hunting for what's new, what's on the horizon, where can I plan a flag and build the type of reputation that can set me up to compete at the highest level? Open source was an interest of mine and consumer was a big interest of mine, because we did a lot of great work there at the firm.And Bitcoin when I first encountered it was this hybrid of the two. In some sense, it's a community, it's a consumer facing product, it's money that you can hold and use, but it's built on an open source network, it's an open source protocol. I think those are probably the two veins that at least made me consider it as something I should decide to spend more time on or not. And it clicked. It was one of these things where you saw it, you understood it, and you realize that it was a disruption on so many dimensions. It was a monetary disruption, it was a technology breakthrough. It was a values disruption in terms of how we actually build organizations and the idea that decentralization could actually work in this configuration, whereas every other pressure in the world that you had was pushing towards centralization.And also, there was a roadmap for how blockchains and the tech that underpinned it could become this fabric that you could do so much more on top of if you understood what was happening, understood where it could be upgraded or changed or improved, you could see compute being built on these blockchains, you could see all sorts of mind bending stuff built with it. Part of it was right time, right place. I think part of it was also having a text and upbringing where I think you have a default skepticism towards institutions, but I think you get in a place like Texas that you wouldn't get in other places. It fit me like a glove, and I never really look back.I think that over time you always go through your own moments where you question your beliefs, you question what's going on, and crypto's cyclicality certainly does that to an extreme degree. But once you go through one or two or three or four of those, you realize that these things just start to rhyme. They're a part of what happens, they're unavoidable, but you also find they're necessary to some degree. And now here we are, we're in another version of the same thing, where I think a lot of the same factors are a play. Different reasons, different names, different specifics, but the broad structure I think holds today as it did in 2018 and 15 and 12. Patrick: You said something interesting there, which is your job as a young VC is to search for white space. What lessons could you offer about that kind of search abstracted away from crypto if you're talking to young investors out there? Not just VCs, any investor's probably job is to look for unturned rocks, white space, however you want to call it. What do you think it is to be great at searching for white space, just in general? Alok: That's a great question. Well, almost definitionally, it needs to be weird or non-consensus because that's your only chance. For me it was, I looked around my partnership room, I show up I'm a 28 year old who's never done venture before, and I look around my first partner meeting and Bill Gurley, Matt Kohler, Mitch Lasky, Peter Fenton, were the four GPs at the time. These guys were at the top of their games, how am I going to bring something to the table? Am I going to find a better open source company than Peter? Maybe, but it's not going to be structural. Better consumer company than Matt? Et cetera. It's almost like, ""Well, what else can I do,"" other than try to find weird stuff that may have a chance to work?It also helped that I came from a background in science and physics. I did my PhD at Stanford and double E, and I worked on applied physics research. And so I was curious about things that happened to actually work out. Synthetic biology, a lot of what was called frontier tech back when that was a meme, I think was natural for me to poke around in. I think it's about curiosity, it's about putting yourself in places where you're the only VC. That's a huge one. The number of VCs that I see go to networking events where there are 30 other junior VCs there. Again, almost by definition, if a bunch of other VCs are hanging around the same scene, then it's probably not weird enough or new enough. And so I always prided myself when I'd go to a meet up or go to an event and there was not another VC in sight, because meant that I was actually doing something that had the chance to actually be original. Patrick: If I asked that crew of four, sort of its own mini Mount Rushmore of sorts. If I asked that crew about the time they spent with you and what you were best at, what do you think they would say? Alok: Oh, that's hard to answer. I would say they could probably tell you a lot of things I was bad at. Patrick: Those are interesting, too. Alok: Always had a curiosity to me. And I think that led me to crypto. I think that I was pretty early Bitcoin crypto evangelist there. I would say that kind of intelligence, curiosity, being able to follow it. I can program a little bit, too. I had tried some things using that to source deals that we hadn't done before. Patrick: What about the inverse? What do you think that you were bad at back then that you've learned a lot from because you were bad? Alok: I was an awful employee. Patrick: Okay. How so? Alok: I'm bad at taking orders, bad at following instructions. I find that also I tend to gravitate towards things that give me energy, things that actually, say, shape my own personal curiosities. My big learning of my career is basically just find ways to do more of the things that naturally excite you and give you energy. For example, when you're thinking about Bitcoin and crypto all day, there are a number of other companies that you look over and you're like, ""That's black and white compared to this full, vibrant color over here, and all you want to do is spend more time there."" It was just like making sure that situations where it doesn't feel like work, and the more of that you make your work, the better off you are. Patrick: If you fast forward all the way to now, you mentioned these four or five cycles already that you've lived through in the world of crypto. I would say to sum up this skeptical view, it's something like, ""Yeah, we get it, this is great. This is a new compute platform or database platform of sorts. There is a novel technology story here that started with Bitcoin, but we're getting impatient around where the use cases all are."" And again, I'm trying to be like perfect summary of the skeptic's view that aren't tied back in some way to speculation on assets that move up and down in some price return setting. So like, ""Yeah, there's some BFI exchanges that have been really successful, and there's these JPEGs,"" the skeptic would say, ""that are really successful trading instruments. But like at the end of the day, this is just a unregulated casino."" And to be clear, I don't believe a lot of this stuff. I do think that's the current summary is, a lot of these great sounding things are just learning the lessons that the traditional finance community learned over the last 200 years and the failures like Celsius are like three arrows or whatever, are just the same lessons learned again. How would you, in a broad sense, address that generic skeptic out there in midway through 2022? Alok: It's tough, because the skepticism, it's taken on so many different shapes and forms over the years. And to some degree, I think a lot of us within crypto have a sense of frustration with the skeptic one, because I don't think we have the quality of skeptics that we deserve. I think we get people that use the same crappy arguments for years and years and years. I also think there's a tendency to move the goal posts back when it comes to this like, ""Oh, crypto hasn't done anything. What are the use cases?"" And then somehow anything that we say is not legitimate enough, and that keeps being pushed back. But when you zoom out and you think about from 2012 to where we are now, we've dramatically expanded the capabilities, we've dramatically expanded what we're able to do with it. At one point it was ""These tokens don't do anything."" It's like, well, now we have token operated protocols that generate hundreds of millions in cash flow with 90% plus FCF margin, that use case is not legitimate enough for it to be valid in the eyes of some.So I think that's why there's this base level frustration. I also think there were these moment in time things where there are moments when the overtone windows, so to speak, expands and new ideas can be introduced into the general population. And there are moments where that just can't happen. Satoshi had a great line in one of the old Bitcoin forums where someone was arguing about some mayor to Bitcoin. And he says, ""If you don't believe me or don't get it, I don't have time to convince you. Sorry."" I feel like to some degree, that's an approach that many within crypto have taken, because it's like, ""I don't know if we're going to be able to ultimately address every form of this, we're just going to keep doing our thing. And over time you can keep moving your goal post back to the point where it's absurd, or you can just die on the hill.""I mean, that was a rant about skeptics in general, we've done so much in the space and it started... The core idea for a blockchain is it is a community operated computer. And I think a big problem that we spaced, it was one of the best and worst things that happened, is that we really had this currency overtone that I think really created a lot of the path dependence for how people from the outside view the space. And I think there are a couple traps that people fall into, like for example, people think cryptocurrency is this catchall, and they think that somehow these are all currencies competing with one another. And you look at coin market cap on the top 25, and these things might as well be the Euro and the US dollar, and the pound and all these things. And that's just the wrong mental model for it.A better mental model is, you look at it like the S&P 500, and you say that each of these things is actually unique. It has unique fundamentals, it has its own unique addressable market. There's obviously competition, there's obviously overlap, but if you don't think about these things as individual entities that actually have their own first principles with which you should understand them, then you're missing basically the first step for understanding this stuff. Patrick: Do you think that it's most appropriate, just to piggyback on the S&P 500 thing, to think about, I'm sure not all, but many of these projects or networks as cash flow producing entities? Like you mentioned one that's operating with very high free cash flow margin. Maybe you could give us your favorite example of something that's sustained itself and is producing a flow of something back to its owners. Is that the right way to conceive of these things that it's just a different kind of stock effectively? Alok: Yeah. For some, absolutely. I think a lot of the defi protocols, that can be a really appropriate way to think about them. MakerDAO is an example. I'm going to gloss over some of the nuance with it, but ultimately MakerDAO, it's a stablecoin issuer. It issues Dai, a decentralized stablecoin. And there's a set of smart contracts that live on Ethereum that basically determine that issuance of Dai. You can post collateral into the Maker smart contract, and then you can borrow the stablecoin against it, subject to some collateralization ratio. And Maker the protocol generates income, there's a fee charged to people that borrow Dai, when they repay their loan there's a fee that they pay, and that fee is revenue to the protocol. And the protocol actually can take that revenue, and it's called a buy and burn.So it goes and buys back its own tokens, the MKR token, which is kind of the unit of ownership for this protocol, it goes back and buys them on the market and it burns them, it destroys them. You can kind of think of it like a share buyback,. Where it's a form of directly converting an income stream into value to holders of that asset, of the MKR token. In that case, it's really simple to think about modeling out future cash flows and thinking about those to inform how you'd value the MKR token. Patrick: Let's take that example. Tell me about the pool of demand for Dai itself. So if this is a ecosystem that creates a sort of cash flow for the maker owners, and you could model it like you described, at the end of that chain is a demand of people that want Dai and want to do something with it, so tell me about that. What is the end use case for Dai itself? Alok: Well, Dai's a stablecoin, and so I think stablecoins are one thing we can point to as really one of the strongest forms of product market fit that we've had within crypto, especially over the past couple years. It's about demand for this form of a dollar that lives natively on a blockchain that you can send 24 hours a day. Most of the stablecoin market right now are centralized stable points like USDC and USDT. I'm sure your audience knows this well at this point, but you have a dollar deposit in the bank account and for every dollar deposit in the bank account, a company can issue one token that's backed one to one by that dollar. And we call those centralized stablecoins. And those are the lions share of stablecoin demand, and so decentralized stablecoins are basically a subset of the broader stablecoin market for users who care deeply about their stablecoin having one particular property, and that particular property is it not having this singular risk of the company that issues the coin getting shut down.",3506
43,Alok Vasudev - Searching for White Space,Understanding Stablecoins and Protocols," Patrick: What about collateral is interesting to you, so that a digital programmable dollar is indeed a very interesting thing? There's obviously demand for it. I want to talk about what might happen if the US or Janet Yellen were to digitalize the dollar and whether that's a stablecoin competitor. But first maybe since there's been some fairly noteworthy blowups in this space more recently and everyone wants to talk about Tether all the time, just give us a little history lesson here. What matters most to you in the world of stablecoins, the idea of algorithmic stablecoins I think, again, to return to our skeptic, I would say it's just something to be dismissed. They're just going to inevitably blow up for some reason or another. They're not collateralized or something, maybe just give us a crash course here. Alok: Right now, there's this idea that if you want to find a good startup idea, just look at the Vitalik's blog, just build something that he wrote about. And that's a pretty good startup idea. My favorite kind of OG version of that is, so if all great up startup ideas are in Vitalik's blog, the actual upstream of that is the Bitcoin talk forms from like 2010 through 2013, because pretty much every-Like 2010 through 2013, because pretty much every idea in crypto first existed on the Bitcoin talk forums way back in the day, including stablecoins. The first time I encountered a design for a stablecoin was Robert Sam's came up with the senior shares model for a stablecoin and he was a Bitcoiner, and it was out of that kind of Bitcoin community where it came from. We've since seen flavors of that design over and over again and every single time it's had the same unsoundness. Right? So I would say that people often throw... I think right now, like algorithmic stablecoins that concept is floated as being fundamentally unsound. That's the wrong lens. I think if you discard all algorithmic stablecoin you really are throwing the baby out with the bath water to some degree. I think it's this combination of algorithmic monetary policy with unsound or insufficient collateral where things go bad.Whereas, I think you can have algorithmic monetary policy on top of a more structurally sound collateral base and it works fine. There's one that we work with called Reflexer and their coin is called RAI. And it's exactly that, it's algorithmic monetary policy but with a base of structurally sound collateral. So far that's operated as intended. So if I'm just building out kind of a two by two matrix here of good collateral, bad collateral, algorithmic governance, algorithmic monetary policy, and monetary policy set by humans, you can think about MakerDAO as an example of it's sound collateral but humans actually do the governance because it's the collective of the Maker token holders that can vote to actually establish rates within the system.And then you have all of these senior shares models of which UST was a flavor of that live in this algorithmic monetary policy with unsound collateral. And then things like Reflexer RAI are algorithmic monetary policy that live with sound collateral. Patrick: Can you just describe what sound and unsound collateral, what those terms mean? Alok: Yeah. So it relates to the amount and what it is specifically. When you have no collateral or less collateral than you're borrowing against that's on sound. And the other one that it's especially important in some of these crypto designs is this idea of exogenous collateral versus endogenous collateral. Exogenous meaning this asset is really independent of the core stablecoin mechanism. So for example, if you are MakerDAO and you have ETH as your collateral. ETH is not wound up within Maker's mechanism directly and so it's exogenous. Whereas if MakerDAO had NKR as collateral, if its own governance token was a form of collateral, that would be endogenous. If that collateral went bad, there's kind of this systemic spiral that would take the whole thing down together. When you have exogenous collateral, that's kind of appropriately inappropriate amount, that's how I think about soundness. Patrick: And are there examples where, back to this idea that like, why is there demand for this seems like the ability to move dollars around is just something in high demand is very simple. Why does the US government not just digitalize the dollar and make it... If they were to digitalize the dollar what couldn't they do that a great well collateralized US dollar stablecoin would still allow people to do? Alok: I mean, there's certainly an agility and pace of innovation angle to it. I think that we've seen that the private sector can do that pretty well. There's a lot they could do with it just because they have the ability to make it so and kind of enforce it. Patrick: They've got the guns. Alok: It's funny, it's even hard to walk too far down that hypothetical just because it feels so implausible at this point. There is a clear vector for the government to enforce policy and constraints around stablecoins. We've already seen whitelist, blacklists, things like that for the at scale stablecoins that reflect things like OFAC compliance and reflect the will of the government. So I don't know if kind of building it all the way up from scratch, I don't know if a consensus is even possible within the government to implement something like that.There's also some evidence that the government views stablecoins as is as positive and as a vector for dollarization around the world, which obviously has positive implications from a foreign policy and geopolitical standpoint for us. There was a tiny article, didn't get much play, but there was a South American government in exile that I think we were supporters of and at some point they needed an aid payment and it was actually implemented in stablecoins. For me, it was like, huh, this is the first time that we've actually seen our government using stablecoins to accomplish something. And so to me, that was like, I think there may be some voices in policy rooms that kind of agree that, hey, this is a really powerful way for the dollar just to spread. We have anecdotal evidence that this is actually the most successful form of a dollar to many people all over the world. Patrick: Yeah. I want to go back to this interesting definition you said earlier, which is that this is just a community operated computer, that's a bit different than maybe some of the earliest definitions I encountered, which is more of like a ledger or a database of who owns what assets, a way of achieving decentralized consensus around who owns what, if I'm to trust anybody. The community operated computer sounds like it's more general than that earlier definition. What do you think that means? It's a nice, elegant idea. We've got lots of computers. We've done a lot with them. It's been great. What is a community operated in that phrase unlock that a computer on its own can't make possible? Alok: In computers we have computers that are general purpose like a server within AWS or your PC. And we have computers that are domain specific or application specific like your calculator or your Fitbit. I think about Bitcoin it's a domain specific computer. It's a blockchain computer that really has one job and its job is to keep track of Bitcoin balances and make sure that you can send them around and that there's integrity in all the procedures involved. And then you have something like Ethereum, that's more general purpose in nature. It's still operated on the same fabric by the same principles. There's ultimately this decentralized consensus that needs to form on whether the computer's operating properly. But what you can do with it is you can do anything you want with it. You can write applications that do arbitrary things. That's been my frame for some time. To me, it's the right one that if you kind of believe that these are a fabric that you can do much more with.You can think about so what does like community operated computer mean? You start by your own computer on your desk or at your laptop, it's a computer owned and operated by you. You decide what software you install on it. You decide when it's on. You decide when it's off. And then you think about a cloud computer like Amazon Web Services and it's owned and operated by company. They choose what software it runs. They choose who can access it. They choose when it's on, when it's off, et cetera. And then a blockchain computer is the same thing, but it's owned and operated by users. The Bitcoin computer, those policies. What does the software do? What do upgrades look like? Is it on or off? All of that is set by a combination of social and economic incentives in this fuzzy way by the people that own and operate it. Hopefully that kind of elaborates a bit on what I meant by it.In terms of what does a community computer get you as a desirable property? It gets you unbelievable resilience. Bitcoin, as a computer has been up since 2009. I can't think of another computing service that's even had that longevity before. So, it's remarkable to me that we have a program, we have a computer that can just running up for that long. It's kind of staggering when you think about it in that way. Ethereum, similarly, a computer that's been running for years. I think that's one property that's really unique about these things. When we think about building these protocols, these immutable building blocks that we expect to live on for a really long time, the fact that you actually have a computer that can live forever, which means you can write programs that will run forever. That's something that's mind blowing that we've never seen before.I think other things you get are you get the dynamism of open source, the dynamism of communities forming and innovating and able to kind of express views and innovate in weird emergent ways that's harder to get when you have systems that are more closed off. All the beauty that you get in the open source software world as applied in a much more full stack way. Patrick: Thinking about the resilience and uptime specifically, just to keep kind of pushing on that same thread, that does seem completely unique. What kinds of things does that unlock? The persistence and reliability of those two examples, which has been true, what does that allow for, again, some other computer wouldn't allow for as a class? I'm trying to hone in on like the sort of class of objectives that this sort of computer unlocks for the first time. And I know there's lots of examples we'll get to in terms of things that it's been used for in the last couple of years that are interesting and even like the stuff at the most cutting edge frontier today. But if you think about it as like a category of capability, what do you think resilience and persistence and the uptime allow for that's new? Alok: There's a class of uses that's previously been hard for computers to natively access, the basics of crypto and money and finance. The fact that I can hold this object that ultimately is lives on a computer. For me to hold an object that lives on a computer as a form of money with all the properties of durability, longevity, these things are just fundamental attributes of money. If you can't make really strong guarantees about the resilience of this computer, how on earth can you have a monetary asset rooted in one of these things that people can actually form a basis of belief in? So, that's one really like down the middle example.Related, you can kind of grow from there to think about now like uses of that monetary asset. You can have financial rails that you can count on. Even stablecoins, if people didn't deeply believe in the resilience of the Ethereum blockchain, then I think that would undermine belief in pulling stablecoin and using them and using them to pay people, using them as assets that you really place a lot of belief in. And I think that even NFTs things like that, we're getting things like art. Things where like a really important property is its durability and its ability to be lendy and last across generations. And now we have a piece of artwork that lives on a blockchain that you can say I'm going to hang onto it for 100 years. I'm going to hang onto it 200 years. I'm going to pass it down to my children and it's viable because the substrate lives on can viably live for that long. Patrick: One of the things that I've talked a lot with our mutual friend, Gabe Leydon about specifically is Ethereum as this kind of crazy payment rail of its own. You don't need look any farther than some of the record setting like NFT purchases or whatever to see this in action. But I would constantly ping him with like this skeptical, how long can this really last, isn't this just nonsense? And he came back to me one time, he was like, how many times do you need to see this happen before you're convinced that this is wild? That there is something that's unlocked by the ability to send this much money, converted back into dollar terms or something this quickly to facilitate a transaction of this size. Let's set aside what's being bought and whether it's worth that or something, but just like the literal act itself, that's not happening elsewhere in the consumer world in the consumer sense. Obviously you can send lots of money, different ways. I found that interesting of just like, wow, okay. So if there is this growing trust in Ethereum, is it as a payment rail the thing that no one's talking about enough. What are those big ideas like that one in your mind today that people are maybe overlooking? There's evidence that it's already there, it's already operating, it's already happening and people are underestimating the potential impact. In the way I would frame it with Ethereum is what if in two years we see a $5 billion transaction that happens in an instant and it's because of Ethereum. Seems possible based on what we've seen today. Are there other things like that out there where you feel like something's going on, people aren't talking about it, they're not aware of it, they're not aware of the potential implications if we extrapolate it forward? Alok: I think the payments use case is almost going to be perpetually underrated just because we've known about it for so long, it's there. But I still think that it's just going to be underrated because it's so staggering in terms of what you can do, but it's also like we've already talked about it, let's move on. Even the way to frame people have oriented around how many transactions per second can you send, or can I do Visa scale transaction volume on a blockchain? And that's always been where the comparison is. But I always thought the money bandwidth concept is really interesting. Think about bandwidth, it's kind of a combination of it's two dimensional or how much can you send over a given unit of time? The money bandwidth of blockchain is crazy. You could send billions of dollars in 10 minutes. That's unprecedented.To Gabe's point, I think that just the fact that these are truly unlimited payment rails that facilitates some of the largest commerce events that we've ever had in the Internet's history. It's going to be perpetually underrated as something that blockchains can enable. I mean, so many things in crypto are they go through this phase where these ideas come onto the scene and they strike a chord and there's an initial flurry of interest and excitement, but the early movers are imperfect in some way. And then you get some sort of a collapse. And then the entire notion is written off for dead. That's this pattern that's played out every single time we've had a crypto cycle. I think NFTs are probably like the prime example of what people are going to be talking about in that vein this time around. Like, oh, these things are dead. I can't believe we like spent all of that time talking about monkey pictures, what a waste. And then every time inevitably what happens is that the idea gets hardened, maybe there's a technology enabler, or maybe in most cases it's just kind of putting pieces together just properly where it works and it works in like a staggeringly big way. And it catches so many people by surprise, so that pattern's going to play out. It'll happen with NFTs.NFT is just so obviously here to stay, they're so obviously this game changing building block for everything from providing seed capital to seed community, to ideas, that it's going to work. And I actually think if you looked at all of the tokens market cap collectively as a percentage, and you looked at ERC 20s or fungible tokens versus non-fungible tokens, I actually think the non-fungible token dominance against fungible tokens is going to increase over time, just because I think it's a better form factor for so much of the use cases, so many of the use cases that we wanted to use tokens with. That's one, I think anytime your instinct is to write something off for dead because it had a bust or this specific version of it didn't pan out in as durable ways you wanted, almost count on it coming back in a strengthened form the next go around.",3767
44,Alok Vasudev - Searching for White Space,Examples of Productive Speculation," Patrick: Can you say a little bit about this notion of productive speculation that we chatted about before? I think Bill Janeway was the person that popularized this idea. It's a really interesting idea. Carlota Perez has done some work here too. Everyone agrees there's been speculation. Why has some of it been productive in your mind? And what does that concept mean? Alok: Janeway, he's amazing. Patrick: He's incredibly bright. Alok: He talks about the role of the state in innovation in his books where ultimately he views it as a critical part of this innovation supply chain and they provide a form of kind of capital and direction that really is the straw that stirs the drink downstream for kind of innovation that we get. One interesting observation about crypto is, and I'd love to see you're a student of tech history as well, I think it's the only platform shift or only kind of tectonic tech wave that's emerged that didn't originate with a monolithic buyer. In the sense that semiconductors kind of the computing industry, the government was the monolithic buyer. They were commissioning chips for missiles. They were building data centers for intelligence. And then you look at things like application software as computing matured and it was the enterprise that was the monolithic buyer.In fact, like Janeway talks about this a lot but the idea that you would kind of presale multi-year licenses to buy applications kind of before the SaaS model was there. Part of why that worked is because they would pay upfront to subsidize the R&D costs of the innovator in order to ultimately deliver what they promised over the horizon of that contract. So you have government, you have enterprises and both these were kind of these monolithic buyers that basically through contracts subsidized the R&D work that led the maturation of these technologies. But crypto never had a monolithic buyer, it actually just had retail. It had people that were kind of putting in money into these things. So I always wondered if that was kind of a part of the volatility. That was a part of kind of why cryptos evolved in this path of a way is the fact it's kind of the only tech revolution that didn't originate in that manner. Patrick: Yeah, it makes me wonder what the answer is. Media came to mind at first, but the advertisers are kind of monolithic in their own way, especially early on in media. I guess, today, they're on the Facebook ad platform, or something, but certainly early media was monolithic ad buyers. Matt Ball writes about this in his metaverse book. The entire metaverse concept is perhaps like you're describing with crypto, one of the first major technology platforms that we don't really know what that looks like yet that doesn't have a monolithic buyer. It is more consumer driven, retail driven as you put it, but web three, and metaverse are probably in some ways linked together. So, maybe I'm saying the same thing. It's a really interesting observation. Like the lack of a monolithic demand pool is kind of wild when you really think about it. I'm curious, when you say productive, especially, what the best in your mind historical example of this is in crypto specifically. So there was some area of rampant speculation. We went through the cycle, speculators got wiped out, but something really important, and productive was established. What's your favorite example of that in action? Alok: Janeway's definition of productive speculation is where the euphoria in a bubble allows or facilitates the funding of RNB. That otherwise would not have been funded that ultimately leads to what he calls general purpose technology. Something that can be broadly applicable that creates value across the economy. That's kind of the general frame, so it's basically like what are the types of things that get funded in bull markets that actually play out often years down the line, or cycles down the line. Productive is where you say that I'm going to take advantage of the fact that the money's flowing and I'm going to build something real that may take more time, or that may be much harder that I may not have been able to capitalize in a moment where we didn't have this excitement. And then when it plays out, it's going to move us forward materially.And so examples of that are Ethereum, as an example, in 2014, it was a story of Bitcoin and the altcoins. And then the idea of having a smart contract enabled blockchain, that was a wild concept a lot of people thought it was infeasible, unworkable. Ethereum raised money in kind of the hype of, still, it was kind of caught up one of those Bitcoin bubbles. It took a couple years for it to be built, but then that's an example of something that really pushed us forward as an industry in terms of really making this tangible general purpose blockchain computer. Another example in kind of 2018, I think that zero knowledge cryptography as a theme was still in the lab at the time. And there were companies like Startware, and disclosure, we work with them. That's an example of a company where zero knowledge cryptography was kind of on that cusp of going from science to engineering.And there wasn't an obvious near term market for it. And so it really, I think, took the exuberance of a bubble in order to adequately capitalize a company like that to undertake years of really hard and pioneering RNB work. And here we are one cycle later where there are some of the most popular applications in crypto live on these stark chains, and they use zero knowledge proofs under the hood for improved performance. I think zero knowledge cryptography is going to be one of these general purpose technologies that we're going to see take all sorts of forms. And it's going to blow people's minds as it proliferates. Patrick: Bitcoin encryption, I could explain to somebody. I could not explain zero knowledge in any way, shape or form. Can you explain that? Alok: The simplest way to understand it, there's a bunch of really rigorous math, and cryptography behind it, but the essence of it is that I can prove something to you. I can prove a fact to you without revealing the specifics. If I'm doing some sort of zero knowledge proof of the amount of money I have in my bank account, I can construct a proof that I can hand to you, and you can kind of quickly easily verify this proof says I have more than $100 in this account, but you don't need to know where that is. You don't need to respect it. You don't need to know anything about it other than this proof is sacrosanct. It's done. Patrick: I don't need to show you the bank account screenshot. I can just... This is like an abstracted thing that proves something. Alok: Yep, exactly. The first application for these things that people are using them for is in blockchain scalability where blockchain itself, it's a computer and the computer is updating its state. Every time a program executes, it's going to execute its state. These are state transitions that a blockchain computer goes through. The job of the blockchain is to ensure that these state transitions it goes through are valid, through the rules of the computer. That means nobody's double spending money. That means... Patrick: This is the consensus mechanism usually. Yeah. Alok: Exactly. Zero knowledge roll up is a term, or if you use this a zero knowledge proof as a form of blockchain scalability, you can have a really fast blockchain that can prove that it operated correctly. And rather than needing to have every single node validate every single step themselves, which is how some blockchains operate today, this proof can suffice for the validity of what the computer did instead of like everybody replaying every single operation that a blockchain went through, they're just checking the proofs. Patrick: It sounds like that is like another bandwidth. It's just another speed upgrade that's been a Bitcoin takes 10 minutes every time to it's very slow moving computer, community operated computer. This is like something that unlocks fast community operator computers. Is that like an overgeneralization or is that roughly right? Alok: Yeah. It's another way to improve the speed of it. And that's the first, I would say, most obvious use of zero knowledge proofs, but I think it's going to get wild. I think it's going to get beyond that. Like for example. So let's say that you wanted to start in a non Twitter account. What are your problems, and how do you bootstrap that audience? What if you could construct a proof that said, ""I can't tell you who I am, but I'm somebody who had this many followers on my real account"", like zero knowledge, proof of audience as an example, right? These are the kinds of concepts that can be opened up by this stuff. And I think it's going to have broader implications beyond just blockchain, scalability. Patrick: It's an interesting portability concept. You can move credentialing, or signals, or value, or something across different networks. It's kind of cool. Kind of cool sounding. Alok: Exactly. Zero knowledge proof of being an accredited investor. Patrick: How does it get built, starts to bridge the question of how you can connect things that aren't native to the digital or even blockchain native stuff in the physical world, or some independent truth or things outside of the blockchains themselves that can somehow get linked onto blockchains. People talk about putting their house on a blockchain or something like this. How does that work? Like in the accredited investor example, now you're talking about, you're having to go off of a pure crypto native environment into antiquated old. A thing to prove that you're an accredited investor is the old here's how much money I have in my bank or here's my W2 or whatever the methods are. So how do you link something that's old and offline in a sense to something that is fast, and new and programmable, and online? Alok: This is where I think that zero knowledge cryptography can be one of these bridge solutions. At a high level, it's really about how do you extend trust guarantees around computing operations? Computational integrity is a term that a lot of people in zero knowledge talk about. How do you know that a computer is doing what you said it's doing? Proofs are one way that you can enforce a degree of integrity, or accountability on a computing service. For example, and again, we're getting into like wildly speculated territory here. I think this technology's still pretty nascent, and there's a lot to come. I would say, just undergone this transition from the stuff that's the domain of the research lab to stuff that now can be tinkered with in production, but you could imagine part of the problem is so off chain on chain has been really hard. And I would say that I kind of bias towards being an on chain maximalist in the sense that I think off chain on chain is something that always feels like just within arm's reach, but it always almost is perpetually like that.And the fundamental problem for this is that you have competing systems of record. Competing ledgers. Blockchain is one ledger, and then you have the courts or the legal system for something else, that's a competing ledger. And ultimately like you want these two to keep in sync all the time, but there are situations where they can get out of sync, and then which authority reign supreme in most situations, it'll be the legal version of it. So then if the legal version is ultimately supreme to the blockchain version, what's the point of the blockchain version? That's kind of the argument for why putting your house on the blockchain makes no sense. You have a token that represents your house, and then somebody hacks it and they'd steal your token, or do you just walk out of your house? Like, I guess I lost it then. Off chain on chain, really hard.And I think that for the most part, I'm not a big believer in people pushing the boundary and off chain to off chain. But with zero knowledge, you can at least say that, ""Hey, I can guarantee that this particular compute task was done correctly."" For example, anybody could do it right? It could still be permissionless. Let's say for this toy example, we're talking about that zero knowledge proof of audience thing. You could have a number of companies, or a number of entities who could run this task of you opting with Twitter. And then they kind of verify that you own that account. And they run some like compute task that verifies your proof of audience. If you have that proof, then you know the computation was done correctly. You've kind of now provided a guarantee for something that's been done in a way where other people can do it. You're not reliant on a single person to do it for you, but you still have a form of that guarantee. It's abstract.",2881
45,Alok Vasudev - Searching for White Space,Applications of NFTs and Crypto in Gaming and Art," Patrick: No, I get it. I think this is the stuff that it's kind of like back to your original thing of white space. How many VCs could explain this? Far fewer that can... There's a lot of VCs in crypto now, right? Like it fills that test, but whereas like no one able to think or talk intelligently, it's interesting to explore these theoretical frontiers, you bring it back down to earth a little bit, and something that I've thought a lot about is gaming. Especially my conversation with Gabe, which has been one of the most popular that we've done in the show, and also one of my favorites. This notion of there being, that his advantage in the old play to earn video game world was that he had a live op team. And so he could sort of like pay to secure the value of the stuff in his games. And he could monetize there's a limit to that monetization at $100 a user, a transaction or whatever. Maybe one of the things crypto does is just unlock stuff in gaming, settings that were previously set by other platforms that you couldn't get around the $100 upper limit or something. How do you think this technology intersects with the world of gaming where we know there's tons of demand. We don't have to debate that. It's like obvious. We know people like to spend a lot of money on games. Like all these things are true. What does crypto do to the gaming world over the next 10 years, do you think? Alok: I would say like gaming applications of blockchains or blockchain assets, that's been conceived of pretty much since the beginning of the space. And I think people have pointed to things like in-game economies have become really important value drivers for modern games. Everyone talks about skins. Everyone talks about these types of things. And so like, it's been clear that, ""Hey, like these two things they're probably going to fit together at some point"", some of the crypto people, I think to some degree are a little bit more like optimistically forward, looking around it, right? The idea that you can take... I'm going to take my sword in this game because it's an open and interoperable sword. I'm going to go like play with it in other games. And there's going to be this shared economy between games and all that. Maybe. But I think that I'm pretty skeptical, at least in the near term of those type of ideas working.But what I love about Gabe is that I think he's done a great job of correctly assessing what it is that crypto can give you that can blow minds in terms of what the experience of being a part of game is. But that's also rooted in what makes a good game, and what might people actually want to do. And does it actually jive with the incentives and motivations for all involved? I mean, unrestricted payments, I think people don't appreciate how big of a deal this is for games. The app store has the $100 limit on how much you could pay into it at any given time. And it takes a 30% haircut on anything that goes through. And so when you contrast that to like a middle of the curve NFT project routinely has asset sales in the tens of thousands of dollars, hundreds of thousands, dollars and millions in kind of the top end case, you just compare and contrast those two. And you're like, ""Wow, there's such a big opportunity just to explore the upper end of monetization for games.""The idea that instead of driving millions of people to press the $100 button, a bunch of times, if you can get a much smaller fraction to press the million dollar button once, you can actually get an equivalent outcome in terms of value to the company, that's where I love the way that he thinks about it. And to me, it makes all the sense in the world because we have these singular moments of commerce that we've had on the internet, right? I think the blockchains probably set all the records for them. Patrick: If you think about the potential where a lot of the utility happens, but there's not like an investment return. My mind goes to this conversation I had with Alex Danko from Shopify and this notion of token gated commerce that Shopify is playing with where merchants can use NFTs in this case, or non-fungible tokens to privilege certain customers. And that could have some value, but maybe the NFTs themselves aren't that valuable. They're just something that you get that unlocks some benefit that itself is valuable. How do you think about that potential where, yeah, there's going to be an amazing amount of tech utility that comes because of this technology, but that doesn't necessarily mean you should buy Ethe, or the value may not accrue to Ethe, or Bitcoin or somewhere else. Do you think that's possible? How do you handicap that future? Because we've talked mostly about use cases, not so much about like investing perspective, investment returns of you're running an investment firm. So obviously I think there's investment returns to be earned, and historically there has been. How do you think about that potential of, huh, maybe this is DCPPIP, and it's unbelievably impactful, but no one makes any money from it. Alok: I think it's extraordinarily unlikely that kind of NFTs work. And then somehow the blockchains are built on top of, and the monetary assets that secure these blockchains don't also benefit from that value creation. Extraordinary, unlikely. I think there some deep structural reasons where kind of really can't have one without the other. For example, if you think about Ethe as a monetary asset or the qualities of its moneyness, one of the big benefits Ethe has as a form of money is its use as a unit of account within this growing blockchain GDP that we have, right? So NFTs are priced in Ethe. The trading pairs for on chain liquidity is Ethe denominated. So, that's a really important function of money. And Ethe has really done a terrific job with penetration on those dimensions.And then the even deeper structural reason is that NFTs live on blockchains, and the economic security underpinning a blockchain is what gives you the guarantees it can operate. And that economic security is just related to the reserve token and whether it's an adequate incentive for people to maintain consensus. And so the higher the market cap of the token, the more valuable Ether is the harder it is for somebody to go and compromise the computer. The more valuable the block space in Ethereum is, the more valuable that is then the asset, Ether, should improve and value commensurate to that. Patrick: Yeah, I think that makes a lot of sense that these things won't be secured unless someone's incentivized to do it and that's money. I mean, at the end of the day. The NFT thing is so interesting and the world of art, I don't just mean like NFT art, but like music, or any form of art where there's big fan bases has become in this cycle integrated into this world. Like you see lots of famous celebrities with a board ape, or you have examples of musicians that are adopting this technology to sell NFTs and make a lot more money than they might have in traditional means even doing concerts or something. Tell me what you think about what's going on in the world of art, and IP around art in all its forms and how that could intersect with this technology. Alok: I mean, you're spot on. Like what I said earlier is I think that NFTs are a great way to seed capital and seed community is what you can get with NFTs. It's one of these things where I think that a lot of the celebrity NFT drops are probably in the unproductive speculation category that we talked about earlier, but there are a number of these things, this concept of, hey, I want to pursue a creative endeavor of some sort. And I'm looking for seed capital and a seed fan base around me. An NFT is a great fit for that. As an artist, you've got a chance to... You get to capital, you've got kind of an embedded fan base, and you've got a community that you can use that can grow over time.And as a member, you get all the special feelings of kind of being in on something early, everything from like it being a form of your identity. And to even this idea that maybe there's even upside in it, right? Maybe I can even follow along the journey for something that I'm a part of and even get rewarded somehow some way for it. One of my favorite stories about the role of internet community in actually creating, and succeeding with aiding a creative endeavor at the highest levels is The Martian, have you seen, like obviously Matt Damon blockbuster movie, but... Patrick: I remember reading the book. Alok: Yeah. Well, do you know the origin story for the book? Patrick: I knew it at some point, but remind me, I forget. Alok: Andy Weir had a day job as a programmer, I believe. And he was just blogging chapters of The Martian and he would post a chapter on his blog. And then like a couple months later, he'd post the next one, people on the internet found it. And he got basically this fan base that was building up this community that was forming around it. They would do things like fact check the science for him. They would add value to the story. And, of course, they were in on it. They were ... Can't wait for the next chapter to drop. I imagine that community, and the fact that he had a fanbase that he can point to, probably played some role in him securing the book deal. And, of course, the book was a best seller and that validated the concept to get the movie green-lit. And so this idea that actually an internet community was there on the ground floor, in this creative endeavor that ultimately went the distance, I think it's just such a cool story. That's one of the examples I point to as to where yeah, we could do more of that. And that feels like a thing that we're going to get more of in the future, not less of.",2255
46,Alok Vasudev - Searching for White Space,Smoothing Away the Crypto and Other Controversial Opinions," Patrick: There's this notion, that you've mentioned before, which is around the importance of obscuring complexity to get this thing to the next level. The idea of a ZK-rollup. Like the next Andy Weir is not going to have any frigging idea what that means, but he probably would quickly understand the general notion of what that example might mean and to do in practice. So are those companies being built? Are the companies being built that would be the platform that's simple to use and easy to understand, and I don't give a crap what's going on under the hood but it's facilitating this kind of interaction with my fanbase, or something? Is that stuff happening? When do you think that will become the norm, that emerging artists of various kinds will think about their art and their fanbase in this way? Alok: I believe it's somewhat of a controversial opinion on this, which is that here's this idea that we need to kind of smooth away the crypto, abstract away this stuff, make it really polished, make it really frictionless, make it look like products and services that you're used to using. Only then will we have mass appeal. It's going to cope for not having good enough draws for the mass market into crypto yet. I think what we found is, for example, early in NFTs there was these ideas that ... I'm talking kind of pre-2021 and even early 2020, this idea where how do we get more mainstream digital artists? How do we get people that are outside of the crypto orbit to start to use this stuff and think about it?You'd go through these painstaking steps to, ""Well we'll let you get paid in dollars. You're never going to have to touch a cryptocurrency. You'll never have to have a wallet. We will make it seamless. It will be like using Substack or something like that."" And it worked, right? I think there were people that were like, ""Yeah, you've adequately removed friction for me and so now I guess I can try this thing."" And then what happened is NFTs went bananas. They struck a chord and the appetite for NFTs went haywire. Then it was the total opposite and you had people saying like, ""Well, excuse me, where do I connect my MetaMask here? And why are you not giving me eth?"" And it's one of these situations where you're like, ""Oh, it turns out that NFTs weren't just ready. Once they're ready people will meet us where we are because they want it and we've struck a chord, in terms of what they actually want to do.""That's why I think even especially for thinking about this idea of NFTs as a substrate for early financing and coordination around creative endeavors it's Jeffrey Moore 101 stuff. It's really understanding who are the early adopters? And understanding that new concepts have this diffusion, like a law of physics that they follow. You can't skip steps in that progression. And so it's not about just, ""Am I going to appeal to a mainstream writer today that's going to turn down a book deal in order to do this weird NFT community thing?"" That's probably not the right fit. The right fit is somebody that's just the right ... They are a creative genius and they can succeed at the highest levels but they need this medium in order to actually achieve that potential. So they probably know something about crypto, they probably have a stronger point of view on the right way to use these tools to accomplish their goals. They're kind of the definitional early adopter for something new. They live in the same future as the creator of the tools or the platform. Patrick: Yeah, I love that concept. I think it's really cool. Maybe we shouldn't zoom all the way to the end. You have to build your way there. What other controversial opinions do you think you hold, in the crypto community specifically? Like are there things that if I got 10 other super smart people onto our Zoom they'd think you're nuts about but you believe strongly? Alok: Unchained maximalism, like I described earlier. And this actually stems to kind of the NFT-IP question, which is interesting. There's this idea that can we have things like IP rights attached to NFTs? Maybe like the use of IP ... Or the downstream monetization of IP can we have a way for that to flow back in some for to the holder of an NFT? I tend to be more skeptical about these ideas. Again, just because I think that reconciling stuff in the legal system with stuff in the blockchain is just really hard. I don't know, this may be contentious but I'm really intrigued by this CC0 movement in NFTs. Patrick: What's that? No, I haven't. Alok: It's a really interesting idea and it's still in the space where I have no idea if it's going to work or not. I want it to work because I think it'll create a very interesting future, if it does work. With NFTs there's IP behind these NFT projects. And we can think about a basic art PFP 10,000 picture NFT drop, as the example here. There are some situations where the IP is owned entirely by the company that issues the NFTs. The company can do a deal with that IP and they can make money on it but there's not necessarily a right to any of that that you have as a holder of the NFT. Then there's another situation where the holder of the NFT actually gets the IP license for their NFT. If there's a deal done where this NFT is used in an ad or something like that and your NFT was used, or something like that, then you would be entitled to that or you could sue them for claim on cash if you didn't get anything from it.The core idea here is that there is some IP, these NFTs have licenses that are protected, and then we're kind of debating who controls it, who has the rights to income from it and who decides how it's used. And, ultimately, that requires reconciling the blockchain with some sort of off-chain legal system. The same applies for music if you're promised royalties, et cetera.And then there's this idea, CC0, which is Creative Commons license, which is the same ... Like Shakespeare is under this license, right? Basically free to use, do whatever you want with it. There's this movement within the NFT space where what if you just didn't put a license on the NFT at all? What if it was just literally do whatever you want with it? Could it work? If you owned an NFT and let's say you had no structural claim on the IP with it, but if maybe that meant that the NFT project could actually get distributed further it could actually have more cultural relevance because you removed barriers for it spreading far and wide, could that actually have an indirect feedback loop where you still ... Your asset still becomes more valuable? Patrick: Yeah, it's like what if Apple's takeover Zero kind of idea? Alok: Yeah. There's the project Nouns DAO that I think a bunch of Ethereum people, myself included, love and we think of this as one of these really interesting concepts in the NFT world that a lot of people are paying attention to. I would say it's probably one of the most notable CC0 project. And we've seen the Nouns' glasses has become this iconic image from this project and we saw it in a Super Bowl commercial. I think Budweiser, one of the beer companies, had the Nouns' glasses in the Super Bowl commercial. They didn't pay royalty because all of that Nouns' IP is CC0. It's this really interesting question of kind of indirect value accrual. And there's a really cool frame on it where right now, with IP, distribution and monetization happens along the same access. I get views on YouTube and I get paid for those views on YouTube. I get listens on Spotify and I get paid for those listens on Spotify. And there's this inherent tension between getting it distributed far and wide but also being able to bear hug it, so you can make sure to get what's yours.If CC0 and NFTs are in a deal, what if there's now like another access to this? What if you can monetize in a way where you don't have to even think about constraining distribution? I don't know if it's going to work. It's one of these things where it's like ... But the world to me where you can actually think about IP just as free flowing and you can remix it, and you can do whatever you want, it's a pretty interesting kind of form of abundance that I don't think we've seen yet with IP. And if NFTs could be the solve for where value can still be created I think at least it's a very interesting version of the future. But I totally understand how it's going to fall on its face as well, because it's really nice to be able to directly make money from IP.",1996
47,Alok Vasudev - Searching for White Space,What Alok is Most Bullish and Bearish on," Patrick: We're recording this in the summer, mid-summer of 2022. From this vantage point, in the crypto ecosystem, what are you most bearish on and most bullish on right now? Alok: I'm incredibly bullish on Ethereum as an ecosystem. Everything ... Every advantage its had has, in my mind, been strengthened. I think there are a few upgrades and changes in the pipeline that are going to further improve it. I think it's always been the ecosystem that is at the top of the innovation supply chain in the space. In the sense that all the newest and zaniest, and best, ideas tend to take place within the Ethereum community first. The ecosystem's done a great job, over time, of just systematically addressing the biggest issues with it. In 2017 it was, ""This thing won't scale and your roadmap for how to do it is ridiculous. Imagine a world in where within the community people just build things that have higher performance that attach to it. This idea that you don't have a centrally coordinated company developing and hiring engineers against a roadmap that's never going to work. This idea that you can just plant a flag for how you think it should work and then let the community almost build the bridge along the way."" But that's exactly what happened.We have rollups that are functioning, we have sidechains that are functioning. Every single thing that people thought couldn't happen but Ethereum kind of ... The community at large chose is kind of working out. I still think it's just underappreciated as one of the most monumental tech projects we've ever had.What am I most bearish on? In this moment I'm very bearish on things that really need count on retail speculation as a driving force for it functioning or gaining adoption. In general it's not great when you're counting on that as a chief component but I think especially so when we're not going to have any for some time, if you're not viable in a fundamental way then it's not going to work. I actually think people deeply appreciate how much retail speculation was the driver for a lot of what we saw, even things that were dressed up as not speculation driven. Like the yields that people talked about in DeFi. Where'd the yields come from or the eye-popping yields. I think that if you actually decompose those yields and where do they actually come from, where is $1.00 being turned into $1.10, a large part of those yields somewhere, however many steps behind the scenes, there was some token that was ultimately being bid up by retail speculators that was being market sold, that generated the yield. So when that goes away the yield collapsed, everything goes away.I think there are genuine structural sources of yield within crypto that are real and sustainable, and they're probably rightly so not going to provide eye-popping numbers. But, for example, like staking for blockchain security super structural and it's like a net new form of yield that we've never seen before because blockchains are new. If you're counting on some bottoms-up movement or speculation to really drive what you're doing it's not going to work. I think a large part of ... I would say like the second half of what we saw in DeFi a lot of those ideas had that base assumption in them. I'm pretty bearish on off-chain to on-chain stuff. Even some things like reconciling IP off-chain but kind of keeping the on-chain piece working. That, to me, feels really hard. There may be narrow situations where it could work but I think as a category it's not going to work.If we do this again in years I'll be perpetually bearish on enterprise blockchains. That's the easiest punching bag out there. The idea that these things are just like a database and token doesn't matter. One day I hope we'll fully disabuse ourselves of that notion.I actually feel like I'm an optimist by default, so all this stuff is going to work. NFTs are going to work. Crypto gaming's going to work. Blockchains are going to scale. Most of the Web3 concepts that we're talking about are going to work. It's just a question of the sequencing and what do we need as structural enablers from a tech standpoint, and from a behavior change standpoint? And then how much learning from trial and error do we need as an ecosystem, as an industry in order to actually just get it just right where it can actually go the distance? Patrick: Well, Alok, this has been so much fun. I mean, there's so many concepts here that ... I'm always drawn back to this because I'm a funny case where I've spent so much time talking to the smartest people in this world, never really put a whole lot of money into it. You know much to my chagrin looking back, even though it's been ugly recently. I've loved our conversation because I think there's a lot of cool new ideas, whether it's the bandwidth of money, the Creative Commons concept, the four-by-four quadrant around what makes for an effective stable coin. Lots of great interesting ideas. I think you know I ask everyone the same traditional closing question. What is the kindest thing that anyone's ever done for you? Alok: When I was in high school I was working at a sandwich shop and one of our neighbors, who is one of the most distinguished chemists of all time and he's a prolific researcher but he was my next store neighbor, and he saw me in this sandwich shop. And he was like, ""What are you doing in a sandwich shop?"" I was like, ""I don't know, making money."" 15, what do you want? And he said, ""Do you want to work in my lab?"" Basically I got the chance, as a high schooler, to work in his lab. I had basically taken one chemistry class at that point.I had gone through some personal stuff. My dad died about a year before that and so I think part of it was just like him just helping me on a very human level, but what it did was it really set me on a path where science became something that I really fell in love with. And it became so fundamental to who I was and a part of my identity. It set me on a really terrific trajectory, academically and professionally. I had published papers in high school, which sets you up for research in undergrad, which sets you up for research in grad, all these things. And so it was awesome. And I don't think I'd have accomplished anywhere near what I have if it weren't for Grant Wilson. Patrick: Do you remember the first thing you worked on in the lab for him? Alok: I do. My job was to produce these things called myerhotherplots. It's semiconductor chemistry. And the idea is you have these things called photoresists, which are chemicals that you put on top of a wafer and you selectively expose the photoresist to light. And then you can dissolve the parts that haven't been exposed to light, so it forms like a mask on top of it. So you put a mask on and then you can either etch away the parts that are exposed or you can grow another layer. And that's how these integrated circuits are built, layer by layer, where you're basically masking each time to connect all the wires. We were working on photoresists and the way we're ... Again, this is hilarious that we're getting into this. But if you want to make the resolution of these masks higher, you want to have smaller features, one way to do it is you want to have smaller wavelengths of light that actually do this photochemistry within them. The smaller the wavelength of light the smaller the feature you can define in the mask, the smaller and higher performing semiconductor chip you can write with it.So we were working on cutting edge photoresist chemistry for a lower wavelength of light that hadn't really been pioneered yet. And the goal was we were trying different things to figure out what worked. And I was the guy that would basically test how well it worked. And so it meant me just having this big truckload of samples and putting them on wafers, and shining light, and measuring things. It was a very mechanical form the way it worked but it was very much the grunt work in the lab. But I loved every minute of it. Patrick: What a wonderful story. I wish there was some way to manufacture a similar experience to that for every 15 year old. I would have benefited so much from something like that at that age. What a cool, amazing kindness. I love it. Alok, this was a blast. Thank you so much. Great closing story. Great set of ideas. I really appreciate your time.

48,Matthew Ball - A Manual to The Metaverse,Introduction," Patrick: My guest today is Matthew Ball. Matt is an investor, the former head of strategy at Amazon Studios, and one of the brightest minds in the media industry. Through his essays and now his book which launches today, Matt has established himself as the foremost authority on the metaverse, which has stormed into the public eye since I first had him on the show two years ago. The metaverse is the focus for our discussion, and I hope you enjoy this encyclopedic tour through all of its details as much as I did.",120
49,Matthew Ball - A Manual to The Metaverse,Familiar Platforms with Metaverse Elements," Patrick: Well, round two is here. We get to talk about one of the most interesting topics in the world, especially because of how much insane detail there is under the topic of the metaverse, much of it contained in your awesome new book that I just finished a couple days ago. I think a fun place to begin picking up on our last conversation is with a couple analogy questions, specifically around things that already exist that people will be familiar with, and the degree to which you think they represent something like the metaverse. I want to start here as an anchor point, rather than go deep into the infrastructure right from the beginning. So I'd love you to stack rank these four big ideas, and you tell me which you think from most to least represents metaverse elements. Those four being Minecraft, Ready Player One, Fortnite, and Facebook's Horizon. Matthew: So let me swerve quickly. I would say that the closest representation that we have comes from one platform that you didn't list, and then another perspective on one that you did. Roblox for all of its focus on children, they have 55 million daily active users. About 45% of them are under 13, 85% of them are under 25 lacks many of the things that we expect from the metaverse certainly enterprise applications. Certainly a degree of criticality in the modern economy at large. But we're talking about a platform that has hundreds of millions of monthly users, billions of hours of engagement, in excess of 75 million different virtual worlds. Each of which is tightly integrated with one another. Consistent communications, hierarchy in access. The same avatar and identity system, same currency, import/export of objects, a single path of discovery. We're talking about a parallel plane of existence that is simultaneously enormous and highly diverse, but also cohesive. The second closest would be to take a look at the Epic Games ecosystem. We can really take a look at two different aspects of that on the consumer facing side. One is Fortnite, which is for the most part a battle royale. But they also have Fortnite Creative Mode, which is their Roblox platform.What's fascinating about that latter platform, which by the way, they say is nearly half of all engagement time today, is that later this year, they're planning to bring Unreal based editing. So this is going to fundamentally overhaul how you can tool, author, modify. You have the consumer-facing low or no code platform that children could use, but then you can tap into the million plus expert developers who can supplement that with their professional capabilities. On top of that, you have the broader Unreal ecosystem. And this is where we start to talk about interoperability at large, the application of consistent backends, common file formats, consistent communication suites that spans 75% of next generation games, numerous different automotive platforms, an increasingly large footprint in architecture engineering construction, or the ACE field. To focus on Fortnite, to focus even on Fortnite Creative Mode is too small. What makes this opportunity and this ecosystem so much larger than Roblox is that it's already deployed widely in many different use cases. The connective tissue isn't yet in place. But when we're talking about the closest template to the metaverse in the future, that ecosystem looks primed. Patrick: You didn't say Facebook horizons. By the time it made its announcement, its name change, it was one of the largest companies in the world by market cap. Tons of free cash flow, tons of ability to invest. Tons of demonstrated will to invest. Huge amount of CapEx going into this with obviously one of the most interesting entrepreneurs in the world behind it. What do you make of their foray into trying to own this concept literally by changing their name to it? And why wasn't it in your top two? Matthew: First and foremost, one of the interesting evolutions in Mark's perspective has actually been publicly revealed on the record. Let's start a decade ago or so. There's a lot of focus on the metaverse as a term today, but it's clear that Mark has been running towards this for quite some time. Their second most expensive acquisition, actually third after WhatsApp and Instagram, was for Oculus nearly a decade ago. Another billion or $2 billion acquisition was that of control labs and electromyography interface and hardware company. It actually picks up electro skeletal muscle signals so that you can reproduce movements in virtual space. We know in 2015, he was looking to acquire Unity, the most widely deployed game engine globally. So this is something that he's clearly been interested in for quite some time. We also know from leaks in 2018 that there were internal memos saying that the metaverse was, ""Theirs to lose."" What has changed over the past four years is not just more investment, more aggression, a philosophical realignment of the business. But they are a lot more focused on the interoperable metaverse. And I actually think that that's sincere. We see this in their app store policies, they support side loading, third-party identities. They're the only major console platform to use third-party or open rendering APIs. OpenXR, WebXR, all of the consoles reject them. So we see a evolution of what they're trying to do and how they're trying to participate in the world that is different. But for all of that lineage, you're right to say that they are not top one or top two. Horizon Worlds is their effort to build a Roblox or Fortnite Creative Mode or Minecraft. What I call an integrated virtual world platform. It's not very popular today.Now they say that by the end of the year, they will launch a web browser based version, bringing instantaneous access to billions on the planet. Right now, the biggest impediment for any event in Roblox, or Minecraft, or Fortnite is that if you don't already have the 50 or 60 gigabyte installer on a device, you don't currently use it, there's a lot of friction. My mother's not going to instantly download it to participate in the Malcolm Gladwell event. But when it's browser based, when it's easy to use, when your entire social graph is there, there's some potential there. But this platform remains relatively modest. When you're talking about the billions that they are spending per animal, Horizon Worlds is a part of that. When you take a look at the full stack, they are of course investing billions in hardware design, AR and VR. We know that that's also moving into semis. We know that they're also investing in their own operating system. And then on top of that, we have the investments in content. Beat Saber, Population One, their battle royale, as well as into Horizon Worlds and many other pet projects around wearables and so forth. Horizon Worlds seems like one of the biggest opportunities. It has not historically been their focus, at least as relates to the metaverse. Patrick: Can you just define what you mean by the metaverse and what you think a good working definition is that allows us to test things to say, is this thing that everyone's excited about, or is it not? It seems obvious from our many conversations that the trend has been towards more digital engagement and participation. And that somehow, people think of the metaverse as the natural endpoint of this, where there's more sensory immersion in some virtual world, there's more navigability, there's less walled gardens. How do you define the metaverse in its simplest definition so that we can all work off the same idea? Matthew: A live 3D version of the internet as we know today is the best and simplest way to think about this. Why? Because it not only explains how it's a little bit different visually experientially. It keys into some of what you just mentioned, which is how it might be more intuitive. Of course, we didn't evolve for thousands of years to tap glass, to interact with 2D interfaces, static information. We explore, we immerse in 3D. It's a much better interface for many tasks. Far from all, but many tasks. But most importantly, we take for granted the interoperability of the internet and how important that is to everything we do and create. We don't think about this question of the New York Times can't link to Washington Post. We don't even think about the idea that you can't link directly to the specific piece of content on the Washington Post. We don't concern ourselves with, ""Darn. I took a photo on my iPhone that I stored to iCloud, and the file format therefore doesn't work on Facebook."" You can take a photo, upload it to Facebook, right click save as, put it onto Snapchat, screenshot it on Snapchat, upload it to TikTok. So we have this vast network that manages hierarchy, communications, reference, the transference of data across different autonomous systems coherently, safely, consistently. And then file formats and conventions that run university. We have a lot of 3D stuff today. There's a tremendous amount of time being spent in 3D platforms. What we don't have is a scalable network that actually interconnects. And as we've learned from the global economy, world trade, as we've learned with the internet at large, the utility that comes from that is extraordinary.",1992
50,Matthew Ball - A Manual to The Metaverse,The Role of 3D Engines," Patrick: Can you say a few words about the state of the engines behind three dimensional creativity or three dimensional output? You already mentioned Unity, and you already mentioned Unreal being the two dominant engines that people might be familiar with. But maybe paint a more vivid picture of the history here. And if 3D is literally in the definition of metaverse, it stands to reason that the engine that produces and allows people to produce beautiful 3D outputs is really, really important or central. Can you give us the details on the state of the world today as it relates to 3D engines? Matthew: Sure. I love this question. And let me actually start answering it by talking about the state of the world decades ago. I like to position the metaverse as a fourth era of computing and networking. The first was the mainframe era began in the 1950s for the most part, ran until the late 1970s. Let's keep in mind, mainframe still exists. It's actually a bigger business than ever. But it was largely superseded in the late 1970s, early 1980s by the advent of the personal computer, Apple, Microsoft, and TCPIP the internet. By the mid 2000s, we hit the mobile and cloud era. And now we're starting to talk about the next era in the metaverse. What's fascinating about the metaverse in contrast to the preceding three waves is where it seems to be starting. Seems to be starting as you've identified in gaming, consumer leisure. In a small segment in consumer leisure. People like to talk about gaming being larger than film. It's a bit of a misconception. You're talking about the theatrical box office. That's about 40 billion, but of course the video industry's over 600 billion, gaming's still around 200. When you take a look at those prior waves, mainframes started with mega enterprises. The internet began with government. Most of the early adopters were again, large corporations. Mobile began with enterprise and government as well. Each of these waves either never came to consumer leisure as was the case in mainframes or came there last. YouTube 2005, Netflix 2007, streaming wars 2019. Consumer leisure tends to be last.So why is it that the metaverse seems to be starting in the other direction? The answer relates to constraints. Constraints always define a technology from inception to its termination. The constraints for computing and networking in those prior waves was often processing power, broadband speeds, bandwidth, etc. And the result was you couldn't do much live. You couldn't share a photo with your grandmother. You couldn't stream video. But certainly, you could send a Blackberry message in the early mobile era. You could send an unstructured data file or CSV if you were a banker or accountant. So we needed substantial improvements in bandwidth and processing power for these new technologies to have consumer applicability. But the constraints that affected simulation, real-time rendered simulation, game engines was fidelity. It didn't have the bandwidth or the processing power to do a rich simulation. And what that meant is the government had very little use for it. You couldn't actually do a military simulation with fake fire. But it was fine for pong. It was fine for space invaders, Legend of Zelda. So we've spent decades with the primary area of development of game engines, of real-time rendering and GPU chips coming from consumer leisure. What has happened in the past few years is we have reached a point where the maturing and sophistication of these game engines coupled with the wide deployment of powerful processors means that that applicability has expanded. Automotive companies as I mentioned are using Unreal so that you can help drive your car. You can use LIDAR to scan the environment around you in your Range Rover, understand how to navigate, and then actually pre-drive your vehicle. You can live simulate a building.And what has happened is the companies that happen to have that expertise come from gaming. Nvidia's Jensen Huang. Of course, Nvidia's now the seventh largest company globally. Known to many investors for several years, but largely under the radar compared to most other top 10 companies was founded in the early 1990s, not long after Snow Crash was published. And Jensen has said they never wanted to be a video game company, but focusing on gaming was the best strategic choice they've ever made because it had three unique attributes. It was large, it was fast changing, and it was technologically intensive. Many industries like pharmaceuticals have two of those attributes, but they don't change that quickly. So the mixture of the intensity of these problems, the rapid improvements per Moore's law has meant that almost all these expertise sit here. Lastly, when you take a look at what this means for the metaverse today, Microsoft's Activision Blizzard acquisition, the largest big tech acquisition in history, 75 billion in enterprise value. Satya's press release, the final line of the very first paragraph says it provides the building blocks for the metaverse, the foundations for the metaverse. And a lot of that comes down to game engines. Patrick: If you think about the role of IP in the bootstrapping of the first metaverses, what comes to mind? I remember from our first conversation going really deep on Disney, and Marvel, and the incredible gravity and momentum that great IP universes allow for. And that very often, technology supports IP and not the other way around. That ultimately IP is the thing people show up for. They want to do something, they want to watch something, they want to be immersed in something. Activision Blizzard maybe is a good example here, but what is the role of existing or new IP as it relates to speeding up this change? Matthew: As with anything that we want to do, any place that we want to go, there's a reason why Disneyland is more fun than six flags is. If there's a place that we want to go, especially in a consumer leisure environment, it stands to reason that we want to go to the places filled with the stories and characters that we love. This has classically been Horizon World's fundamental problem. It's technically more robust than it is popular. It has better distribution than many other platforms. It doesn't have content, partly because it doesn't have as many developers, but in particular, the other platforms have been populated by produced in UGC IP for years now. If we're to go to a fantastical place, want that to be the place populated with the things we love. This isn't new. Of course, medieval gardens are adored with gargoyles and giant statues of lions because it provides immersion. We don't just want to walk down hedgerows. We want to feel like we're in the place we imagine. This is why many come to the inevitable conclusion that another medium full entertainment or another technological wave which has IP in it is naturally going to advantage those that have the most resident IP today. Disney does not have a gaming business. I think that remains a problem. Mostly because they don't have the capabilities for it. Whether or not they publish their own titles is a different question, but we're going to want to live in Disney IP. Patrick: I want to close out the concept of the power that these engines allow for, especially for those that haven't seen demonstrations of Unreal Engine 5. I encourage people to Google that and watch some it's shocking how realistic some of these renderings look. Looks like a perfect facsimile of the real world. Walk us through where that goes from here. It's hard to imagine Unreal Engine 5 getting much better, but you mentioned Moore's law. All of these things are riding improvement curves that are pretty nuts. If you compare Unreal engines, the first one through the fifth one, it's pretty wild. What does the seventh one mean or look like? Where's this all going? Matthew: A few things that are important. First, we can see a lot of the improvements on Unreal visually. But most of what's happening in the background is more important. So for example, I talked about the utility of gaming engines, or what you should think of 3D simulation engines, as evolving over time. One of the changes has been the investment, which is not widely deployed in deterministic physics. Most game engines don't do deterministic physics. They're non-deterministic, because a probabilistic outcome is sufficient. You and I see a grenade fly. It's not that important when it comes to scarce computational resources. We experience the exact same explosion visually and impact the environment. But as these engines look beyond leisure, it's increasingly important for them to solve it. When you think of game engines, it's actually not a very helpful term. It's really a software framework. It manages rendering and logic, but it's also the toolkit to create and design games. And it has an increasingly wide set of services and essentially checkbox functionality that supplements that. That can be AI or memory management, occlusion, which defines when you do and don't render objects. If you can't see it, it shouldn't be loaded so to speak. We're seeing it move into more services for live communications, real time translation. All of this comes to more than just physics, more than just fidelity. It is based on the belief that the most important thing to do for creators for the metaverse at large is to make it easier, cheaper, and faster to build better and more monetizable experiences. The real advances in other words for UE5, ease of use. And the number of additional things you no longer need. Light management, occlusion software, it's all baked in. Just like for Unity, their ad network, which is effectively part of their engine now, makes everything much, much easier. Patrick: If we think about the natural limits of the metaverse in our lifetime in the next 60, 70 years, what do you think the limits are? I just got back from a trip to the Smoky Mountains in Tennessee, and it's so hard to imagine some of the visceral joys of a beautiful place like that ever being purely digital, but maybe I'm wrong. What do you think the natural limits to the concept of the metaphors are? Matthew: I think there are many natural limits. We can see this with some of the present day constraints on computational power or networking. I love to use this point that comes from John Carmack. He was the founder of id Software, which made Doom. And then the CTO of Oculus, remains the consulting CTO of Oculus. He makes this point that if you asked him in 2000, and by the way, John believes that building the metaverse in a moral imperative. He says that tongue in cheek, but he does believe it. If you asked him in 2000, ""Could you build the metaverse with 100X the computing power that we have today?"" Today being 2000. He said he would've said yes. And yet it's been 22 years. We have roughly 100 to 120 times the computing power in the device that sits within inches of nearly every person on earth. And of course that means we have roughly 10 times as many of those devices. And he admits that we're still far from being able to build it without significant trade offs. We're actually testing the speed of light in many of the use cases that we would want to deploy. Comes down to the fundamental Sun Microsystems adage. The computer is the network. You can solve for computational needs on both sides, the client side or the server, but there's the speed of light to manage in between. The reason why I say this is a lot of the metaverse is achievable. But for many of those experiences, we need fundamental advances in battery life, in computation. Many metaverse researchers believe that we need quantum computing to pull most of this off.But when you're talking about what is it that we're going to replace, that is a more important question. We've all seen the funny Iceland video where they basically say, ""Don't go to the metaverse. Just hike Iceland."" I think it's funny. It's cute. There's a valid point in there. But at the end of the day, I don't believe that anyone is going to skip going to a baseball game, not go to a bar with their friend, not hike Iceland because of the metaverse. I think where that time is most likely to come from is the largest use of time today, which is TV. 300 million Americans watch five and a half hours per day of television. Not video. I'm not including TikTok or YouTube. When you take a look at the average American, they're awake for 14 and a half hours. I know that surprises probably almost all of your listeners. But when you're talking about five and a half hours per day, when you're awake for 14 and a half hours, much of that is work. The other use is necessity. It's essentially all that we do when we have free time. And I think that that's where metaverse time is likely to come from. Portions of that by the way, are skewed by the elderly. Those that are 55, 65 up. 65 up to seven and a half hours of video per day. They can't go to Iceland. None of us hope to retire to watch seven and a half hours of video per day. It's just we don't really have many alternatives. Those people are going to want to hike a virtual Iceland, certainly. And those people are going to be excited to be able to do so with their friends.",2875
51,Matthew Ball - A Manual to The Metaverse,Other Technology Behind the Metaverse," Patrick: What other sensory things do we need to think about here? We've talked a lot about the visual and the 3D rendering. What about audio? What about haptic touch? What about smell? Where do these things start to figure in maybe from most interesting to least in your mind? Matthew: At a baseline level, the more sensory inputs we have in there are important for immersion for usability, certainly. Multitouch was one of the most important innovations of the mobile era. And we should think about many of these other inputs as being similarly important. But there's also another element, which is just this cognitive brain registry issue. For example, a lot of people make fun of the fact that Horizon Worlds, your characters don't have legs. That's not really a stylistic preference. The challenge is of course, it's very hard to know what your legs are doing. Are you sitting or standing? Are you differently abled or not? These are questions that most devices can't currently tell you right away. Most VR software shows your hands and the first segment of your arms, but not the upper bicep/tricep error. And that's because it's easy to know where your wrist is and your hand is with external tracking cameras. But are your elbows tucked in or tucked out? Unclear. The reason why I say this is software can try to guess the answer. But when it guesses wrong, we have a lot of mental rejection. You think that you have control of this virtual simulacra of yourself, but it's not you. So many of these other devices are as much about improving what we can do in these spaces while also essentially doing a better job of mapping our brain. When you're talking about these devices, we see electromyography.I spoke about this earlier. This is just a device you wear on a limb, fairly lightweight, that uses electrical signals to reproduce your fingers in extraordinary detail in virtual space. Irrespective of whether or not there's a tracking camera in front of them, irrespective of whether or not the view is obscured. Really important for bringing more detail into these environments. We also talk about external tracking cameras. You might have something in your living room that's capturing you from another angle. One of the most fun things you can do in Beat Saber, that's a title on Oculus. It's essentially light sabers meet guitar hero, is you can actually use your iPhone, place it say 20 feet behind you. And then it scans you. And therefore, when you are wearing your Oculus headset, you're essentially John Malkovich-ing yourself. You see yourself in second person in a VR environment, watching yourself as you're immersed in that world. And that provides some thrill fun in Beat Saber, but it's essential to new capabilities of what we're going to do when, where, why, and how in 3D virtual space. Patrick: As I think about my own usage of Oculus, and I'm a person that wants all this stuff to happen. The idea of the Ready Player One haptic suit, and omnidirectional treadmill, and everything that goes into it, this full immersive experience just sounds fun. I was a video game junkie as a kid. Spent countless hours in some of these virtual worlds. I'm inclined to want to do it and be an early adopter of the technologies. I think I had one of the first Oculus. And when I put it on, what stands out as the Star Wars game, I'm forgetting the name of it. But really being blown away looking around like this is wild. And obviously, it's only going to get more and more perfectly rendered. I had the problem of getting a headache or a stomach ache when I moved artificially, which I want to hear about what you think about that. But at the same time as blown away as I was, I really haven't spent much time with Oculus on. And I'm curious if my experience as someone prone to want this to happen who tried it but really didn't last, is that indicative of the broader experience so far with Oculus? What do you think the reasons for something like that might be? Matthew: I want to hit a few different points here, because I think we're really talking about the suitability of alternatives that challenges with the current technology. And then the likely progression of said technology. Neal Stephenson, who of course coined the term metaverse. So he didn't originate the idea that spans nearly a century, has talked about the fact that yes, his conception of the metaverse was primarily an AR and VR experience. And he highlights the fact that that was a reasonable, if not the best hypothesis at the time, especially in the science fiction community. But he's highlighted that technology is path dependent. What we found out in the decade sense is that actually, hundreds of millions can adequately navigate 3D space with WASD on their keyboard. Forward, left, right, and back. Billions can navigate 3D space and choose to do so on a monthly basis using a touch screen. He says that he no longer considers that essential. It may be the best, most popular preferred way eventually. But it's not a requirement. And if you see Tim Sweeney at Epic shows very little interest, at least today in those new devices. The second part is talking about the experiences that you've mentioned. We have a good sense of what is likely to be required for min spec, for mainstream adoption of VR hardware. And I go into this a lot in my book. We tend to think for example that we need a refresh rate of 120 hertz on a VR headset. That's 120 frames per second. We probably need an 8K display. And I'm going to put aside other concerns for now like battery life, the weight of the device, the heat generated by the device, the number of additional sensors and tracking cameras we need, which constrain all available resources, but just 120 hertz and 8K display. Right now, the top of the line devices typically do 90 hertz and 4K.So we need a roughly 3X increase in the number of rendered pixels per second, just to hit min spec where people aren't suffering from nausea. You then layer in these devices have essentially late PS3, early PS4 graphics. Their computational load is much lower. Call of Duty: Warzone is limited to PC and gaming consoles only, but in exchange, the graphics are great. You can have 150 users. Fortnite plays on most devices, but as a result, you can only have 100 users. Free Fire from Garena is designed to work on all low end Androids. And as a result, it only has 50 players. Population one on the Oculus, their battle royale has only 18 players. So now we have a device that has half the resolution we want, two thirds of the frame rate that we want. It has PS3, PS4 graphics. And you can only have 18 other users. And then again, it probably has one eighth the sensors that we want, one third the battery life. It's probably 25% too heavy. There's a lot that we need to solve for these just to become min spec for nausea and usage. And then on top of that of course, we need these devices to be more than min spec. They need to feel better. The rejection of sensors, which is unique to VR. You can multitask on your PlayStation, you know whether or not your house is on fire. Your kids are upset. Your dog is getting into trouble. Probably raises that above min spec. We're getting there. We've roughly doubled resolution density. We've doubled processing power since 2017. So those who say we've been here before, people don't like VR don't appreciate the headway that we've made in these devices. But it's a lot like GPAs. It's easier to go from a 3 to a 3.4 than it is to go from a 3.6 to a 3.8. And we saw this recently as medic kicked out their releases for AR devices again, for the third time this decade. This is a hard tech problem. Patrick: If we step back and think about the base metal, the fiber, the actual physical stuff, technology behind the metaverse that's making it possible. What changes in technology or projects have you most excited or interested, understanding that the stuff serves as the plumbing. And most people will never actually see this stuff. But without it, there's no way the futuristic version of the metaverse comes to be. What has you excited in that? Matthew: So this is a fun one. I mentioned earlier Sun Microsystems. The computer is the network, and that's right. But basically what we need to solve for is more computing power. And that needs to be at one or both ends of a connection as in at the server or at the client side device. One of the things that's interesting about that is that there are differences of opinion as to how best to solve it. There is of course the cloud centric approach. This is what we see in cloud gaming, which says it's kind of insane that we have constraints in computational power in real time rendering. And we would say consumer devices replaced every two to three years in a small farm factor should have to do that work. Let's instead do the power plant model. Let's consolidate as much as possible, distribute it out to end points, and use industrial grade equipment that needs to be less worried about, size and form factor, heat generation, and so forth. The interesting thing about that model is it makes a lot of sense until it doesn't. So for example, you can precisely split electricity. You can't really do that with rendering. There's no efficient way thus far to split a GPU to support multiple instances of compute. Which is to say if you only need 80% of the power on one GPU, you can't really loan out the other 20%. In addition, we face the networking problem. Which is we don't struggle to get electricity from the local power plant to you when it's needed. And we certainly don't have constant effective brownouts that say Patrick, you can get 80% of what you need. And you can get the remaining 20% with 90% packet delivery success. And within two minutes of when you require it. We have all of these technical barriers.This leads to another perspective, and this is what's advocated by Tim Sweeney, though of course he focuses on client side rendering. Where he says efforts to improve performance on the wrong side of the latency wall are doomed to fail. Because while networks are improving, processing power is improving faster. And what he's saying is the network challenge is getting better. We're overcoming it. We're laying more fiber, more directly, with greater intelligence. We have more edge servers. But the thing in your pocket is getting better, faster. So his bet is actually more on Moore's law than it is on the network. The reason for that is connected to why. Many think that local devices are inefficient. We replace them all the time. We don't replace infrastructure that quickly. And when we do replace that infrastructure, it's typically highly inefficient. We don't lay cable as the crow flies. We have to manage for X and infrastructure, for parks, for global boundaries and more. So it actually turns out that it's very hard to make substantial improvements to network infrastructure, it's very expensive to do so, very slow to do so. And by the way, we have one other element. Which is as critical as improving networking speed is, we kind of have a lowest common denominator approach. And this is based upon network effects of all social services. Yes. Having more performance experiences is great. It advantages most use cases. But if Metcalfe's law means that services get better as more people use it, I.e. the underlying product isn't changed, but its utility to the user is because other users are using it. Then it makes more sense to build to the lowest acceptable network quality than it does to say let's cut off 30% of users so that we can have a better experience.Really. We need all networks to improve. Watching this trade off is fun. Matthew Prince at CloudFlare has actually rejected the idea that edge is the primary solution to real time rendering and processing. And he makes the point that edge is mostly important for data custody and regulatory compliance. That we're going to need to store more of our information, especially our personal information in the metaverse within national boundaries. It's not actually about co-opting the local device. It's about making sure that we're storing it in the right jurisdiction. The shorter or pithier answer to your question is we're watching all of these different pieces. How important is edge, how important is the local device, how important is cloud? And ultimately, it's a question of trade offs rather than which wins. But the ultimate hope, the fantasy is decentralized computing. Not necessarily in the blockchain sense, but the idea that we actually have abundant computing resources that are often dormant. Tesla talks about the idea that you should be able to lend out your unused Tesla in a world of automated vehicles. Well, I've got three consoles in my living room right now. None of them are in use. Is there a system where their power can be lent out to someone in my building when I'm not using them, thus obviating the network problem while intensifying their computational capacity at no cost to myself? There's some who believe that that's got to be the answer.",2870
52,Matthew Ball - A Manual to The Metaverse,The Importance of Interoperability," Patrick: This idea of everything talking to everything brings up one of the most interesting topics in all of this, which is the word interoperability. This word has gone from no one ever saying it to everyone saying it in five years. Both because of the metaverse and this next era of computing, but also because of blockchains, interoperability means a lot, is critical. No one really knows what the hell they're talking about it seems like when they bring it up. But it brings to mind things like standards and protocols. Again, the boring base layer stuff that makes the modern world possible. Whether it's visa, or TCP/IP, or SMTP it, some of these things you and I have talked about before. Can you talk about why interoperability gets its own chapter in your book, why this is such a key critical concept? And who might actually sponsor or start these things? Because many times in history, they're not for profit. It's a protocol. So walk us through this concept, because it seems like it's at the bottom of everything. Matthew: The fundamental premise of interoperability is a little bit foreign to the average person because we take for granted how interoperable online existence is today. You have a common identity at least in some way, shape, or form that you can take into multiple different avenues. Your content, the content that you create is inherently interoperable because the file formats are relatively standard and embraced everywhere. Ping runs everywhere. JPEG runs everywhere. Every unit of content we create today essentially runs everywhere else. Your text, your audio, your video, not just an image can be uploaded to every different environment. And in fact, the worldwide web itself works because of elements of TCP/IP, but also other consortiums and working groups of feathers that maintain a cohesive hierarchy or IP address, the domain registrar system. This is important not just for the continuity of the web, the cohesion of your personal experience, the persistence of things done online. But they're also important for competition. If you don't like your web hosting company, you can just move your information to another. You can change domain all the time. So we should think of interoperability as important to content creation, as important to user rights, as important to the actual thriving economy of the internet. And you're right to talk about the ways in which those are not managed by a central for profit body. But ultimately, we can reduce it to a simple idea. It's expanding the network effects of everything that you do online, but that doesn't exist in the virtual world. Roblox individual worlds can identify one another, but they have no ability to understand, least of all, even identify another virtual world. Be it in Fortnite, an educational forum, a training sample.Communicating from one live services suite to another doesn't really exist either. There's no consistent way to store information. And least of all, the ability to take a 3D object whether it's created for industrial purposes for a simulation. Northrop Grumman wants to test an engine and then see how it performs in a specific environment. They don't really have a cohesive way to take that object from one simulation to another. So this question about interoperability is really about expanding the utility, practical applicability of everything in the metaverse. And I'll drop this down to a simpler example. The world economy of course runs on standards, defacto and otherwise. And it's essential to reducing the friction to all transactions to increasing the utility of all investments and purchases. What are those standards? USD is one. English is another. The metric system is a third. The intermodal shipping container. You'll note of course that there are often many other standards. We also use the Euro. We also use German. There are multiple different types of shipping containers, not all intermodal. Metric and imperial sit side-by-side, often in the same country, often within the same business. So we shouldn't think of interoperability from a panacea perspective. And this is one of the flaws I'm often asked, can we ever have interoperability? Yes, we'll never have it perfectly, never have it exhaustively. The world doesn't work that way. The internet doesn't work that way. We still have private networks, offline networks. We still have paid and proprietary protocols. You often need an installer to access experience A or B, and there are often paywalls. But making it so that every 3D object, every experience, more purchases can move, can endure, have utility beyond that first creation is going to be key to actually building up this economy. Patrick: Help me understand how we can bridge that gap of something I build, own, earn, achieve in some place that I want to bring to some place else. If I think about games, and maybe that's the wrong way to think about it. The object I win and spend hours looking for in Diablo is really not relevant in Fortnite, is really not relevant in Sims. It seems like even though there are all these great worlds, the idea of bringing stuff between them is hard to imagine because the worlds themselves are so different. So how do you think this happens? How does Roblox get connected to Fortnite? How far down do we have to go to build the bridge? Matthew: One of the challenges with interoperability discussions is that we often focus on the easiest to understand, but arguably the least useful example. And that is taking your Peely banana skin from Fortnite and bringing it into Call of Duty. There are so many problems with that. The engines of course are different. And I just want to highlight how different these engines often are. Unity and Unreal actually have different coordinate systems for X, Y, Z. They store information Y and Z differently. Now that's easy for a computer to manage. You just have a translator. It works the same way that English to German does. You say let's swap Y and Z. But if they have fundamental disagreements on coordinates, you can imagine how sophisticated some of the disagreements are. That naturally leads game designers in particular to say, ""Why does that matter?"" Putting aside the economic considerations, do you want to be appealing in Call of Duty? Is it cohesive with the aesthetic? Does it fit in a doorframe? Frankly, the Peely file format might be stored in a way that makes it three stories tall in Call of Duty. When you look at my metaverse definition, I talk about the continuity of data from 3D objects to entitlements, payments, communications, history. The object itself, the avatar is probably the least important element of that. We're a little bit more concerned with when you do an educational exercise in school, 3D simulation in school is probably one of the most important innovations that we can see. We've learned that distanced education is terrible. We have long expected the advent of the internet and digital devices to see productivity improvements in education. Haven't happened. We know that multiple choice is terrible, that playing a YouTube video is terrible, that Zoom school is terrible. But the ability to make real The Magic School Bus is intuitive.I grew up making volcanoes out of paper mache, baking soda, and vinegar. Now, you can start to do that in realistic simulations where you are personally agitating the magma being ejected into the atmosphere, and seeing the time lapse implications on the environment. Building a Rube Goldberg machine to learn physics, rather than just watching a video of a NASA commander drop a feather and hammer on the moon. You can take that Rube Goldberg machine to the moon, to Mars and Venus. But of course, we believe that some form of interoperability or continuity of what you've done, and what that information is, and who you are is essential. We're not going to have the same school pack for chemistry as for English. So it's not as important that I take my banana skin from A to B, it's more important that I can consistently manage my profile. But all of this requires formats, more importantly conventions, a whole bunch of other buzzwords. Frameworks of frameworks, systems of systems. But how does it emerge? It emerges in a well known way, the same way that USD and English did. It's often network effects reiterated the incentives of changing systems. But again, never perfectly. Last week, we had the establishment by the Khronos foundation, the metaverse standards form 28 companies. Many notable omissions, Apple, Google, many other content providers. But Epic, and Meta, and so forth, Qualcomm all saying, ""Let's start to standardize our roadmap. We have to understand what we can build towards for the collective utility."" That's the easiest step. No one has to make a sacrifice to their tech roadmap. No one has to pick a standard they didn't like. But that formation period has already begun. And even Roblox has started talking extensively about their need for their developer economy to start to figure this out. Patrick: Payments is something you mentioned there that I think is unbelievably interesting. Alongside identity, the thing that does move around everywhere with everyone, it's their identity and their ability to spend. What is the story with payments in the metaverse? Is it going to be a US dollar stable coin? Is it going to be Ethereum? Ethereum is so fascinating because it's a payment rail that allows you to move more money faster anytime than anything we've ever seen. And we saw that with some of the crazy NFT purchases. What will drive commerce, and value, and what will be that standard in your estimation? And what needs to be built to make payments as a core primitive possible in the metaverse. Matthew: I think we have to start from a fundamental premise that is the importance of the efficient, low-cost, ubiquitous standardized payment rails to the success of any economy. Fluid mobility of capital, easy transactions. Those are important obviously. And by the way, it's worth rattling off some of the forecasts. Obviously the forecasts are difficult. Many are doing top down. Some are doing bottoms up. But McKinsey puts the metaverse at 5 trillion by the end of the decade, Citibank up to 13 trillion by the end of the decade. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley 8 trillion by the end of the decade. KPMG has said they think those forecasts are all modest, that it's going to be blown out. The efficacy of the underlying payment service is key. But the biggest challenge is the way in which the metaverse isn't just something you go out and access. It may be a persistent, ubiquitous virtual simulation. But you need a way to access it. And right now, all of the major platforms are contending with one another to be that primary payment gateway. They want to effectively take a fee on all economic activity in the virtual world. And that's a great business. Of course they should. It makes sense for them to do so. Putting aside the fundamental question of USD, or USDC, or Ethereum, we're starting to see this play out. Who is going to be the payment processor for this extraordinary virtual economy? Six days before epic sued Apple, but of course we know they were long planning it. Tim tweeted out that Apple had outlawed the metaverse. This was based on multiple different ideas.First and foremost, he's saying that Apple's take rate or 30% is so significantly constraining developer profits, that it makes it impractical for most people to build in the metaverse. Also made the argument that Apple was stymieing certain technologies, which were likely to be essential to the metaverse. And then thirdly, that Apple was affecting all other peripherals that need to use your iPhone as an edge computer or edge server in order to be effective. One of the ways to solve for the difficulty of having high powered AR devices is to instead of reduplicating the GPU or SOC, it's to put a lightweight thing in the thing you wear on your face, and then ride off the super powerful thing in your pocket. But of course, Apple gatekeeps which APIs and programs you can access so that you can divert it to their app store. In other instances, there are widely deployed interoperable standards that Apple cripples. There are good arguments and skeptical arguments for that. But one would be OpenGL or WebGL, which are common standards for API collections for rendering that allow for sophisticated browser based graphics, which means a game can run anywhere, on any device, consistently in cross platform. But it's not really possible on the iPhone. The reason why I do this long tangent is if payment rails are critical to the success of all economy, if the payment rails are operated by the hardware provider, and the hardware providers are fighting hard to make sure that they take a cut on the entire metaverse, then this whole question is held up. When you talk about cryptocurrencies, we can see the best example of them.You can buy cryptocurrency in Robinhood. What you can't do is buy a non fungible token. So you can buy a fungible token, like Ethereum. You can't buy a non fungible token. Why? Because those are used for game like purchases in-game or virtual currency. There's no technical reason why Apple prohibits one versus another, but of course as a commercial one as relates to their app store business. But then we can actually test that theory. You and I can of course fractionalize an NFT into a million different fungible ownership stakes in that NFT, but that's flawed two. I'm not saying that this is the right way or the wrong way, but to some extent, this question of what's the economy going to look like, what's the payment service. It's still at the mercy of the platforms that be, and the regulators that may or may not change them. And it also explains the question we started, which is why is Facebook spending billions on their own platform? And the answer is they perhaps more than any have felt the repercussions of trying to build a virtual or even digital business on someone else's. The app tracking and transparency impact took 10 billion out of operating cash flow in 2022. That's just a single year. Their cloud gaming business is just not allowed on iPhones. And their creator program basically doesn't work because the cut that they have to pay to the mobile app store exceeds the net cut that's going to go to them, and merely matches that which would go to the creator. This is one of the fundamental premises. It's why Tim would say Apple has outlawed the metaverse, and why Tim would go to such lengths to convince regulators something has to be done.",3096
53,Matthew Ball - A Manual to The Metaverse,What to Expect from Consumer Demand and Behavior," Patrick: If you think about all of this, so much of the infrastructure and everything we've talked about is related to the supply side. Our ability to deliver this concept to billions of people at once. We haven't talked a ton about the demand side, and I had a fascinating conversation with the founder of Second Life in Bill Gurley about what if there's just not enough demand for this? What if we're assuming that everyone's going to want to be in this metaverse, but when we show up with it as a solution, the demand's not there, and it's a solution in search of a problem? What do you make of that criticism that perhaps the demand is a lot smaller for this kind of thing relative to the normal world, the normal verse. And that that will ultimately be a constraint on its growth. Matthew: We shouldn't think of the metaverse as a replacement to the internet or today's devices. I often use the phrase quasi successor. And that's because it won't actually succeed everything technologically. And it won't replace everything that we do today. Think about mobile. Mobile is still TCP/IP for the most part. We recognize its devices, its use cases. Many of the company's business models is different, but we're still running on TCP/IP. Most traffic now originates and terminates at a mobile device, but all of the transmission is over fixed line infrastructure. Many of us still use non mobile devices. My PC is most of my time online. To believe in the metaverse doesn't mean that we have to believe we'll do everything all the time in it. It's very likely that we continue to send text messages and send emails. Often do video calls the same way that we do it today. But when you're talking about the demand for it, there are two other answers. Number one is generational. At its peak, usually dated around 2005, 2006, Second Life had a few million monthly active users. It's quite possible that this very moment, Roblox has more concurrent users than Second Life did at its peak in a month. It is roughly 5 to 6 million peak CCUs in a day. It has 55 million DAUs, 250 million MAUs.Not only are we seeing non-linear increases each decade, but we see this fundamentally on a generational basis. 75% of children in most Western markets, the US, UK, New Zealand, Canada use Roblox on a regular basis between the ages of nine and 12. And that's before talking about Minecraft and other platforms. I like to point to the advent of Roblox in contrast to its popularity. When you take a look at Roblox, company founded in 2004, released its first product in 2006. It wasn't really until 2016 that the platform started to take off. By 2018, it's one of the most popular experiences globally. By 2020, it's doing 2 billion hours per month pre pandemic. It's now at four and a half billion hours per month. The rise of Roblox in 2016 coincides exactly with a point in time in which the iPad native generation, infants we used to laugh at because they would pick up a TIME Magazine, pinch to zoom, double tap, swipe, only to realize it doesn't work. That's just when they became Roblox users. And when they became able to use Roblox, their behaviors were entirely different and they've endured. Gen Y games more than X, Gen Z, more than Y, Gen A more than Z. Nearly everyone born today is a gamer. That's 140 million new gamers per year. I don't worry about that generational transition. It's clear when we've seen it multiple times. With the early web, with the browser based homepage, with social. And then with more immersive forms of social. Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok.The second and final answer is to recognize that we're kind of starting from this perspective of the metaverse as consumer leisure. We get so anchored around Ready Player One, jumping off to school or for some virtual coins while wearing a Captain America avatar. We are already seeing cities invest heavily in operating real-time, persistent virtual simulations. Airports doing the same thing. It's this industrial application, this simulation of us when we don't even know it. Whether it's an Amazon Go retail store, or just when we're being managed as flow of traffic in an airport when they need to gate change. That's most of the way in which we're going to interact. And then when you take a look at these new devices. Again, I'm not going to conflate this exactly with the Metaverse. Last fall, Johns Hopkins performed its first ever live patient surgery using an XR device. The head of the spinal surgery department, the person who performed the surgery has said that it was like driving a car with GPS for the first time. And I love this analogy, because we often think of the metaverse or metaverse-like devices as substitutes.I'm going to use my Oculus instead of my PlayStation. I'm going to use my Oculus instead of watching TV. But you don't drive GPS instead of a car. You drive your car with GPS, and you evaluate its efficacy based on outcomes such as getting there faster, better, safer, more easily. And that's the same with patient outcomes. That's the same with how you learn in school, through 3D simulation. That's the big thing that's exciting here. And it doesn't really require you to believe in how many people want to gamify their existence. You just have to believe in the utility of 3D simulation, the importance of graphics based computing, and a recognition that in many instances, the most important things we own, real estate. So the largest asset class. The most important things we do, healthcare are actually barely online. Barely intelligent. The world's largest and most important software development platform is the world itself. And we have almost no collaboration with data, least of all in real time. And when we do, it's basic. What's average foot track outside of store. What's the simulated impact of the society around us. Patrick: Blake Robbins who's now at Benchmark and I've talked to a lot about various aspects of this. Asked an interesting question the other day, which is what is the modern equivalent of a lemonade stand for kids? The first business that they have. And maybe it's Roblox, maybe it's already happening. But as you think about the metaverse, how do you think about meta businesses? I think that's the term you use in the book. Small businesses that get started in a persistent digital world like this, and what they might look like. Consumer leisure is where it's starting. Things tend towards economy, toward business, towards small business. What will be the lemonade stands of the metaverse in your opinion? Matthew: This is a really fun one. I love this chart, because it has existed for decades. And this is taking a look at the spend of allowance in the United States. And if you go back even to 2019, and I've just pulled up the chart, number one is books. Then it's gifts, candy. Roblox comes in number four. And then Lego is number five. When you get to the second quarter of 2020, let's keep in mind we are in the pandemic. But let's put in contrast what the other things were. Gifts, books, magazine, candy. Those aren't pre-pandemic, but not post-pandemic uses of spend. But by the second quarter of the pandemic, number one was Roblox, number two was Fortnite, number three was Lego, number four was Minecraft. We see this in spend certainly. But the answer of what the first business is, is creating an object in Roblox, throwing it up on the marketplace, creating a world. And we see a form of this at large. Kids who buy sneakers and then try to flip them. I actually had a Blackberry flipping business in the early 2000s and late 1990s that transitioned into an iPhone business. I would buy them on Craigslist or in bulk, import them, and then flip them through a marketplace. We actually live in a pretty marketplace and capitalist organized society. The idea that the thing that you're good at. In my case, it was consumer tech and trends should for many, translate into monetizable skills. So the idea that kids love creating things in these virtual environments and then love to sell them, that they would demonstrate their success based on the success of those creations financially is intuitive. It's consistent with sneaker buying, with fractionalized sneakers, trading cards, and more. Patrick: It seems like so much of this is going to be eating more and more of our time. You mentioned television and the crazy hours in the day that we spend on that. And that could all go into this new world. Some key feature of this is that it seems more active. The participation in it is much more active than sitting on the couch. You're doing more stuff. You're responding to more things. Makes me think of Marshall McLuhan's work on hot and cold media. How do you think that figures into this? Do you think that one of the reasons people watch TV is because it's so passive? And will the metaverse just have the Travis Scott concert, something? Isn't that participatory? Do I have this idea right? That it feels like this would be something you participate in more than just observe. Matthew: Let's start with your observation on why television is popular. I think this is an underestimated thing. We think of the bundle in terms of multiple different competitors. We rarely think about the bundle of many different content types. But more importantly, bundles of different functions, and bundles of different consumption. Sometimes you watch TV to be entertained, other times to be informed, other times to culturally participate. Sometimes, it's to practice or participate in some form of local tribalism, sports most obviously. But it's also a bundle of different types of engagement. There's lean in as I like to call it. That's 9:00 PM. You're watching Game of Thrones. The lights are off. The kids are asleep. Your phone is put on silent. There's lean back. That might be watching a comedy. And then there's disengaged. It's passive. It's doing homework while The Office is on in the background, you're ironing, you're doing laundry. You're watching your kids. That's a huge part of why we have five and a half hours per day. Certainly gaming is getting there at large. Twitch brings a lot of that. There are many people who no longer play AAA games. They participate in them by watching someone else do it. There are many different content formats that are coming into play.In July, one of my portfolio companies, Genvid is releasing The Walking Dead: Last Mile co-created and written by Robert Kirkman who created The Walking Dead. And it is a persistent, multi-week simulation that's canonical to The Walking Dead universe. You can put your own avatar into the world, control the community, vote on what they do, help them. But you don't steer. You don't actually control a character. You're participating with others. You're participating as a specific person in the field, but you're not hands-on controller. You're not certainly doing that 24 hours per day. So we see diversification. But for all of TV's advantages in formats, even if they're getting whittled away, 65% of time watching television is still done solitary on the couch. That's still in excess of two and a half hours per day. That is the specific time that gaming is most likely to come after, that the metaverse is most likely to come after. And frankly, which is most easily observed in younger demographics. I play Fortnite with a squad of 10 others. We have a great time. I have this element of yeah, it's 9:00 PM on a Tuesday. And I'm excited to watch the latest episode of a show. But that actually for me, much like millions of others means choosing to do something for myself and missing out on shared activity. It might actually be easier. I might be exhausted. But the social lift that comes from that experience is hard to skip. Patrick: Do you think there's a dark side that's worth discussing to all this as someone that's just got done with Jonathan Haidt's new work on the terror of social media for young people specifically. And it's starting to seem like maybe this is our cigarettes or something, where certain aspects of social accelerate or magnify the worst in us and lead to some terrifying things. Especially for young people. The metaverse seems like a deeper version of all that. Everything gets sped up to the speed of thought, because there's no limits on what's possible communication-wise or what have you. How do you think about all of that? There's so much exciting here. Like any technology it's sort of amoral and can be used for bad too. What are your thoughts on the dark side of the metaverse? Matthew: I want to bubble this up a little bit. We're 15 years or so into the mobile cloud social era of computing and networking. And there are many big problems that we have encountered and which we're still struggling to solve. Data rights, data security, data literacy, platform power, platform regulation. Abuse, harassment, toxicity, happiness. The role of algorithms in our life, miss and disinformation, radicalization. That's a long list. And the metaverse is going to make all of those more challenging. Why? Because it means more of society is going to be online for more and more important purposes. You're right. I agree with you that technology amoral, but that means that those four mentioned challenges don't get easier. They get harder. The implications of getting them wrong increases. Radicalization is scary in 2D social. It's terrifying in 3D space, and decentralization makes that more terrifying still. There are some lessons we have learned over the past 15 years, certainly. But some of them won't reapply to 3D space for that reason.At the same time, I'm optimistic for a few different reasons. First and foremost, we have learned what to do at least as the platform shifts. And that is to say we're more cognizant of these problems as a platform shift occurs. Number two, the very reason why all of the largest companies on earth, seven of the 11 largest, GAFAM plus Nvidia and Tencent are gearing up for this new wave. Why? Because they know what happens when a platform shift occurs. It's likely that some rise or fall. Business models change, philosophies change. And what that means is that we. And by we, I mean consumers, users, developers, content creators actually have an incredible agency affecting who is going to lead and how they lead. Really hard intro cycle. We've encountered this. That's one of the reasons why regulation has challenged. But much easier on a new cycle. I do think that we can reset a lot of this. In a simple sense, very few people knew the term disruption. Very few people thought about it. That has become mainstream. We're all smarter as to what happens, and we're starting to get to that frontier.",3279
54,Matthew Ball - A Manual to The Metaverse,Potential Future Winners and Losers," Patrick: If you think about the companies behind all this, we've mentioned a bunch of their names. I don't even necessarily mean specific companies, but you can answer it that way too. Who do you think of as the categorical winners and losers assuming much of what you've talked about today comes to pass that in 10 years time or 20 years time, there is tons of participation in immersion in the metaverse, as you've described it? What kinds of companies will do well? What kinds of companies will do poorly? For whom is this a disruptive force that is going to come out of left field and really impair their business? Generally the winners and losers from this trend. Matthew: Let me start philosophically. If we look over the preceding three eras, we can identify and learn many things. For example, they have led to such fundamental changes in who accesses computing and networking resources. Where, when, why, and how. And that leads to fundamental change in even the most stagnant of industries. We had the rise of new communications suites such as Skype disrupting legacy telephony services in the '90s. We also had the advent of PayPal around that same era, a new payment network. You fast forward to the start of the mobile era, and you see that happen again. Venmo isn't just PayPal, Shopify not just PayPal. Stripe, not just a mobile form of PayPal. Communications are actually more clear. WeChat doesn't try to talk to traditional PSTN, nor does slack, nor does Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp. But they function on a mobile first experience. You take a look at Twilio, Twilio does talk to PSTN like Skype. But it does so for fundamentally different reasons. And of course, Slack is based on integration into enterprise and productivity APIs. And then of course, we can take a look at the operating system layer. You see the advent of iOS and Android built around fundamental different premises. And in some instances, different degrees of vertical integration than Windows did. This template says that in most categories, we see displacement or at least the emergence of new players that do different things. And in this proto metaverse era, one can argue we see that today. In payment services, we see Coinbase, MetaMask, FTX. In communications, we see Discord, gaming services such as PlayFab or GameSpark, Epic Online Services. And on the operating system, you may see Unreal Roblox or Unity. Yes, they run on iOS and Android. But they do disintermediate the platforms from both the developer who now creates in Roblox, and the user who now experiences in Roblox.What does that mean for this era? I like to think about five different types of corporate fortunes. Some giants will die. We've seen this clearly. Blockbuster, America Online. Category two are the companies that languish, but survive and end up far surpassed. Yahoo of course still exists. Nobody pays much heed. Skype still exists, but it's so insignificant to Microsoft that it doesn't even use the name with its Teams platform, which of course functions on different premises. Other companies will adapt and grow because of growth in the digital economy. Facebook not of the mobile era, but much larger as a result of it. Disney even older still, but is bigger and reaches more customers more frequently. Category four is the interesting one. It's companies that are displaced, but nevertheless grow because of such extraordinary growth in the digital economy. Or I should say displaced in their core business. IBM and Microsoft more valuable over this last decade than at the peak of their power, when it came to operating systems and consumer hardware. Because they've gone horizontal, and the digital tan has grown so extraordinary. And then we have this fifth category. The most fun one, which is the new companies that emerge. Google this last wave, Unity, TikTok as we start to into this new era. Those are the five core archetypes that I look like in this next wave. But what's fascinating here is understanding that we're still at the thesis driven era. The best practices don't exist. And the theses really matter. A lot of people like to make fun of Steve Ballmer in January of 2007 when he's asked about the iPhone. He laughs and says $500 without a keyboard. And of course it is funny. But we often forget, and the clips often remove the part where he says it may do well and good and it looks like a good device, but his point is that they believe their strategy is right. And they had five different bets. They believed that the smartphone was going to be the secondary computing device, not the primary. They believed that it was going to be business led, not consumer led. They believed that it had to have a keyboard rather than the space was best reallocated. They believed that it was going to be best priced at the 200 to $500 price point, not $500 and above. And they believed that the monetization model was OS licensing, not app stores or hardware.Microsoft probably would have a mobile phone division which they deprecated in 2017 finally, if they got two or three of those wrong. It was the number that they got wrong that led to displacement in that category, shifting it to a horizontal company. Facebook wasn't displaced in its core market in the mobile era, unlike Microsoft. But we kind of forget how close they were. I love when people bring up Facebook's pivot to mobile, because it's one of the most rapid at scale pivots that we've seen. In four quarters in 2012, they went from 4% mobile revenue to 23%. Huge shift. I write about this in my book. It's because they were backed up. They were a launch app on the App Store in 2008, but their app was HTML5. It was a thin client that basically loaded a web browser. And it was terrible. Mark was a big advocate for HTML5. While the App Store came out in 2008, the there's an app for that campaign came out in 2009. In 2010, Sesame Street parodied that campaign. It was still another two years until Facebook actually built a native app for iOS. Within one month, they doubled engagement time in the app. Imagine any business that could do as simple a change as just go from HTML5 to native code on iOS to double their most important metric. That pivot was actually a reflection of errors in thesis for years. Mark called it at TechCrunch Disrupt the greatest strategic mistake the company made. And the company at that point was eight years old. They got out of that. They made the change in time. But let's also remember when WhatsApp was founded in 2009, the premise was native app messaging. Facebook had 350 million users as a head start. By the end of 2014 when they acquired WhatsApp, WhatsApp had 200 million more mobile users, and they spent 20 billion acquiring them. Instagram created as a native app image service, something again that Facebook didn't do. And Facebook bought the company. That success, the fact that Facebook was in that third category came from not the right theses originally, but a quick shift after and an expensive one. And now we look at the world where acquisitions are less likely. They do have Oculus from nearly a decade ago, $2 billion, twice what they spent on Instagram. But the doors are fewer. I get excited as a public markets investor taking a look at these theses beds. And we're still at that stage. What is the right bet? We don't know. Microsoft is focused on enterprise AR at the $3,500 price point. We know that Facebook is focused on consumer AR at a much lower price point. We're seeing this exact same case play out. Different UI design principles, different focus audiences, different devices, different price points. That's fun. Patrick: If people want to just go experience some of what is currently available that relates to our conversation today. It could be a game. It could be a device. What would be the top couple things that you think are most fun, interesting, useful to understand the current state of the world's technology as it relates to the metaverse? Matthew: I love Epic's Matrix Awakens demo. And what they've done is you can download this on next generation consoles and I believe on PC. This enormous procedurally generated city from The Matrix, and the visuals are terrific. But what's amazing about it is what you can customize. You can change the time of day instantly and dynamically. As in you want to go from 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM, you shift by minute. And you can see how it affects the refraction of every light ray. You can change the density of people's that change the density of cars. There's something like 63,000 cars you can just drive up to, and you can damage them naturally. But more importantly, you can play in the settings to take a look at how many triangles there are, how many different identifiable items there are. As you can see when you move closer to the world, how its visual fidelity increases. What you're seeing is basically an extraordinarily complex living city that is made out of software. And therefore, and I'd steal this term from your interview with the Planet Labs founder, entirely legible to software. There's nothing in it that can't be modified and crucially modified in real time. And that's what's key. If you play around with this, you fly, you take a look at the time of day, the style, the aesthetics, and you start to think about what does that feel like when it's being used to run infrastructure. The Hong Kong International Airport didn't use Unity, because it's better at architectural rendering. Obviously that's going to be an Autodesk product. But it's much better at simulation. If you want to make live decisions, what happens when there's a fire, a terrorist attack, a backup on the runway, a flood. You now have real simulation. We're used to a world where you want to shift a plane from one gate to another based on how close that gate is. But now if you actually have a real-time simulation, you understand actually it's better for everyone. If we move from gate 82 to gate 61. Because of the risk of an accident because of the flow of people, because we can simulate the impact. And frankly, we might want to optimize for commerce in the airport.Nvidia's new headquarter was designed with a dynamic understanding of exactly how every light particle at every day of the year with density in every individual room would be affected. So you design for a more environmental while also a more enjoyable building based on the fact that the entire thing can be simulated in real time. When you start to play in the Matrix demo, you start to understand what that is. Because it's not a game. It's not a trivial thing. It's a complex ecosystem. One of my favorite examples to talk about is Tampa's Water Street development program. This is essentially what happens when you take that Nvidia example and say, let's apply it to the world's development platform. This is a multi-billion dollar waterfront redevelopment. Supporting it, the development partner created an 11 foot in diameter 3D printed scale model with a network of different projection cameras so that you could see the city live. Where is traffic? What's the temperature? What's the flow? But they also did the design in Unreal. And that presented all of these additional opportunities. You could for example, see how changing building four from 11 to 17 stories would affect congestion and traffic times throughout the entire city. You could understand what happens when you shift the car park from the north to the south entrance. Whether or not you need another emergency medical services depot closer to that building because of the implications that were made. You can understand how those buildings are going to affect light in a local park, the temperature of that park at certain times of year. And of course, you could have individuals go into the 11th floor and see their view, and frankly see how their view would be affected by the other buildings that they design. The deployment of this technology, which was for toyetic purposes, has matured to a point in which we can deploy in our entire world for better investment or better real-time decision making. And when you jump into Matrix and start to ask this question, what if it's used in the world around us? For me at least, it was instantaneous. Patrick: It's two amazing examples. The first one is so fun, I've done that demo and it's wild. And then of course you realize it's just a point in time and it's all going to keep getting better. And the second one in the utility if you will of that example is so damn interesting. I'm so thankful for the time today and for the book. If anyone's read Matt's essays on this topic on the website over the years, it's yet deeper explorations of all the key ideas that make up the metaverse. And obviously, it's the definitive piece of content if you want to learn about this topic. But I just love talking to you. You're so encyclopedic in your awareness of all the little tiny details about what's going on. And this is an incredibly exciting trend that I hope to continue to watch with you. So thank you so much for doing this for a second time, and thanks so much for your time today. Matthew: Thank you. It was a real pleasure.This site uses cookies to improve your browsing experience.

55,Alice Bentinck - Building a Start-Up Machine,Introduction," Patrick: My guest today is Alice Bentinck, co-founder of Entrepreneur First. Entrepreneur First, or EF invests pre-company by systematizing the way that talented individuals find co-founders, develop ideas, and scale into companies. They're an incubator of teams and ideas on a mission to create impactful companies that without their help wouldn't exist. I first spoke with Alice's co-founder Matt Clifford over two years ago, and have been fascinated with EF's model of investing ever since. Please enjoy my conversation with Alice Bentinck.",127
56,Alice Bentinck - Building a Start-Up Machine,Building a Factory for Startups," Patrick: So Alice, I've been looking forward to this one. We've had to push it back a few times, but actually it's been a good thing because the world of investing in early stage companies has changed quite a lot since the first one of these that we had scheduled maybe at the end of last year. You are one of the co-founders with Matt Clifford of Entrepreneurs First, and because it's a very interesting international organization that effectively produces new companies, I'd love you to just start by giving an overview of what EF looks like today, before we get into all the origins and the history and the way you operate, which are all really interesting. Alice: Entrepreneur First is a talent investor, and broadly what that means is that we invest pre-team, pre-idea. So the first money we deploy is into a individual rather than into a company. Pre-seed investing has become increasingly sexy and attractive over the last couple of years, as valuations have gone through the roof, but really the reason that we do this is because we believe that the world is missing out and some of its best founders. The supply of founders is currently constrained, and largely constrained because of two things. One, a lack of network density in many ecosystems outside of Silicon Valley, and then two, and I think this one often surprises people that are based in or around Silicon Valley, the ambition track of many local cultures of many of the world's best cities is that you see many of the most talented individuals caught in careers that may not be the best way to optimize their outcomes. For example, Singapore, you go into the civil service. London, you go into banking. These are very culturally approved career paths for the most ambitious. It's what your peers want you to do. It's what your careers advisors, what your professors, what your parents want you to do. At EF we tackle these two challenges. So we have a program, it runs in six locations across the world, six countries across the world, across Europe, Asia, and we're also in Canada as well. And the point of this program is to take an individual from the point where they're considering, they're curious, they're just thinking about becoming a founder, all the way through to the stage where they're seed funded.So one of the key things that we do is we've built an environment that enables strangers to become co-founders. So you join with between 50 and 80 other individuals, and you have an eight week period to find a co-founder from within that pool. So about 80% find a co-founder. Of the companies that are then created through those co-founding teams, they go to our investment committee, we invest in about half the companies that are created, and then we spend another three months working with them to get to their seed round. So we're an unusual beast in a way, because we are a company, we operate like a company, we've got 120 people working across these fixed locations, finding the people and supporting the creation of the companies, investing and supporting the companies to get their seed rounds. But we also do manage capital. So we have about $350 million in funds at the moment. One of the big changes we've just made is that our most recent fundraise we did on the balance sheet rather than into a fund vehicle. And I can talk a little bit about why we did that, but we've been going for 10 years in London, which was our first location, but we've backed now over 3,000 founders, we have more than 600 companies in our portfolio. The total valuation now is about eight and half billion dollars. So yeah, we've been going for a while. It took us a while to actually perfect this model of talent investing. We're very well positioned to capture this pre-seed market. Patrick: As part of the latest fundraise that you did myself, it was fascinating to learn about, I'll call it a factory that you've built now across six cities, for doing what you just described, and I'm really interested in the various stages of the assembly line, if you will. Not to overdo the analogy. Starting with the people. So if you've got this concept of there's talent that could be unlocked in geographies, outside of Silicon Valley, and then you're very good at pairing them up, evaluating them, investing in them, these are all discrete steps, and I'd really love to learn what you've discovered over all these years across all these cities about doing this well. So we'll go in order. How do you identify the right kind of people, the 50 to 80 people or whatever, to bring into each city cohort each year? So what kind of attributes are you looking for? And how you convince them to leave a job, to change course or change path to come do this with you for eight weeks. Alice: One of the strongly held beliefs that we definitely challenge is that you can't turn someone into a founder. I disagree with this because what we're doing is we're not turning people into a founder. We're releasing them from whatever ambition trap. Most people are default employed. They're not default founders outside of Silicon Valley. So EF's job is basically to raise awareness of why being a founder is the most important thing that you can do with your life. So we have a bunch of ways that we dig out these people. So first of all, we have a big team. So we have about 40 people worldwide whose sole job is to find talent. So our job is to go into places where great talent does already aggregate. So if you look at somewhere like Singapore, it's already one of the world's best talent aggregating cities. It's got amazing universities like NUS and NTU that pull in the best talent from around the region. If you look at somewhere like London, it pulls in a lot of the best talent from around Europe and Europe, even Brexit withstanding. So we go to cities where there's already a very, very strong talent pool. We like cities where there is a very strong university ecosystem, largely because we find the universities are some of the best talent aggregators in the world. People will move. The most ambitious will say, ""Hey, I'm not going to settle for my second rate local university. I am going to move to somewhere that will raise my ambition level."" We have very deep relationships with the universities that mean that we can understand who is coming through this system and who is fighting that system. As they are going through the academic career path, are they the ones that are actually saying, ""Hey, it's not enough just to produce papers. I actually want to get out there and produce and build and get my technology out into the world.""In some ways, the technologist's the easiest to find, those potential CTOs, and there's often much stronger trails that they leave behind them, whether it's their commits on GitHub, whether it's their activity in different tech communities. Often the hardest people to find are actually the potential CEOs. Now we like CEOs who have lightly technical backgrounds. So maybe they did a computer science degree, but they never actually used it. Maybe they did a bunch of building when were a teenager, but then didn't keep it going. But if you think about a large part of EF's beauty is making these co-founding teams work. So you need to have co-founders who understand each other's language. So having that degree of technical understanding from CEO, we find as super, super important. But finding the CEOs, they often have far more diverse backgrounds, more unusual backgrounds. So for CEOs, what we find is rather than trying to find aggregated pools of CEOs, what we're doing is using our talent scouting network, which is both our team, and individuals that we then incentivize to find these people and infiltrate different networks to try and help us hunt down these people and get them in front of us. And then our job is to help convince them that actually the opportunity cost in life is not doing the startup. The opportunity cost is not the salary that you're missing by quitting your job. The opportunity cost is if you do have a billion dollar company inside you, think about the opportunity cost of not building that and staying in the job where you're waiting for the promotion, waiting for the pay rise, waiting for whatever culturally approved carrot you've been offered. It's as much an art as it is a science, and talent preferences change really quickly. So something that might have worked a couple of years ago goes out of fashion, communities change, and we need to adapt as well. Patrick: If you had to categorize the type of people that are coming into the program into students, people already working, maybe some different age ranges, give me a sense for where people tend to be coming from. What are the major groups? Alice: The average number of years of experience post-graduation is probably about five. We'll take fresh people straight out of university. We'll take people with six to eight years experience as well. But what we find is that EF does work best, our current product, which is called Form works best for those that are first time founders and that are at the beginning of their career. We have probably now about 20, 25% of people that join us that have a PhD, so have an advanced technical background, PhD or postdoc. About 60% of the people that we work with have some sort of technical background and the rest have a very light technical, no technical background. And they are typically at the point where maybe they haven't... Because startups have become much more normalized across many of our locations, maybe they've tried something once. Maybe when they're at university, they tried to start something up. They tried to find a co-founder, they've dipped their toe, but they haven't really fully committed before joining.And I suppose one of the most important parts of EF is that to join EF you have to fully commit. You have to quit your job. Our promise to individuals that join us is that you're joining a group of individuals who are fully focused on finding a co-founder, fully focused on founding a company. I think one of the challenges that we see in locations where you don't have high network density of other potential co-founders is that you find somebody, you have the conversation, you want to become a co-founder together, you start experimenting, and then they get a job or they get a promotion and suddenly they've gone, and everything that you've been trying to create together suddenly goes up in flames. So I think EF probably this pool of fully committed potential co-founders in the world. Every six months we have 300 people who join us who have all quit their jobs, who are already to go right now. And if you were curious about startups, if you're just the beginning of thinking of getting startup, this promise that you can find a co-founder fast and effectively is like catnip. Patrick: Maybe just list the six cities, because we're going to reference them a lot. You mentioned London and Singapore. What are the other four? Alice: So in Europe, we're London, Paris, Berlin. Asia, we're in Singapore, Bangalore. And then in North America, we're in Toronto.",2426
57,Alice Bentinck - Building a Start-Up Machine,Screening to Avoid Failure," Patrick: As you think about these people, and I love that filter of to join you have to be fully committed to this idea. What have you learned about negative screening at that first stage? What are the most effective ways that you keep out? In addition to saying you have to be fully committed so the non fully committed, hopefully wouldn't join. What are other negative signals that you've learned about over the years for creating that initial pool? Alice: I mean the simplest question that produces the most effective answers on commitment is what are you considering if you don't get EF? If you don't get to join EF. And actually it's the people that list out a long list of very culturally approved career path next steps that typically don't do very well in the program. Patrick: Burn the boats mentality, so to speak. Alice: You've got to burn the boats. We do believe in activating talent, but that doesn't mean everyone should be activated, nor being ambitious and super smart isn't enough. That doesn't default make you a great founder. We don't believe that everyone in the world should be a founder. But what we're trying to do is make sure that we do screen out those that are dabbling, that are trying to do it because it has become cooler or more- Patrick: Sexy or something. Alice: Sexy, yeah. I think when you look at the big risk of EF is that we build insecure or shady co-founder relationships. So our selection process has to be super robust to ensure that only the most motivated, only the most active of the pool that we are screening... We're screening about 35,000 applications over the life cycle of the fund. One of the most important things is just making sure that those that get in are fully, fully committed to founding a company at the point where they join us. Patrick: In addition to commitment, what are some of the other positive screens? What have you learned to scan for in candidates and really favor when it comes to admissions? Alice: We're lucky now that having done this for 10 years, we can see how the lead signals that we used to evaluate have then translated into results. There's a couple of things that just consistently have reliably shown us who's going to be a top performer in their cohort. The first is that people who believe that they can do it and believe that their odds are different to their peers is not a slam dunk that they will then be the top performer in their cohort, but it is necessary for them to succeed. So we call this having high personal exceptionalism. So this individual who just believes that their odds are different. It shouldn't be conflated with overconfidence. It shouldn't be conflated with arrogance. Often these individuals are some of the most coachable and some of the most high growth mindset people I meet. But for whatever reason, they believe that their odds are different to the rest of their peer group. So this idea of high personal exceptionalism can be reasonably hard to evaluate. The great thing about EF is that before we invest.. So we invest after about 14 weeks. Before we invest, we've collected about 200 data points on every individual that has been through the program. Selection is important for us at the point where we're doing interviews, but actually we are able to select the entire way through the program before we invest. The other things that I would say that I'd pull out would be often the most interesting individuals in EF have these deeply obsessive personalities. Now it often doesn't matter what they're obsessed about, and often reasonably plastic in how they think about their obsession. As in, if you ask them in the past what they've been obsessive about, there could be four or five different things that seem really disconnected, but to be a successful founder, you need to be basically fully obsessed and fully absorbed by your startup. So having previous examples of that is a very, very strong indicator for us.A lot of founders or a lot of investors look for outliers. And I'd say that the same is true for us. We've tried, because we've got this large team of individuals, many of whom are involved in selection. We've had to think very hard about how do you actually codify what our outline looks like. So during our selection process, one of the things that we're constantly asking is how and where have you outperformed or done something differently that your peers wouldn't do? As one of the first questions is who's your peer group? How would you define your peer group? Who do you compare yourself to? And then by understanding that, and then getting them to articulate where they have outperformed, I think this is where the personal exceptions comes in as well, that self-belief. Some individuals find it very hard to articulate how they might have outperformed compared to their peers. You hear people respond and say things like, ""There's no way I could have built something that my peers couldn't have built. Surely we're all the same."" And then the good ones, like... ""Well there was this example, and there was this example, and there was this example."" And then the medium ones, they give you one example and then you've got to push the second and third, but they can get there. Something that we actually actively don't look for, and that I think are very, very hard to assess during a selection process is something like determination. Of course founders need to be determined, but how do you compare different examples of determination, some of which are self-driven. I climbed Mount Kilimanjaro. And some of which aren't, such as I escaped a war zone. These are previous examples we've had. How are you meant to compare those? We actually talk about drive to achieve rather than determination. How is this person demonstrated that they have pushed aggressively to make various achievements happen? They've had that innate drive to make things happen to themselves? Determination, when we used to ask, we used to have a question application form, show an example of a time you've been exceptionally determined, and it's just impossible to compare the different answers. Patrick: Once people are there, what are the next steps? So you've got someone in, let's say Singapore, they're with all these other people that are like them in terms of what they're trying to achieve. And one of the things you're trying to do is match people and you've got eight weeks to do it. So what does the program itself feel like to a participant? Alice: Honestly, EF feels very, very intense. One of the things that I love about EF is that often when people join, they say, ""Wow, I didn't think I'd find other people like me. And I definitely didn't think I'd find other people like me in such high volume."" So having the opportunity to interact with 50, 60, 70 other people who are as ambitious as you, who are as motivated, who are as unconventional as you like is a real magical moment for many of our customers that join us. EF can feel very emotional. Last year is the first time that most of the people who have joined us have failed, failed significantly. And yes, failure is baked in. So you join on day one. You join with, let's say, 50 other people. And by the end of that first week, you need to be in your first co-founding team. So within five days, you need to go through this sorting process where you're basically sorting, searching, evaluating, and choosing who you might want to co-found with. The reason we put such tight deadlines on this is because what we've found is counter as opposed to popular belief, which might say that time and space leads to better ideas or better co-founder relationships, what we've seen time and again is that the early stages of startup creation is more like the creation of a diamond. It's this intense moment of pressure that leads to something great. The reason why this works so well with team building and ideation is that you only know if it's a good team, you only know if it's a good idea, if you test it. If you don't test it, it's basically just conjecture. And it's very, very easy because it is such a human process, the co-founding process and the ideation process, to be honest... Because it's such a human process, it's very easy to get stuck in the talking loop, where you are talking, you're agreeing, you are having a wild time together, just enjoying each other's company. Now that's how you find a friend. That's not how you find a co-founder.And if a co-founder is going to be one of the most expensive decisions you ever make in your life, assuming you're successful, you give away half your company to this co-founder, there's literally nothing more expensive that you could do, you really need to treat it like a hiring process rather than like a friendship development process. I mean, one of our strong beliefs is that your best friend is not your best co-founder. I think a lot of the conventional wisdom is around, ""Okay, well, if you want to find a co-founder, find someone you've known for years, if not decades. You should have grown up together."" The reason we don't believe that is fully optimal... Yes, there are many examples of where that has worked beautifully, but the reason why we don't believe that is optimal is that how likely is it that your best friend is ready to go at the same time as you, has a complementary skill set, is interested in the same ideas as you. And I suppose one of the things we have found when we have worked with teams that have known each other for a long time is that there is often a huge amount of baggage that comes from having that preexisting relationship. That can often be quite hard to shake off. When we think about building these co-founding teams, what we're saying to the people that join us is this is your chance not just to find a co-founder. It's about finding the optimal co-founder, the right co-founder for you. And many people, when they join us, they have a preconceived idea about who their co-founders should be based on the press, based on watching the Social Network, based on whatever it may be. It's only beginning to test other people within the cohort that they understand who the right fit is for them. So typically people go through two or three co-founders in eight week period. They're typically working with them anywhere from 24 hours to four, five weeks. So it's a very, very fast iterative process. Patrick: When you think about what causes them to fail most commonly, I'm curious what that is. And I'm also curious how often it's not 50/50 at the end of it. Meaning CEO emerges that takes 70% of the equity and a CTO takes 30 or something like that, and whether or not EF guides that decision, or just lets the chips fall where they made between the founders. Alice: Well the equity question is reasonably simple. We recommend all teams split 50/50. Unless there is a real significant reason as to why it should be different, our push is always to see equity as forward looking, not backward looking. So even if you've come in with an idea you've spent four weeks, four months, whatever, working on, it's not sufficient to change the equity division. We often use the example of me and Matt. Matt is my co-founder. He started working on EF a month before I did. It would've been very easy for him at that time to say, ""Hey, I've actually made some progress. Why don't we do an unequal equity split?"" I probably would've accepted that. It's 10 years later. Would I accept that now? No. That would be a real thorn in our side. So co-founders are expensive, but one of the things that we push is that if you aren't willing to give somebody 50% of your company, are they the right co-founder? So if you're looking at a 30/70% split, for example, are you sure that person should be a co-founder? Maybe they should be a first employee. Do you think they are disposable? If you think they are, then okay, well maybe hire them as their first employee where you do have a different relationship. I mean, when we look at what makes teams fail, there's a very, very clear singular reason, although it's often not clear to the founders, and this is why the EF environment methodology is so important because most people joining EF, maybe they've experienced one co-founder in their life. We've seen thousands of people make hundreds of teams, and we have a very, very clear idea very quickly about which teams are going to work and which teams aren't. And the really clear indicator is productivity. We have an internal mantra, which is productivity is traction for teams.The teams that are making decisions on a daily basis, that are moving way faster than you would expect, who are developing and disproving hypotheses super, super fast, those are the teams that will succeed. The teams that won't succeed, and I was in one of our locations recently as the teams were all kicking off and sat down with this pair of co-founders who had been working together for a couple of days. And they were so excited about each other. Perfect on paper, perfect in real life, loved each other, thought it was going brilliantly. But then I asked them about the idea. And one of them told me about the idea and they got super excited. Really, really excited. And I was like, ""Oh, but how does the CTO fit into this? How does it fit with their background?"" The CTO was like, ""Well, I could try and manipulate my background so I fit in here, and..."" Say, ""Okay, well this doesn't sound like the best fit in terms of ideas. What other ideas do you have?"" The CTO told me his very exciting, brilliant idea. And the CEO looked slightly crestfallen. Thinking about productivity, if you are a highly productive team, you can get the idea that you want to work on, which is just your initial hunch, it's just the beginning point, and you can get to that in 24, 36 hours. It doesn't need to be a long, protracted process. If you are a team, like the one that I'm talking about, you feel like you're being productive, you feel like you're doing the right things, because you found somebody that you're really gel with. But ultimately if you're not able to make progress on the idea very, very fast, it's not going to work.",3194
58,Alice Bentinck - Building a Start-Up Machine,The Framework Behind Developing Great Ideas," Patrick: You bring me to the all important concept of the idea itself, and it maybe flies in the face of what one would normally think about from the outside looking in, which is somebody has an idea and they go pursue it. In this case, that's not what's happening necessarily, although I'm sure it does happen this way that someone comes to you with an idea and they try to find a co-founder to develop it with. Tell me everything you've learned about this process. How important is the actual idea itself or what the team is going to be working on? Because based on everything we've talked about so far, it sounds like talent and trust or chemistry between teams is almost more important than the idea itself. Is that true in your experience? Alice: Ideas are really important. I don't want to downplay the fundamental role the idea plays in whether the startup succeeds or not. But I suppose the bit of conventional wisdom that I would strongly, strongly challenge is that the way that a startup comes about is that somebody has an idea and they build a team around them. Yeah, you can build startups like that. That definitely works. But that's not what we've found to be optimal. What we found to be most exciting and to build the most interesting companies is where you see the idea as a product of the co-founding relationship. So what I mean by that is you bring two individuals who are open minded, but also incredibly clear about what they can bring to the table. And then you get them to ask each other the question of, ""How could we work together? Where do our backgrounds intersect? What do I know? What can I do? What skills do I have? What behaviors do I have? You tell me what you have as well, and let's see where they might intersect."" So the idea is the product of two people's backgrounds, experiences, and skills coming together. And the reason why I love this, why I find it so exciting is that whenever you sit by yourself and try and come up with an idea, you are constrained by the markets you know, by the skills that you have. It's very, very hard to imagine beyond that.As soon as you start interacting with someone else where you come in with the openness of mind to open up your background and skills to what they might be able to create, you're basically in this moment of combinatorial innovation, where the combination of what you two can create is way more powerful than what anyone individual can produce alone. And I think that's why people find EF so addictive when they first join, because they come in often thinking, ""Yeah, my ideas are really great. I'm just going to sell my idea. I hear what EF says, I'm just going to sell my idea. I'm pretty stuck on it. I think it's the right thing."" And then they come in and they very, very quickly back away from whatever idea they thought they were going to end up working on because they just didn't realize what was possible. Those interactions with a co-founder. We have this framework that we use called Edge, which is basically to find a co-founder and to develop an idea, you need to know where you have advantages. What are your personal competitive advantages? These are your edges. It could be in the technology. It could be in a market. It could be certain behaviors that you have. The more that you understand yourself, and the more that you can use that language to then communicate that to your potential co-founder, the faster you can then get to this point of combinatorial innovation. So this is definitely one of the things that I find most exciting about what we do and why at the core of EF what we're doing is creating companies that otherwise wouldn't exist. We're bringing together individuals that wouldn't otherwise meet each other, and they're then coming up with ideas that just couldn't have existed because they wouldn't have met each other. Patrick: Are there any other exercises that you enjoy most doing with the various cohorts, things like this concept of finding or delineating your edge? Is there anything that's really stood the test of time that you've done across a number of years or a number of cohorts during the actual eight week span that we haven't talked about? Alice: Well, I suppose we've talked about the people in the cohort, we've talked about methodology. I suppose the final bit is social norms. So those would basically be the three ingredients to making a cohort successful, where you turn these individuals, turning these strangers into companies. The social norms around EF are interesting, and basically regardless of where you're located, whether you're in Singapore or Paris or Toronto, there are a bunch of social norms that stand. In life it's hard to have difficult conversations with people. It's hard to say to somebody, ""I don't want to be with you."" It's hard to break up with a co-founder. What we've done with EF is basically, when every cohort joins us, we create new social norms and new culture that is EF specific. The primary thing that we focus on is how to have difficult conversations with your co-founder. And the reason we do this is because we want individuals to get into and out of teams as quickly as possible. So we want to get you into a team before you feel ready, and then we want to get you out of the team the moment that you begin to have doubts. So one of the things that we do is the first weeks of the program, we sit down and as a big group, as a cohort, and we teach them how to have difficult conversations with their co-founders.And then live they will sit in their pairs and they'll have difficult conversations with their co-founders. And then at the end, we say, ""Who's ready to break up?"" And a bunch of teams will put up their hands and they get a massive round applause. So it's beginning to show that actually the process of breaking up is a positive thing rather than a negative thing. And the speed that you do it should be celebrated. And there's a lot of lovely social norms that have been developed by the cohort that we now push to every cohort. So I can't remember which cohort it was a number of years ago that they broke up, one of the co-founders put on Slack, ""Hey, I just want to say why Patrick was so great. He was really good at this and was really interested in this. Didn't work out for us, but I highly recommend them."" And it covered in emojis and then everyone else started doing it. And it's just the lovely reinforcement of this is a social norm that is new and it's difficult, but it's the right thing to do. Because the opportunity cost of being in the wrong team with the wrong co-founder is so insanely high. Team building at EF is only eight weeks long, which feels like a reasonably long period of time, but actually when you're in, it's incredibly short. So for us making sure that velocity of team building, making sure that speed of entry and exit into a team as fast as possible, this social norm really supports that. Patrick: How does this look physically, and we don't have to go too far into what you did during COVID, because I think going forward, hopefully it'll be more normal like it was pre COVID again, but how does each city run? Is there a team that runs each city? What do they do during this period of the cohort? Is it in a specific building? What is the actual experience of it physically? Alice: So we have offices in all our locations. The offices are largely gathering spot for the cohort, particularly in the early weeks of the program where, because we want individuals to get into and out of teens as quickly as possible. There is a spot that if you aren't in a team for whatever reason, you can go and hang out there, meet other individuals. We are big, big believers in in person. We did EF remotely during COVID. Did actually work way better than we thought it would, but there was some impact on team building outcomes. But largely I would compare it to online dating in that with online dating you do your sort and your search online, but you do your testing in person. Be very rare, weird to commit to the marriage if you've only ever done online testing. I'm sure that happens, but very rarely.And the same is true with EF, that ultimately we don't really mind where the founders go and test their relationship, wherever they go and work, but we do want them to do that in person. The key role that the office plays is that we talk about having a liquid pool of founders. So any one point in time, there'll be a group of founders who aren't in a team, and actually the important role that the office plays is having a space where those founders can have those serendipitous interactions where they bump into each other, have the opportunity to talk about how their edges, how their backgrounds might intersect, and have the opportunity to form teams. I mean, EF is amazingly robust that even across cohorts, across locations, and even during COVID, we typically hit about 80% of people finishing the eight week period in a co-founding team.The other 20%, they leave at that point. But I think one of the nice things is that often they leave because they've just done eight weeks of going through this pretty intense process, and for some of them it's very clarifying. ""Actually I don't want to do this. Actually it's not the right time. I don't want to commit to someone right now."" And I think the great byproduct of the EF is that even if you don't find a co-founder, even if you don't end up building a startup, it is this intense life experience that changes the way you think about what you can do in your career and how startups might fit into that.",2136
59,Alice Bentinck - Building a Start-Up Machine,Investing Process and Mechanics," Patrick: So now we can progress a little bit towards the investment portion of what you do. Ultimately I think EF is so interesting as a business because much like accelerators, let's say, in the US that actually start operating at a later stage when there's already a founder and a company. So you're as early as you can possibly be. But you end up owning significant equity stakes in businesses that are created as a result of your platform. And I think everyone involved with EF would ultimately agree that if there's enormous enterprise value, it's going to come from several or many of the companies becoming huge, successful, publicly traded or acquired companies, something like that. You said earlier that you invest sometimes in up to half of them, have equity stakes as a natural byproduct of the platform, and that you gathered 200 data points along the way. So what are you doing, now shifting from the connecting piece of EF to the investing piece, what are you doing as the cohorts unfold to collect that data, or the categories of that data, and then how do you ultimately make those investment decisions at the end as to whether or not EF's going to participate in the company? Alice: We've always seen EF as a machine we're building rather than a fund. The reason why these data points are so important is, A, enables us to make better investment decisions. But B, it also means that no single individual at EF is making the investment decision. We believe in the power of the machine. We want to make the EF machine, the EF product as strong as possible, rather than relying on me or Matt or any one of... We do have GPs because of the funds that we manage, but the GP decision, the general partner decision is sign off rather than deciding factor. So we start collecting data about the individuals we work with from the point where they first apply. And often actually before that. We often have reasonably long term relationships with the individuals that we work with. I remember one guy who's now running one of the biggest companies in our portfolio, who I spent two years having coffee with him, trying to convince him that actually the internal entrepreneurship thing that he'd been offered in his company wasn't the best route. He should come and join EF. So actually by the time he applied, I knew him really well, and I knew what his strengths were and where his weaknesses might be. So we collected much data points during the selection process, and then that feeds into this first product, which we called Form, and that's where the teams are built. Every week the individuals are checking in with someone from our team and the companies are checking in with someone from our team as well. Our venture partners who are all external entrepreneurs who do the advisory work at EF. So by the time that they reach our investment committee, which is 14 weeks after the program starts... So some startups might be as young as six weeks, the oldest will be 14 weeks old. We're going in with a huge amount of information about the individuals and their backgrounds, but also how they performed during the program. How productive were they? How stable are their teams?And we're pretty transparent with our customer about this is what we do because we feel we have a duty of care to our customer as much as to our investors and LPs that if we invest in you, we're going to want you to keep running that company. So if we don't think that it is the right co-founding team. If we think there are cracks in that co-founding team, or if we think you're wasting your time on a market or area that doesn't make sense, it's actually in your interest for us to have all of that data so that we can say no investment committee, and the opportunity cost is being trapped in the wrong startup is really high, so come back and do EF again. But I think what I love is that by the time we do investment committee, which we have an investment committee process, each startup meets with three individuals for half an hour, ask a bunch of questions, really what we are doing is signing off what we've learned about these individuals during that 14 week process, rather than coming up with a independent investment decision. I do not envy funds that have to make a decision based on one or two interactions with a founder they've only just met. It terrifies me. We're very lucky that we are investing in individuals that we have a deep relationship with. Patrick: Now, once that happens, how do these companies mature from there? I know that one of your key focuses, you were just all over the US meeting with tons of US based investors. What kinds of investors tend to fund the next stage of these businesses, because they're in cities that aren't Silicon Valley or anywhere in the US. I don't know what the exact percentage is, but some huge percentage of early stage or seed stage venture dollars are probably US based. What is the linkage there? What are your ambitions there? And how much does it matter who funds the next... Based on the outcomes that you've observed, who funds the earliest stages after they graduate from EF? Alice: Typically companies leave us three months after our investment committee. So the startups are anywhere between three and six months old. And at that point they're looking to raise their seed rounds. We're lucky that we have some great relationships with the VCs in our local ecosystems. But one of the things that we are keen to do is to support our companies to tap into US capital. So if you look at the time it takes to raise a seed round in Singapore, it wouldn't be unusual for it to take six to nine months to actually close the term sheet and get money in the bank. Now that's a massive cost for founders, a massive cost in having your CEO spending the majority of their time for six to nine months just trying to close funding round. One of the things that I've been spending a bunch of my time on, is I spent the last couple of months in San Francisco meeting with early stage investors to try and understand what does it take to support more US based and Bay Area investors to find and see and get access to these incredible deals that may not be based right under their nose. The world has changed during COVID. I think this move to you, do your Zoom and then you get in the room has changed things so that founders who aren't based in the Valley aren't disadvantaged in the same way that they used to be. And I was amazed at the openness to international investing and how many of the investors... I spoke to about 70 pre-seed investors. Pre-seed and seed investors, and how many of them had done deals in Europe, Asia, Africa, Latin America in the last couple of years.Now, I think that has been largely driven by the crazy evaluations they were seeing locally, and maybe that will temper a little bit going forward. But I think there has been a realization that the quality of talent outside of the US building companies is fantastic. And there's actually a real advantage to investing in companies where they are based locally, largely a talent advantage. The talent war in the US and Bay Area is so vicious, both in terms of salaries and retention, and that problem is you're at a far greater advantage if you stay in London or stay in Berlin or stay wherever your local network is. My talent is much cheaper and much stickier. So I think there's a real benefit to both US investors and to our startups to say, ""Hey, US investors, if you want your capital to go further, and if you want to access startups that are much more reasonable valuation, start looking outside of the typical startup ecosystems.""And for our startups, having that link in the early days to the US, we've seen it does great things for their series A, having a local US fund that can provide signal for the series A. But also in terms of giving them access to the Silicon Valley mindset. The Silicon Valley mindset is unbelievably powerful. I think it's one of the things that YC has done so well where they very much basically transplant a Silicon Valley mindset into all these international companies that come and join YC. And really we want to do something very similar, but at a much, much earlier stage. So for investors listening to this, I would encourage them to think about what would it take for them to start investing internationally London gets a lot of noise. Toronto is a very well known ecosystem. But places like Paris, the talent is unbelievable. The talent there is so deep, so rich, but still a relatively untapped ecosystem. Same with somewhere like Singapore, where you really do get the best of Southeast Asia, all coming to one country and city state, and there's relatively poor competition there in terms of early stage investors. There's masses and masses of opportunity. We're very excited about making this happen. We think it would be much better for our customer, much better for their long term prospects, but also there's a big opportunity there for US based investors.",1902
60,Alice Bentinck - Building a Start-Up Machine,Why EF is Unique," Patrick: My next question maybe has a bunch of sub components to it, which is why aren't there 10 EFs? It strikes me as very odd, if you just look at it from the perspective, let's say, of a California based early stage investor, that a big input into their success is finding great companies, getting in at a good price, and then watching them grow, and we all know it's happened to US based prices. I'm curious what the average... Maybe discount is the wrong word, but that's what it is. For the same stage, what average price or valuation an investor is paying, let's say at seed for a company... And I'm even curious between, say, London and Paris, or you pick the two countries. It's something different that not everyone is less picked over at a cheaper price. It just strikes me as odd that you're the one EF. There aren't one of these for every single city. Why aren't there more EFs out there, and what am I missing in that? What seems like an obvious opportunity set expansion for US investors? Alice: To answer your question about valuations. So AngelList has an amazing data set on valuations. I think it was showing that 2021, 2022, a 75th percentile startup would be raising pre-seed, post-money valuation at something like $15 million. If you look at most EF locations, that'd be more like $5 million. For seed in the US, AngelList is saying it jumps to something like 30 to $40 million. In most of the EF locations, it'd be more like 10 to 15 million at seed, and those would still be considered very good valuations. Why don't more investors do this? Well for a long time, this seems a very, very counterintuitive model. Taking individuals, building teams from scratch, taking people without firm ideas, evaluating individuals on their behaviors rather than on their idea. All of this stuff was seemed to be very counterintuitive. I think now a lot of this is becoming more status quo and we are seeing lots and lots of investors rushed to pre-seed as a way of getting around the crazy seed prices.We're not even pre-seed. We are one stage before that. To do a pre-seed the other company has to invest and do one stage before that. And that one stage has been really difficult bit. It is operationally incredibly intense. It's interesting to see a couple of companies now trying replicate the EF model, that they reliably struggle with is you can find a talent, even have the capital, but how do you actually get them into teams? And there's so much... We have a very strong methodology. There's a lot of nuance in that methodology. There's a lot that you have to get right, to create a dynamic where strangers turn into co-founders. And it seems to be something that others have really, really struggled to replicate. I think you also have to be in company building mode rather than AUM building mode. Yeah, a VC model does work very well for the kinda thing that we're doing, and we've used a VC model for about seven years now, coming out of that, and going to a company balance sheet model again.But if you approach something like EF where you are looking to try and optimize your AUM, again, it doesn't make sense to deploy so little capital so early where it's high risk, you need to have a pretty significant fee burden to pay for all the operational costs. If you can, you might as well try and move upmarket and take the seed or series A stage. So where we see barriers, I suppose, is that EF is a company that is creating a supply of startups that wouldn't exist otherwise, and as a company, we are willing to upfront invest the operational capital and to take on the operational complexity to make that happen. And I think if you are trying to get into this as a VC, there's a bunch of operational cap there you just don't want to deal with. Patrick: Yeah. 35,000 applicants, just that stat alone sounds daunting and brutal. Maybe talk a little bit.... Now's a good time to talk about this conversion that you've gone through. And again, just in the spirit of full disclosure, I and my firm Positive Sum are investors now in EF's holding company structure or corporate balance sheet driven structure, which we're really excited about, but maybe talk about the motivations for the change, what it means, what are you changing from and what are you changing to, and why you did it in the first place? Alice: We've just raised 150 million onto the balance sheet rather than into a fund. We're lucky that that round was done by incredible investors and founders like yourself, the Collison brothers, the founders of Stripe came into that. Charlie Songhurst, who I know has been on Invest Like the Best as well. Matt Mullenweg, founder of WordPress. Taavet Hinrikus, the founder of TransferWise, Sarah Friar, the founder of Nextdoor. Really it's the coming together of some of the world's best founders to support the next generation. And the reason we made this shift and why we're so excited about it is, first of all, our investors understand that what we're trying to build is a long term talent institution. You do that with a product, and as anyone who's listening who is a founder knows, or who's been in an operational role, products change. They need to be flexible. They need to adapt to different market conditions, to different customer expectations. And a fund structure is pretty rigid.When you raise a fund, you are three, four years ahead committing to what your operational expenses will be. We were committing in our previous fund to where we did invest the capital in terms of locations. It's a pretty rigid structure. One of the things we're really excited about is we want to make EF the best place in the world to find your co-founder. Every stage of your founding career. The new structure means that we have a lot more fungibility with the capital that we have. We can decide whether we put a pound or a dollar into an investment, or into growing EF, changing our product suite, experimenting with new initiatives. So I think we've been very, very lucky to have some amazing LPs that have taken a big risk on a new model over the last seven years. But as I say, we're very excited with this new model where we can really behave like the company that we are rather than the VC firm and use that capital to truly delight the next generation of entrepreneurs through expanding, developing, and honing the model that we have created. Patrick: One of my favorite things talking to you specifically is this love of product that you have, and I feel like every time we talk, it always comes back to interesting new ideas or recent learnings of things that you've tried. One that comes to mind is that you came up with this notion of inviting EF alumni back. Those that weren't currently in a company, to a second go of it, if you will. I can't remember what it was called. And the success rate there was quite high. So you had another way to leverage the platform that you've built and the network that keeps growing and expanding to produce yet more companies. So just walk me through what your product hat feels like to wear. Why are you so interested in product? What are some of the ideas that you're playing with right now? Alice: One of the things I love is this feels like something that can't be a product. Turning strangers into co-founders. How can you create a structure that reliably does that? I have to say for the first three years of EF it really wasn't clear that we could do that. It took us a while. It took quite a while to hone that. When I think about the best startups in the world create a behavior explosion, they create a new kind of behavior that didn't exist before. And then you just see the platform, the product, the startup enables an explosion behavior that didn't exist. I think EF can do that for how startups are created. And the analogy I would use is if you look at something like online dating Match.com came out in 1995, still around today. But 1995 online dating was very different from 2022 online dating. 1995 online dating was for individuals who maybe seemed to be a bit weirder. It was definitely something that was socially frowned upon. It seen as a suboptimal way to find somebody to spend the rest of your life with. That was what you were looking for. 2022, it's become the default way to find a partner. It's become the optimal way. Why would you waste your time sitting in a bar, waiting for somebody to come hit on you or hitting on somebody in a bar when you don't even know if they're available? It feels like the most crazy use of time. I strongly believe that we will see the same shift happen with co-founders. Right now, finding your co-founder through a program like Entrepreneur First. It's a bit weird. Yeah, people think it's strange. What, you couldn't find your own co-founder? You couldn't find somebody.I think what is really powerful is over the next 10 years, however long it takes this shift to happen, I believe we can get to the point where your best friend turns around to you and says, ""Hey, we should co-found a company together."" And you go, ""Actually, I think I'm going to join EF because I really want to find the right co-founder for me, and I want to have the opportunity to experiment with different people, because I believe that's the optimal way to find a co-founder, not the alternative way to find a co-founder."" If EF can be the creator and owner of this new behavior explosion, where more people can find the right co-founder for them, that enables them to get to the best possible outcome, that enables more people to become co-founders because they finally have that option. What happens if you don't know somebody you've been brought up with since birth who can be your co-founder who's ready to go right now and interested in the same ideas? It basically means you're out of the market being a founder. So if EF can be the owner of this behavior explosion, we can basically own that pre-seed talent investor market. I think that's super, super exciting. Now I think there's a bunch of different products that you could provide to people, so that at the moment we are focusing on early career, first time founders, but actually finding a co-founder is something that you experience throughout your co-founding journey. I very much think that for most people who take up the founding journey, they see it as a career path. It's not that I do one company, it's this is my first company, and this is my second company. And I'm building on... There's a great book by Ali Tamaseb called Super Founders, which basically looks at what are the indicators that somebody might end up being a billion dollar founder, and one of them is that they've had a reasonable success in the past. And we want to be part of our customers' founding journey the first time round, the second time round, the third time round.So as you were saying, we're building a bunch of products and testing a bunch of products this year to enable people to find their co-founders in different ways. So using the EF methodology selection process frameworks that we know work and we know succeed, but in different formats. You might not want to do a 14 week program if you've already founded a company once. A lot of the content might be irrelevant to you. So as you were mentioning, we're doing this program called Reform, it's test at the moment, it's for our alumni to meet each other and experiment with co-founding teams. We've got some great teams coming out of it. We've got one called Metavoice that was actually two individuals from one of our previous programs that joined up with an alum who left EF six years ago, five years ago, something like that. It's really cool product where they are building real time on chain voice NFTs. So if you're pseudonymous, for example, you can participate on every part of the internet, apart from vocally, because you would be displaying what your voice was, and you can generate a voice or they have a product that generates a real time depiction of your voice in whatever you choose your voice to be, and that is an NFT attached to you, which is pretty cool. That company wouldn't have existed otherwise. So yeah, I'm very excited about different ways to help create and generate companies that wouldn't exist otherwise, largely through the medium of helping people find the right co-founder for them.",2754
61,Alice Bentinck - Building a Start-Up Machine,Great Locations to Build Companies," Patrick: We started getting into it a talking about of getting into it a little bit earlier, talking about the preference for cities that have strong educational ties or great university systems. What cities do you have your eye on that EF is not a participant in today, and what are the criteria by which you stack rank those cities beyond just having top universities there? Alice: One of the questions for us is what is the right number of EFs to have? What is the right number of EF locations to have? We want EF to be accessible to anyone who could be a globally important world class founder, and there's different ways you can do that. You can do that through relocation, and we've had some great success relocating individuals from a region to one of our hubs. But one of the things we're looking at the moment is what are the reasons where we don't necessarily have an easily accessible EF hub? I think there's still more that we can do in Asia. It was interesting being out in the US for a couple of months and just hearing how the view of Latin America has changed so much in the last couple of years. Latin America seemed to be the location that everyone was suddenly putting capital into, whether it be in Colombia or Brazil or Argentina. So I think there's something interesting happening there. And then it's interesting to see more noise around Africa, whether it be in Nairobi, Cape Town, or a variety of different places.When we think about growing EF there are various ways that we can think about doing that. One is we can grow geographically, but it could be that we also just grow existing sites and think about growing our product suite. So how do we offer different products to individuals at different stages of their career that enable EF to grow, enable us to catch more value from our customers without actually opening new sites. As a operating company, without a software product, we have to think very carefully about how we scale. It can be very easy to scale very fast, but actually so much of EF is about effectively delivering playbooks, about understanding the nuance in delivering those playbooks, and that is pretty hard to scale. It's not an easy model to scale. But one of the things that we are looking at is we've got some shorter form versions of EF that we can use to test new locations. So we're pretty excited about rolling them out over the next year or so, and using that as a way to understand where we should be going. Patrick: If you could snap your fingers and have the perfect piece of software built to capture or take over some part of the EF process that exists today that's not in software, what would it be? Alice: One of the most powerful thing that we did in the last couple of years is building an internal data and insights team. So we actually have pretty good tooling across most of the company. The really hard bit is the human bit, and I just don't know how much you can digitize that. So we've done a bunch of experiments in the past, and we have a bunch of automations that nudge people into teams. One of the most important things in the team building is having clarity about who is and who isn't in teams. We have a really simple Slack automation that basically lets everyone know when a team gets together, when a team breaks up. That stuff is really useful.But actually a lot of the labor intense work that we do is... EF is a very emotional people process. And we did actually do an experiment once a couple years ago, where we tried to strip out as much that as possible. And it didn't really work. There's only so much that you can capture from digitally inputted information. Often to really understand and assess how a co-founding team is doing, you do need to speak to them in person, or at least on Zoom. We did actually have a very long conversation at one point, Matt, my co-founder and I, about should EF be a software business, or should it be a people business? Software can be our infrastructure, it can be our backbone, but it can't be the product. Patrick: If you think back to your and Matt's now fairly long co-founding relationship, it's probably pretty important that you're encouraging others to do this and that you've done it yourself. What has been the key, and I'm curious what stands out about the earliest days. He told me to ask you about your first office and where you got the furniture and ask you about carriage driving and some other fun things. What have been the keys to your relationship with Matt over the years, lessons that you think are portable to other co-founding teams? Alice: I mean, I feel very lucky. Matt and I have been co-founders now for 10 years and had a pretty harmonious decade together. I think if anything, because EF is such an unusual business, the fact that we have two very chunky parts of business, one which is very operationally complex, which I run, and one which is the investment side of the business, which Matt runs, there is so much to do within the company, and it's very easy for us to have clear ownership. I think that has made it pretty easy to have two highly ambitious, reasonably A type personalities working together for such a long time. I mean the early days of EF were such a scrappy, intense time. I think we were both coming out of... We met at McKinsey. We met at our first day of working there. And when we left, I think took us a little bit of time to shake the shackles being a consultant.We spent a lot of the early days of EF making PowerPoints. Don't know if anyone ever read those PowerPoints or whatever happened to those. But then the biggest challenge we had in the early days is for three years no one would fund us. So for three years we were not for profit, and registered not for profit. We actually tried to incorporate as a charity, but Matt and I had to do everything, and fitting out our first office was haggling to try and get a free space that was condemned that was about to be knocked down. The furniture we got from another building that was condemned. And we managed to convince Zipvan basically to give us some free memberships that we'd get a free van to pick up the free furniture. And as we were shipping that furniture from old office to this new place, we managed end up on the scene of... Do you know who Robbie Williams is? He's a massive pop star in the UK. Patrick: Yeah, sure. Alice: We managed to end up on the scene of his music video, where we managed to drive right onto the set, and I was driving. I'm not a very confident driver. Don't love it. We just showed up, having about 20 people, shouting and screaming at us, with Robbie Williams sat and said... What is this? Matt and I are very clear on a couple of things. One is that we talk about the idea being a product of the co-founders. EF is a product of us. Neither of us have software backgrounds. EF is not a software company. And there is a cost to that. I'm sure if we'd spent 10 years building a different company, possibly with different people, maybe we would've created far more value. And we say this very openly to the people coming through EF, because there was like... EF always says, ""Find somebody with complementary skills,"" and then you and Matt are very similar. And we are, but it has dictated the company that we could produce.What I still feel very lucky about is that 10 years in our mission is as enduring and as exciting to me. I can't imagine doing anything else in my life that would be more exciting than helping the next generation of entrepreneurs to come through and meet their level of ambition, whatever that might be, meet their potential. The product that we're selling is genuinely life changing. When we look at the outcomes of our alumni and what they've achieved and gone on to do and what they thought they were going to do when they... In the beginning and early stages of thinking about applying to EF is genuinely transform their lives. And I think I'd find it very hard to now build another startup that didn't have that same monumental impact on the customer. And I think Matt and I are just very aligned on our addiction for that and love for that. Patrick: I was thinking recently about the amazing conditions in the US specifically that have allowed for so much company building, and when you really dig into them, things like property law, or rule of law, consistent standards, so much of it is predictability, like lack of major uncertainty of the environment in which you're going to build the business and reliable things that you can count on that are outside your business, like property rights or something. What do you think are the most important natural international impediments to company creation and growth? So if EF wants to effectively foster more great enduring company building all around the world, what are the impediments that maybe you don't directly control? You're working very hard on the things you can control and that's great. But what are the things beyond what you can control that keep you up at night or you think serve as roadblocks to the best case outcome here? Alice: Very simply the biggest competitor that EF has is the status quo. The status quo is so strong. Status quo of how people spend their lives, what they expect from their careers, how they think about what they want to achieve with their lives is very, very strong. What Silicon Valley has done so brilliantly is because the culture there is so homogenous and so defined, if you transplant an individual there, you can very quickly change their perspective on what the status quo of their life is going to be. It's really hard to do that in these multi-industry cities that we're in, where actually most people aren't starting startups. Most people are waiting for their bonus. Most people are waiting for that promotion to get to partner in a consultant firm or a bank or whatever it may be. So when we look at who rejects EF's offer, the most common reason to reject is to stay on the status quo.Now, what you could say is, ""Well, we didn't want those people anyway. They weren't any good. If they didn't want to be a founder, then they're not for us."" But I think that is too closed a mindset. It undervalues how strong the status quo is. If you think about the mindset shift that somebody has to go through, they spend the first 25 years of their life being told that life will look one way and then suddenly ES comes in and it's like, ""Hey, no, your job doesn't matter. Sucks being an employee. You want to have real impact in the world, actually you need to do this other thing."" That's a very hard mindset shift for somebody to go through very quickly. Now we are seeing it change. If you look at somewhere like London, becoming a founder's becoming more of a aspirational, default aspiration career path. But most people are still default employed, and that is still our biggest challenge. Patrick: Well, obviously as an investor, I'm incredibly interested in what you're doing, but even if I wasn't, I'm just always been so fascinated talking both to you and Matt about what you've built so far, the clear success that it's shown by any measure. Companies created, investment returns in those companies and so on. And I'm really excited for what it might mean for the world in the future. I just think it's such a neat concept that is so nuanced, as you've described, when others have tried and failed, where they've failed as often in the area of nuance it's been really fun spending time today getting to know EF in a little bit more detail than when I talked to Matt about it. I really appreciate your time. I ask everybody the same traditional closing question. What is the kindest thing that anyone's ever done for you? Alice: One of my first managers at McKinsey... I definitely had huge imposter syndrome when I first joined and McKinsey is very good at throwing very young graduates into situations they're definitely not qualified to do. We would be walking into meetings and she would just say, ""Cool, you do this one."" And it would absolutely terrify me, and then afterwards, I remember saying to her, ""It would be really great if you could just give me some time to prepare."" And she was like, ""No, the beauty of this is that you need to do it on the fly."" And it felt horrible at the time. It was really uncomfortable. But I will forever be grateful to her because I think that ability to conquer imposter syndrome, think on your feet, form on your feet has been a vital skill for the rest of my career. A shout out all the managers out there who really genuinely try and push the people that work for them to greatness. Patrick: I think I'm going to steal that method. Love it. Very unique answer. Never had that specific one before. Alice, thanks so much for your time. Alice: A real pleasure. Thanks for having me.This site uses cookies to improve your browsing experience.

62,Jess Lee - Designing Investment Products,Introduction," Patrick: My guest today is Jess Lee. Jess is a partner at Sequoia Capital, as well as their Chief Product Officer. Before becoming an investor, Jess co-founded fashion app Polyvore, and was an early Product Manager for Google Maps. Most recently, she co-founded All Raise, a nonprofit that is changing the gender balance in tech. Our discussion ranges from Burning Man, to Marvel, to Sequoia's mobile app. And I hope that Jess's passion for delighting users rubs off on you. Please enjoy my conversation with Jess Lee.",127
63,Jess Lee - Designing Investment Products,Investing With a Product Mindset," Patrick: Jess, I was thinking about an interesting place to begin our discussion today and I tried to respect what's unique about you, which is this really interesting vent diagram of product building and product thinking and investing. And so I thought maybe we'd begin right there at the intersection of those two things, specifically around products that investing firms offer. So, if you ask most people, especially at early stage private markets where Sequoia focuses, primarily when it makes its first investments, they would say that the product is capital. You're giving money to companies, you get a great team or a board member or whatever in exchange, and it's a very simple product and that most investment firms work that way. Why do you think more investment firms, especially ones that make direct investing where capital is part of the product, don't have more of a product mindset like actual products like the ones that they're backing themselves when they're outlaying capital? Jess: That is a great question and one that I found myself wondering as a founder. I met so many VCs when we were pitching my company Polyvore, and it felt like a lot of the firms just offered money. And then, if you were lucky, you got capital plus a really great board member. And I just found myself thinking, ""Oh my God, I do so much as a founder. But there's so many things I don't know about company building. I wish there was something else, something more, out there."" And so after my founder journey and I came to Sequoia, I found myself thinking about that a lot. I do think there's a way to apply the product mindset to venture capital and to investing. And, if you think about Sequoia's customers, our customers are the founders. And, if we want to be great, we need to be customer obsessed, just like our greatest founders are customer obsessed. And then you need to delight your customers. You need to be innovating. You need to be doing things differently. You have to have the better, unique, compelling value prop. And so we think about that a lot.And actually, in addition to being an investor, I spend about 70% of my time investing, I'm also our Chief Product Officer. So, that's literally my job, is to be customer-obsessed. For a founder, I often think, ""What could we offer?"" There's some parts of the business, of your company, where you are really innovating. You're inventing new technologies, you're building products that customers never seen before, new UI patterns. And then there's a bunch of things that you are doing that other founders have already done before, where you do not need to completely reinvent the wheel, say comp philosophy, or the best way to do a ladder for your career levels or how to run a really good one on one, how to have an exec team, your hiring process for engineering. You're always innovating at the edges of some of those things, but there's some things I just wish someone had told me from the early days. So, those are some of the things we think about at Sequoia, and try to figure out how do we turn that into a product for the founders. Patrick: How do you think about tackling just one of those? You could choose the example, it could be the one-on-one meeting or something. What would a productized version of ""We're going to help you get better at one-on-one meetings"" look like? With the consideration that a great board member, I think, Roelof talked about this when he and I did an episode together, is really about those goals in the crucible moments, the big strategic, hard, hairy problems. Running great one-on-one meetings probably is not what a lot of the best investors are spending their time coaching their founders on. Maybe some are. When I think of product, I think of something scalable and someone's time isn't scalable. So, when you start to think about the atomic unit here, and this isn't just in venture, it could apply in any sort of equity and it could apply in any kind of investing, because there's always counterparties. How do you think about that? What do you go do? What is step one to say, ""Okay. There should be something better here. There isn't. Let's do something about it""? Jess: We try to think about a portfolio of products that work. There's some things that are evergreen, like core foundational company building concepts, founder led sales, how to do it well, how to write a great culture deck. All those things are really important to get right from the early days. And, for that, we have programs like Arc, which is our take on an accelerator, but it's eight weeks of programming curriculum. You get a lecture created by Sequoia, taught by a Sequoia partner that boils that concept down into a simple framework. And then, you get a talk by someone from the field who has applied that and can tell you the real example of how they applied it at their company, as an exec or as a founder. And that's eight weeks. Actually, this week, we're running the European cohort, the first class of this. They're in Stockholm right now, went to visit Klarna to see, ""Here's an example of greatness. This is what a great company looks like."" How far they've come talking with the founders and the exec team.There's that. That's scaling the level of ambition, the core concepts. And then, there's something as tactical as, ""Should I give out the title 'Head of' or 'VP' for my first exec?"" And that is an article you can find inside of Ampersand, which is our founder mobile app and portal, and you can look up all kinds of very tactical questions. And then there are things that are constantly evolving, like the best growth marketing tactic right now. That's always going to be changing as the platforms shift, whether you're growth hacking TikTok or Instagram, tactics are going up and down. So, for there, we try to connect you with community, who are the right people you need to know in the network. And so Ampersand also has a DM function, a directory of all the people in the community so you could reach out and actually find that expertise. Or we set up a lot of events, you can just decide to attend any one of the events and talk to various experts or ask questions. Patrick: When you think about something like Ampersand, I haven't personally seen so I'm guessing at what it feels and looks like, how do you measure success? So, if that's a product sponsored by you and it's obviously different than probably a direct revenue generating product, how do you think about judging yourselves as to whether or not you're doing a good job? Is it just usage and engagement? How do you decide new features to have? Usually the arbiter is commercial success and this is a little bit removed from that. So, how do you decide whether or not you've done a good job? Jess: Just like any good product team, we look at the metrics. So we track DAU/MAU on a regular basis, we look at what percent of posts get replied, we look at the DM activity. We obviously don't read the DMS, but just knowing, are people talking to each other? Are people reading the new content? So, we look pretty carefully on a daily basis in our Slack channel. It posts, ""Here are the metrics for the Ampersand app."" Patrick: I'm a big believer that, like everything, the Arc is towards more competition that providers of capital are going to... The winners are going to do more valuable things for their partners. Do you get the sense that this is a driving reason that Sequoia might win deals, or see more deals, or some input into the funnel of great investing that this drives it relative to, say, the obvious Sequoia brand name being arguably the best in the business? How much do you think it drives outcomes in investing versus drives outcomes in supporting companies? Jess: I think they're all interconnected. I think a lot of the reason that people choose to work with Sequoia, and Sequoia is not for everyone, is a lot of us are former operators, we don't take very many board seats, each investor does one, two, maybe three investments per year. And we try to work really hard for our founders. And it's not just the board member, but it's the firm, it's the product, it's all of it. And so, we are maybe more deeply involved. And so, the better we are at helping you, and that could be through the board member, through Roelof sharing an anecdote from his time as CFO at PayPal or Alfred talking about what it was like to compete with Amazon at Zappos and how they outsmarted or out-innovated. And so, sometimes it's that. And sometimes it's that little piece of advice that you got in an article that you read because you had the library of articles at your fingertips. Or sometimes it's actually just connecting you, like maybe you came to our founder event Base Camp, or heard a great piece of advice on stage from Elon Musk. It's all interconnected. The better the firm is at helping founders, the more we become a magnet for other great founders of the next generation. Patrick: How has your work as the CPO of Sequoia changed or driven your investing views or investing behavior as an investor at Sequoia? Jess: The part of the product role I hadn't talked about is the investors are also our customers. So we have a data science platform that we use to help us with all parts of our job. And, if you think about the investing job, it's sourcing, picking, winning, and company building. And we talked a little bit about the company building side, but we also help on the rest of that. So, we, on a nightly basis, are pulling signals from all over the place to try to figure out what companies are inflecting, automated due diligence, comparison across to try to figure out who is the emerging category leader. That helps across all parts of the business. I can maybe share some examples. On the sourcing front, one of our partners, Bogomil, led an investment in a company called Infracost. Infracost has an open source component. And so we were able to see in GitHub that company was inflecting. And so, Bogomil was able to reach out maybe one month sooner, maybe before they were raising, and was able to establish that relationship. And we look at all different kinds of signals.On the picking side, we have a lot of benchmarks at this point on how well different companies are doing. So, for Sunday, we were able to see that their retention rate as a D2C subscription product was really best in class. And so that gave us a lot of confidence, that gave Stephanie this confidence to like, ""Okay, I feel pretty good about this investment."" Similarly, with Gong, we were looking at their reviews and ratings data across them versus competitors. And we got the sense that they were the emerging category leader and we invested with them when it wasn't entirely clear. On winning, the founders like knowing we have this data and can use it to help them. So, when I was working with Ironclad, I shared some of the data science analysis that we've done. And, to this date, I still share the NPS data, the ratings review data that we have to help the product team and to help the CEO.",2543
64,Jess Lee - Designing Investment Products,Building Community and Connection," Patrick: Obviously, I'm going to ask about a word here that has become maybe even eye rolley, it gets used so much and that's 'community.' It's a word that I know has been really important across your career as a founder, having built a business in this space, but also some of these things you've already described, Ampersand, the application that connects people, Base Camp, the event that connects people. There's lots of ways, obviously, that Sequoia is famous for doing this. And community is something that feels like it's become aspirational for everybody. Everyone wants to have a community that they started or something. And we also know, at a base level, it is incredibly powerful. Otherwise, why would we care? Maybe you could give us a masterclass on how to think about the idea of community and what it means to business. Local community is one thing, your neighborhood, your school, your whatever. Why has this become such a hot issue for seemingly everyone in the business community? You mentioned open source, that's one area where it does seem to really work and thrive. A community around a project can be a key way of evaluating that project. But it seems like everyone wants one of these, everyone wants to build a community business. Give us your take on everything you've learned as a builder in this space. Jess: I think the reason community's so relevant for business is that it's the ultimate growth engine. You're always worried about your CAC and how expensive it's to run an enterprise sales team, how difficult it is to acquire paid customers on Facebook or Instagram. And, if you have a community, which basically means a group of customers who love your products so much that they're willing to talk to their peers about it, that is free word of mouth marketing, that is zero CAC. And so, I think the best companies, in both consumer and enterprise, know that and really cultivate that obsessed, loyal group of community members. And those customers are loyal to the brand, they give you feedback when they don't like what you're doing, they're your ear to the ground, they're your greatest advocates. It's really, I think, a secret weapon. And something we did really, really well in my company at Polyvore was, despite not being the most well known or biggest, community side, in a space like consumer where there's very little longevity, brands go in and out of favor so quickly, we had a very loyal community. And I remember, maybe it was 12 years after we started, our acquirer's acquirer shut down Polyvore. And my Instagram, my DMs, I even got snail mail from community members who were really upset. For something to have survived 13 years and for people to be that mad about it going away, it just made me realize we weren't the biggest in the world, but we had some real loyalty. People were really mad about that, and what they're mad about was not just the functionality got taken away. It was that their friends got taken away and their way to access their friends. So that's the other big part of community. It's not just loyalty to the company. It's loyalty to each other and this sense of belonging. And so I think that's why it matters from a business perspective. Most people think about it from perhaps the consumer side of things. I work with The Wing and with Maven and with Otter, and those are communities of women, and women tend to be maybe more community oriented, but it also applies to the enterprise.I work with a company called Ironclad, which is a digital contracting platform, and the main customer are legal teams. And if you think about legal teams, lawyers are maybe not the highest on the totem pole inside of an organization. They're not the biggest buyers with the biggest budgets. People are often complaining about the lawyers saying, ""Hey, you guys are slowing down our sales contract. Why do we have to put all this protection?"" And, ""Why can't I just sign this deal?"" And so the lawyers are doing this really important job, but they don't have a lot of budget. They're not the most loved. And that underserved user, that is a really big opportunity to surprise and delight with a great product, grow loyalty and have that group, which is very small, all talk to each other. And that's what Ironclad did. Jason is a former lawyer. So we had a lot of affinity and deep understanding. He actually created the open source seed docs while he was a lawyer, that pretty much all the founders use now. And he realized there's a lot that could be done in contracting if you use the product. And so he created Ironclad and he began with just dinners, just helping the legal community hang out, share their issues, maybe even commiserate a little from being beaten up by the sales team so much. And that grew and grew and grew and fast forward today, he has a Chief Community Officer. That's not a title that you see much in enterprise companies, but that's how important community is. They have a community platform where the legal teams can hang out and talk to each other, solve each other's issues. They still do lots of events and then even, borrowing even further from the consumer playbook, they're big on TikTok.They have a guy named Alex Su, who runs this account, legaltechbro. It's really funny. And it's just him commiserating about how tough it is to be a lawyer inside of the enterprise. And that draws eyeballs. Patrick: Yeah, I was going to say, I'm going to go look it up. Sounds hilarious. Jess: It's hilarious. It's really funny. Anyway, I think there's a lot you can borrow from the consumer playbook and the community playbook and then bring that to all kinds of companies. Patrick: I really like the definition of community being a group of people who would be mad if you went away. That's such a simple, beautiful, elegant way to think about it. As you've studied companies that have done this well, whether you're an investor or not, who are the gold standards? I've mentioned the open source companies. I think there's some open source communities that are just... DBTs come to mind. The incredibly powerful communities of people that have been galvanized around whatever it is. What are the best ones that you've ever seen, and what features do you think make them the best? Jess: You know what I tell people is to go study Burning Man. Patrick: Okay. Let's get into that. Why? Jess: So there's this really old paper. I think it's called the Power of Community, and it talks about how you need four different elements to community. I think it's government, economy, religion and media. And I think Burning Man does that really well. The religion piece is you're supposed to have an ethos, a shared ethos in a way of doing things. That's just known. You have to have an economy. There has to be a real sharing of value between the community members. Burning Man, that's obviously food and water and whatever. You're literally a bartering economy. The ritual is the burner code, the principles, little rituals that you do. I don't know, making angels in the sand and just all the dressing up, but you feel like you belong to the religion of Burning Man. You exchange value and you give and you get out of the community. The media part is there has to be some relic or media about what this is that gets out into the world so it draws other people in. And so that's maybe the photos that you see of the crazy costumes. You're like, ""Wow, that looks fun. Maybe I should go."" Those I think are some of the key elements to building great community. But I think Burning Man does it like no other. Government, there's also the laws and the code. That's, in some ways, similar to religion, but the religion is a little bit more of the rituals of it. Patrick: Have you been to Burning Man? Jess: I've actually not been to Burning Man. My Burning Man that I go to each year is ComicCon. Patrick: That's another fascinating potential community. So I've never been, but maybe describe through the same lenses or through similar lenses, what is it about... Why do you go? What is it about that system that works? Jess: I just really love pop culture. I love Marvel. I love Star Wars. I'm a fan. I watch quirky. sci-fi shows, The 100. And a chance to escape into those worlds and then learn about the makings of the show and the people behind it and the actors, that's just what I love. I'm a fan, the ultimate fan. If you look behind me, literally my comic book collection. Patrick: I see Captain America's shield dead center in the bookshelves. Jess: I just love it. I go each year and it's a huge hassle to get into anything because there's 100,000 people there and only 7,000 seats in Hall H which is the hall where all the big panels come. You have to line up overnight for 30 hours with a group of people. And no one wants to stay 30 hours, so you have to rotate people in. There are literally shifts. You bring food, you camp out, you sleep overnight. You're dressed in full cosplay. It's just a little bit of an ordeal. There's little rituals around it. Some people need to escape to go to the toy place, to buy all the hot, new toys. You want to get into the panels and so you bond. We form this group once a year to go to ComicCon and hang out and just feel the energy of the crowd together in that hall and really just geek out about things. And in the line, you're next to some random people, but you know you are there for the Marvel cinematic universe panel and so you can talk about it together and hang out and you just make friends who are in the culture. Patrick: You mentioned a couple scarcity things there for ComicCon. What role does scarcity play in community? Jess: In ComicCon, I would say it plays a big role. Getting into Hall H and doing all of that, going through that ordeal, that's definitely not for everyone. But at the same time, families bring their four and five year old kids and just roam through the exhibit hall. So there's always, I think, a path into any community of seeing what it's like a little bit on the edges. Let's wander the halls of ComicCon and just look at the exhibits, and then there's for the true believer inner circle, hardcore nerds like myself, there's another experience. Patrick: Those are probably better examples than we'll ever come to with a business community. I'm thinking of Salesforce’s annual Dreamforce conference or something, but in business, what are the best examples that you've ever seen and how do they strike the balance between commerciality? Meaning I can draw a direct line from this thing to revenue or something, versus smarter, longer term plays of, ""No, no, the benefit here is we're cultivating a pool of demand that is differentiated."" Say a bit more about some of these ideas applied to business specific communities. Jess: I think the best communities and the best community builders are really oriented around the needs of the community and not just the needs of the business. I think that's one thing Ironclad does quite well. The early community dinners, the rooftop law series, it was not webinars on how to use Ironclad and why you need to use it. It was different people, different lawyers and GCs talking about topics that interested them and people attended, not because they wanted to learn about Ironclad, but because they wanted to meet the other members in the community, learn a little bit about some interesting law topic, commiserate, sure, and maybe there was some conversation about contracts here and there, but it was not about that. And I do think the best community builders are really oriented around, what does the community want? It's almost like their needs come a little secondary. Patrick: So it seems like then maybe it's about persona identification first. There's something that unites in each of these examples, maybe Burning Man excepted, but certainly lawyers, it's a category of people that probably have similar problems and similar experiences. Is that true of the best businesses that you've worked with or investments that you've made, that they just do a really good job of identifying who the customer is and understanding the customer and not trying to be a product that serves 10 different groups? Jess: Yeah. I think that goes back to our earlier point of product mindset and customer obsession. I think the best founders are customer obsessed. They talk to their customers all the time and then they're good at picking out, this is who we serve right now. And yeah, sure, maybe one day we'll serve everyone. But right now this is who we're focused on and we have to get this group so delighted and so happy that they tell their friends, and then the base expands little by little. But Eric Yuan and Zoom is actually pretty famous for this. When they started, they said, ""No,"" a lot to customers. I think he might have stiff armed, I think it was either Oracle or Cisco, all the way until IPO. They just said, ""No"" to the really, really big customers until post IPO, because he just wanted to be sure that they would be happy and that he could serve them well. And there's all the stories of companies that have expanded too quickly and lost that core and tried to be everything to everyone and I think that's one of the classic startup mistakes. Patrick: How do you avoid that mistake for a founder? What advice would you give them to know when it's okay to begin expanding? Jess: I think you need to talk to customers every week. That never stops being part of your job. You really have to have your finger on the pulse and know soon whether that enthusiasm is beginning to waiver or not. You can track your NPS data. You can instrument the heck out of it. There's a great tool called Sprigg that literally lets you push the customer NPS question or a series of questions out constantly and then categorize using AI the results. So I would just really instrument the business and then just, it's a cultural thing. It's a metrics thing. It has to be a personal obsession of the CEO, too.",3257
65,Jess Lee - Designing Investment Products,Formative Investing Experiences," Patrick: As you think about your own investing, like so many at Sequioa, you have extensive operating experience and now 70% of your time is spent making investments, what are the formative experiences or lenses that inform how you personally make investment decisions? What are the things you look for in companies and why those things? What about your experience or background led you to those criteria? Jess: Yeah, I think my experience as a founder is what's shaped my investing lens the most. I was a female founder running a company targeted at women, and I just remember my fundraising experience and my company building experience. It felt very lonely. There weren't a lot of other female founders that I could talk to, and there weren't a lot of investors who got what I was doing. I don't think I ever pitched a single woman and I would often get these comments like, ""Oh, is women's fashion a big market? Let me ask my wife about this."" I started to resort to this parlor trick of taking stacks of fashion magazines and slamming them on conference tables to try to get attention, also to get them to look at me instead of my male co-founder even if I was the one talking, and I would say, ""This single issue of Vogue magazine, the September issue, makes $100 million in a year, which is about the same as enterprise SaaS company you wish you invested in would make $100 million in one year."" Sadly, that's no longer the case anymore given what's happened with the media industry, but that's what I did at the time. And people would be like, ""Oh."" It would draw their attention and they would equate, at least the dollar amount, to realize like, ""Oh, you know what? Women are 50% of humans and 100% of us wear clothes. Maybe that is a big market.""But through that experience, it just really drove home for me that the people who make the investing decisions and their life experience biases, who they know as customers, really impacts what problems in the world get solved and which customers get served at all by technology. And that filled me with immense rage. I was like, ""It's really hard for us to raise money, because people don't think this is a problem, or don't see a lot of women's problems even though we control 80% of household purchasing power. We make 70% of healthcare decisions."" And so that was a big driver for me to even go into venture in the first place. I wanted to solve that problem. And it's a huge investment thesis of mine. And so I would say a larger thesis I have is there are underserved customers everywhere. You have to be a little contrarian to make money in investing. You have to either see opportunities other people don't or opportunities other people underestimate. You have to be willing to take a risk on things that maybe haven't worked before. And I just saw firsthand as a female founder and working on a product target women that, hey, there is big businesses out there that people don't think are big businesses and those underserved customers, if they are served, become wildly, deliriously happy, and then you get that, going back to the community point, a community and this incredible moat of community that leads to word of mouth growth. Patrick: On this issue, how would you describe or grade the progress since you started investing to now? Has this gotten better? Is it a little bit better? Give us a sense for the rate of change. Jess: Yeah, when I started and then when we started tracking the numbers, at All Raise, which is a nonprofit that I co-founded with 30 other women in venture that came out of this rage. They were 9% of check writers at VC firms were women, and now it's about 14, 15%, so it's definitely gone up in about four years. Sequioa's 25% women investors now. It's definitely moving in the right direction. Patrick: How true is that on the founder side as well? So we were talking to Roxanne Petraeus about this and the stats, I'm going to get them wrong, but it was like mid single digits percent of VC backed founders were women, but it was a even smaller percent of total capital, which is a bit of a lagging indicator, because most capital goes into later stage deals, but it's maybe the former stat's a better stat to focus on, whereas a more current stat, but it was 4% or something insanely low. What about that same question there? Jess: Yeah. Sadly the dollars flowing to female founders has not gone up. It's been about flat. It goes back a little bit some years, ahead a little bit, but it's basically about the same since we started All Raise four years ago. That's the next chapter for All Raise, how do we really step up and help the female founders. Patrick: What is driving that insanely low number? Jess: I do think who makes funding decisions impacts it and then there's just systemic bias. And I think the best way to overcome that is to have those great counter examples. The more there are companies like FIGS or Stitchfix run by women, targeting maybe this underserved consumer, not obvious, very capital efficient action, maybe because they had to be... Those are great winners, and the more of those there are for founders, the more full mode there will be. So, I think that's the path forward. We have to help probably queen-make some of these women. Patrick: How does this bias persist? To me in my operation as an investor, I haven't seen it because it just seems silly and crazy, and all the things that I think most sensible people would say about it, but it's obviously still there, persistent. It has some source. What have you learned about the source of it, or what perpetuates it? I'm trying to get the most root level here, not the surface-level thing on which you put a bandaid. What do you think it is? How is this a thing? Jess: I think there's a lot of different factors. One is, maybe you can't be what you can't see. The fewer big, successful women CEOs and leaders there are, the younger generation's like, ""Oh maybe that path is not for me."" I think it's definitely changing, but that's part of it. And then, I think there's just a lot of bias. You invest in what you know and what you understand. So, for all those people who said, ""Oh, it's women's fashion, big thing,"" it's because they just weren't the ones reading the magazines or buying the products that way. In my investing, I've tried to identify top-down who are consumers that are vastly underserved. One train of thought is, women often become the Chief Caregiver of the home, as well as the Chief Medical Officer of the home. You end up making a lot of the doctor decisions for the kids, or being the one to drop off, or decide what to do. Or maybe you stay home and don't work to take care of the kids, right? That burden tends to fall on women.That's actually a really big economic opportunity, too. So, I think there are really interesting businesses to be created that might be a little contrarian, at the intersection of serving these customers and creating economic opportunity. I work with a company called Maven. It's the largest telemedicine network for women's health and family health. So, it helps with the path to parenthood, fertility, IVF, pregnancy, postpartum. I used it extensively through two kids, and it's an incredible work benefit for employers who want to keep women, and have them come back, because 46% of women don't return to work after pregnancy. That is a huge bet on that thesis. On the caregiving side, I work with a company called Otter that helps you find care from other parents.",1760
66,Jess Lee - Designing Investment Products,Sequoia's Recipe for Culture and Company Building," Patrick: If you use All Raise, maybe as another example to talk about the power of community, how have you built that with respect to those ideas that you talked about earlier, to make this a strengthening, growing body of people that care about some set of things together? Tell me how you've applied the lessons of community to All Raise specifically, so we can learn a bit more about it. Jess: We gather people and put them together in rooms, and just try to get them to help each other, and try to help them with their careers, and that's it. It's not about All Raise and how you can help All Raise. It's really, how can All Raise help you? So, one of our most successful programs is actually really simple. It's just a cohort program, and you meet regularly with people who are at the same stage, GP or Associate, and just with your group. Out of that, magic happens, deal flow, new jobs, great investment opportunities. It's actually pretty simple. Patrick: From the community at Sequoia, obviously you get to work with some of the world's best investors of this type. How does learning happen inside the Sequoia community? I know you mentioned some examples already, someone observes something, turns it into a lecture or some piece of media... let's call it... that can be enjoyed and consumed. But what is the culture of learning like internally at Sequoia, in a way that you think other investment partnerships could mimic or benefit from? Jess: I think the reason Sequoia has been successful for five decades has a lot to do with culture. The same thing you hear from founders... culture eats strategy for breakfast, culture's the most important thing to get right... that's actually true at Sequoia as well. There's two parts to the culture, it's performance and teamwork. Performance is around the scale of ambition, to have the best fund in any vintage, to innovate. We're paranoid, we want to reinvent when necessary. That's quite powerful and it's led to a lot of innovation, from the Sequoia Capital Fund innovating on the financial structure, to being allowed to create an engineering team of our size inside of Sequoia, to the Scouts Program. Not every experiment works. We've shut down things that haven't worked, and so there's that. Then there's also, I think, the teamwork pieces and what you mentioned, learning is really important. It's very much an apprenticeship model. Our team's pretty small compared to a lot of firms, their investing team, and each person is apprenticed to someone. When I joined, I worked very closely with Bryan Schreier. He met with me every Monday, debriefed on every partner meeting. I shadowed other partners at board meetings, and got to see all the different styles of company building.Because, we're all very different. Sequoia has a diversity of styles, and so I got to see Alfred Lin on the numbers and say, ""This is the number you need to care about. That is a leading indicator of this huge mess that you're about to uncover."" Or Shaun can really connect you. He's got an incredible network, and might be able to get you to that one person. We all leverage each other's superpowers and strengths, but being able to shadow, we're very explicit about. ""Let's do debriefs after each meeting, so that what one person picked up can be shared with everyone else who might be newer."" Now, people shadow me at boards, and it's just that rigorous culture around teaching, and learning, and training the next generation, and empowering. There's a spirit of generosity. You hear sometimes at other firms about, ""Oh, I found this investment, and then the senior person snagged it from me."" It's almost the opposite. When I got to Sequoia, Roelof found what he thought was a great investment. He's like, ""This is great. Do you want to work on it?"" That's just how we roll, and it makes people want to stay, it makes people want to work there. That's combined with a high level of paranoia too. There's this constant, ""Are we good enough?"" Sequoia is very high in imposter syndrome internally. Patrick: Is that cultivated? Is paranoia something that... just the nature of the people there, so it's baked in automatically? Or, is it something that's actively cultivated? Jess: Both. Both. Absolutely. Any success we have today is because of work that was done 10 years ago. From an investment perspective, certainly. The investment that we made in a public- Patrick: Yeah, quite literally, right. Jess: Businesses that IPO today, that investment was made 10 years ago. So, we have to continuously monitor, and just make sure that we're ahead of the game. We monitor our founder NPS obsessively. We look at what competitors are doing. We are constantly questioning, ""Is this good enough?"" Every week. We're, I think, five weeks into the Arc program in Europe, and each week we're debriefing on how we make it better next week. It's just this relentless customer obsession. Patrick: You showed me the Captain America shield earlier, and then you mentioned superpower. So, I have to ask a fun question as a quick aside. Jess: Sure. Patrick: If you had to say which Sequoia partners are which Marvel superheroes, what pairings come to mind? Jess: Wow. Well, I definitely know who I am. Patrick: Okay. Who are you? We'll start there. Jess: Mantis, which is who I dressed up as for ComicCon. She's the one with a natural EQ, but is super weird. That's me. I can tell you the superpowers of all of our partners, but it's the mapping back to Marvel characters that makes that very hard. Patrick: You must map to Marvel. That's the rule. That's the rule of the game. Jess: Okay. Okay. Roelof is the Incredible Hulk. He got this Bruce Banner side where he's just an incredible genius, is capable of understanding sectors and industries to a really insanely deep level, from MongoDB to Instagram, to 23andMe. He's intellectually gifted, but at the same time he has this other side that comes out, that's powerful, and emotional, and very strong. That's probably Roelof. I think I would say Alfred is Spider-Man. Spider-Man is secretly everyone's favorite. At one point was an underdog and underestimated, but is really smart. Spider-Man invented his suit and all of that stuff, and is loved around the neighborhood. You have no idea how much Alfred is loved internally and by his founders. So, that's probably Alfred. I would say Pat Grady is Captain America. He's got a little bit of that boy-scout, good-human moral compass, all-American thing going on. Smart, great leader. Yeah. Yeah. He's definitely Captain America. Yeah. Man, that might be all I got for you. I can't think about- Patrick: That's way more than I expected, so we could stop it there. Jess: I'm really into these characters, and making those mappings, it was very important. Patrick: I'm glad we took a quick aside. Coming back now to something like Arc, which I know is a new program, sounds like it's brand new in Europe. Feels like a product, back to where we started the conversation, of the blending of investing and products, and product building. Maybe use Arc as a case study for me to help me understand your product mindset. What was the seed of motivation? What was the prime moving insight, or something? Then, how did the story unfold from there? Why do this? How did you do it? Using it as a case study sounds fun. I'd love to learn more about it. Jess: We're in our first class of Arc right now, but it's actually been four or five years in the making. It started at first with curriculum and a cohort program we designed for our Series A founders. The first version, we worked with a professor at the GSB, Garth Saloner, and Roelof was deeply involved, and we wrote 10 weeks of curriculum around the various company-building concepts, and tried it out. It got great reviews, and then we thought, ""Okay, how do we take this from maybe Stanford GSB-style case studies to a little bit more hands on?"" So, the next iteration, we started to work more with the earlier-stage founders, and we turned the case studies into frameworks of, ""Here is actually how you break down this case study into a framework that you apply for your own company."" Instead of talking about culture at Zappos and why it was important, let's break down the culture of Zappos, and break that down into a framework for what is a great core value. Is usually there's some pithy value statement. ""Deliver wow"" is one of Zappos's. ""Deliver wow,"" right?Then there's the behaviors. So, what does that mean? It means customer service is excellent. It means you can return things. It means we go above and beyond. Then, what's the legendary story that goes with that? For that, it's the story that goes legend, of the customer-service person who stayed on the phone for 10 hours with someone, and got them a pizza and let them return their shoes one year later. That is actually how people absorb culture. It's not whatever poster you stuck on the wall, it's that story that exemplifies that behavior. So, we broke that down. We work with founders to actually write out their culture. Then, in this iteration, I think we've expanded and we're adding new, different, types of learning. So, in addition to that framework, which might have been a deck at some point, a little bit of applying it yourself, there's actually a workbook, there's company-design cards, and we folded this all up into a concept we call ""Company Design"". The founders are the ones who are building the company, we're not company builders, but maybe we could play a role in helping them design, or architect, or apply the right design paradigms to their company.So, we think about that in terms of the core foundational concept, some of which are evergreen, some of which are more tactical and evolve over time. Think about community, think about mindset. I think that's maybe the biggest innovation of Arc this time around is... well, two innovations. One is, it's an open application process, which we never had before. Before, you would figure out some way to get in touch with a Sequoia partner. Now, this is an open application. So, you can apply, send in your pitch deck. We use data science to help us screen, but ultimately, we do look at every single application, a partner inside of Sequoia looks. Then, on top of that, we added a little bit more of these community and mindset elements. That trip to Klarna so you can just see, this is what greatness looks like. ""What's your scale of ambition? This is what it could be one day."" Just pushing people a little bit. Those are some of the things that, maybe, that's the case study of Arc and how it's evolved over time. But it's been five years in the making, through many iterations of the product. I think that's another part of what you do in product. You iterate, you ship an MVP, you iterate constantly, incessantly, until it's better, and better, and better. Then, you try to do bigger things along the way. Patrick: I can't remember what the exact ratio was, but I heard this funny recipe for great company building, that split things into stuff that you have to do that's completely innovative and new, stuff where you're improving in some meaningful way on the existing way of doing some things, and then some large percentage where it's just like, just do it the best way that people have figured out to do it already. Don't reinvent the wheel. Jess: Yeah. Patrick: It's convenient that I forgot the ratio, that the person... I think this is a Mark Pincus thing. If you think about those three things, what would your recipe be? If those were your three ingredients, what do you think that recipe looks like for the companies that you've worked with? Jess: I think there are one or two, or three things that really, really matter, where you have to innovate and delight, and what those three things are varies from company to company. Then, there's so much core people stuff. Over time, your job as a founder becomes not just product, but it becomes people. It's almost like the product that you're working on is actually the culture of the company, and the board chart, and the people, and all the management. There's a lot where you do not need to innovate too much, because it's not like human psychology has completely changed in the last five years. People are still motivated by... they want autonomy, and mastery, and purpose. So, you need to figure out how to solve for those three things. It's not like that changed suddenly in the last year. So, those are the areas where we really, really want to help you apply the best-of, to allow you to innovate on products, essentially. Technology. Patrick: In the areas of autonomy, mastery, and purpose, I think that's the Daniel Pink drive framework for thinking about professional motivation, or I guess just any motivation. What are the best ways you've seen companies respect that? Again, if this is one of those things that's in the category of, ""We kind of know how this works. Do these things, then the company gets better."" What do you think those things are? What are the best practices that you've seen for managing that group of people and keeping them motivated? Jess: Part of it is selection on the way in. Are you really hiring great people? Then, do you understand that great people often move on to do other great things. Some founders that get very, very mad when their early great people move on and they're like, ""You're dead to me."" That just has never made sense to me. People have ambitions of their own. Do you celebrate people who leave to start their own companies or go on to do different things, or decide that they want to be at an early stage company forever so they leave your now late stage company to go to an early stage company. How you treat people on the way out or just your whole attitude to that process I think reflects a lot. Patrick: Everyone always asks about what to do. What about what not to do? What have been the biggest mistakes, blowups, blunders that you've seen when it comes to this management of human capital in the organization? Jess: I think one of the biggest mistakes first time founders make that I certainly made is just not making expectations clear. I used to look at some folks on the team and be like, ""Why are they not doing their job?"" Or like, ""Why did they do it this way? It makes absolutely no sense. They're just not doing a good job."" And then I would learn something, like how to do a better operational framework, or how to set OKRs, or how to clarify customer personas. Like, ""Oh, it was actually my fault."" I did not explain what their job was or what expectations were or what goals I was trying to hit or who our customers were. And so there is an art to doing your internal storytelling of who your customer is, what the expectations are that it's not like you walk out of the room with that knowledge. You learn it over time. And that's a lot of what we try to teach founders in Arc. Here are the parts that you need to make really clear and how to communicate it really well so that your team can even know what their job is.",3653
67,Jess Lee - Designing Investment Products,How to Define Success and Other Big Lessons," Patrick: If you think all the way back earlier in your career to the time you spent working on Google Maps, what do you take from that experience? And I ask it in part because it's such a ubiquitous product that literally everyone has used that's a fabric of our daily lives. And if you step back and think about it, it's like one of the most remarkable things that exists on the planet. Can't believe it exists. What did that teach you about product? Jess: My favorite project inside of Google Maps was this thing called My Maps, which I think has not been touched for many, many years, but still Google has not been able to get rid of it. It's this feature that lets you create your own map. You can bookmark your favorite restaurants, draw a route. And it was at the time innovative because Google hadn't done a lot of user generated content. YouTube wasn't part of the picture yet. It wasn't a thing. This was in 2006 maybe. We had this tiny little team, I think five people inside of Maps. And we just went off and built this thing where anyone could make a map and we released it and it just exploded like wildfire. I remember we thought we were being dossed, but it was actually a wildfire in SoCal.And some radio station had made their own map of here's the safe zones, here's where the fires are, all this information. And it was getting so much traffic. We literally thought someone was attacking Google Maps and trying to take us down. And that really showed me the power of community. It showed me if you give people tools and then empower them, the results can be quite surprising. And I just remember what that small team was like. We were so passionate about this project. We were so below the radar of management because nobody cared about this feature, but that allowed us to work really, really fast with a lot of passion, a lot of user testing and it was an incredible experience. And that's part of why I decided I wanted to do startups next, was that a little tiny startup. Patrick: I love that. Jess: Nobody's been able to get rid of that feature. I'm sure that code's really old and sucks, but people want to make their maps. And if you took them away, people would be really mad. Yeah. Patrick: Who else inside of All Raise specifically, what other investors have you learned the most from and what have they taught you? Jess: There are so many incredible women inside of All Raise. Someone I really, really admire and have spent time with is Kara Nortman at Upfront. She's based in LA. She is such a generous spirit. And she has this way of bringing people together across industries to do really interesting things. So she created the women's soccer team, Angel City. Patrick: She sent my kids soccer gear to put a point on how generous she is. Jess: Right. She goes above and beyond, treats people really well. She's loved everywhere she goes. And so she was able to pull together and co-found, in her spare time, a soccer team with Natalie Portman. Patrick: Really cool jerseys too. Jess: Yeah. And really galvanize this energy down in LA and around women's soccer and to bring together... There's a lot of tech people involved in the soccer team. There's a lot of celebrity media people involved. But she just builds bridges across different communities. And I'm sure that's going to turn out to help her. I know it has helped her career wise, but she's just someone I really admire for her generosity and for her community building power. Patrick: If you now think forward around both your investing and product roles at Sequoia, how do you think about measuring success, let's say over like the next 10 years, if you're forced to define success? And I ask this question reluctantly because I'm not a big, hairy audacious goals person. I actually think they're counterproductive most of the time. But if you had to define what a great 10 years hence, I guess I'm especially interested around product because investing the answer is a number and returns and being the best. What does it look like? How would you define it? Jess: As a board member and a community builder and a product builder, I think I care about what my founders would say about me. The ones that I work with, would they say, ""Yes, Jess, Sequoia shifted our trajectory."" Obviously they did the heavy lifting, but there was that crucible moment, that difficult decision where I got maybe pushed one way or another or got a piece of advice that shifted the trajectory of a company just a little bit, a few degrees here or there to get us to where we needed to go. That's definitely one. Would they come to my funeral if I died? Do they care enough about me? And I care about them very deeply. We talk about not just resume virtues, but funeral virtues, like would they come and maybe you want to say a word? I don't know. And then I would want to look at the VC industry and see lots of firms innovating and changing the way things are done.We're not the only firm with a data science practice, but we're one of a few. And that really should be part of a lot of firms. If you have the budget and the fees for it, that should be part of your practice because otherwise you are just meeting other people in the Stanford GSB network. It's not that diverse and that's not the best way to find the next great company in Austin or Atlanta or Toronto. You have to seek those non-contrarian, non-obvious opportunities. And if technology were a little bit more involved, if people weren't just using Airtable and Salesforce to run their firms as like the only piece of software, I think that would be great. And then I also think about the percentage of dollars flowing to female founders. I care about that a lot. Equally represented. Are the problems of women being solved in the tech industry? Patrick: Wonderful set of criteria because they're very simple, they're measurable and there's a lot of ways they could be accomplished. I really like them. Jess, this has been a real pleasure. I'm so enamored with the way that you think about investing business, as evidenced by the things that you've actually already built and I'm sure will continue to build. And I'm looking forward to continuing to hopefully be able to call you and ask you questions as we try to tackle some of these same problems. I think the unique way that you're approaching this is refreshing and very interesting. And I've so enjoyed our conversation today. I ask everybody that I talked to the same traditional closing question. What is the kindest thing that anyone's ever done for you? Jess: I think the kindest thing that people have done for me is just believe in me when it was not obvious. A lot of people have taken career bets on me. The power of that belief of someone who's really good saying, ""No, I think you could do that,"" is really, really powerful and life changing for people. And several people in my career have done that. Marissa Mayer hired me as an APM at Google when I tanked in my interview and I was like, ""I don't know if I want this job."" That's probably not the best thing in the world to say in an interview, but she took a chance on me. Roelof and Jim at Sequoia took a chance on me joining Sequoia. I'd never done a single angel investment, not proven at all as an investor. And they were like, ""You know what? Let's give you a shot."" And it has not been a straight up and to the right journey by any means. But I'll always be really, really grateful for that. The power of that first believer is probably the kindest thing that anyone's done for me. Patrick: It's such a common answer that it makes me ask a quick follow-up which is maybe specifically at Sequoia, why do you think they did? What do you think it was that precipitated that bet? Because I'm amazed by the percentage of these answers that is some version of ""Someone that took a bet on me when there maybe wasn't complete evidence that it was a smart bet."" Why do you think they did in your case? Jess: The hiring spec at Sequoia is not too different from the hiring spec for founders, which is you need to have a spike somewhere. You have to have something you're exceptional at. Doesn't have to be the same thing across everyone, it just has to be a spike. You have to be really great at something. And then you have to have a lot of grit. This job is not for everyone. Being a founder is not for everyone. And there's going to be moments where you're like, ""Why did I do this?"" Or, ""Ugh, this is not working right now."" And you just have to manage your own psychology and keep going. That was one of the things Jim Goetz said to me. He was like, ""You need to be able to manage your own psychology."" Every investor at Sequoia has had a moment where they're like, ""Ugh, none of my investments are going well. This is not easy. Ugh, maybe I shouldn't be here."" How are you going to get through that valley? And I was like, ""Well, you know I ran a similar social company for my career. That was not very certain. And there were many near death experiences and I was surprised that we got out alive.” And so he was like, ""That's a pretty good answer."" Patrick: I'm sorry you're doing this to me, but you're making me think of follow-on questions so I got one more. You mentioned right before we hit record that we talked about Marvel, that you're just a pop culture junkie. What do you see in the pop culture landscape today that most has your attention? Jess: I love Marvel and Star Wars, but I also love my trashy reality TV shows. There's a show called “Love is Blind.” And it's a show on Netflix that is about forcing people to fall in love without seeing each other. You are stuck in two rooms with a wall in between you and you just talk to each other and you have to fall in love and propose to the other person. You have to find someone that you feel like you can connect with. Patrick: It's not just one person you're paired with. It's a selection. Jess: You date multiple people across many rooms, and then they follow what happens with those couples. And it seems like a contrived concept. Although I have to say, I almost debated starting a dating app with this very concept of getting to know people first before actually meeting or reviewing picture. To me that reflects this desire to return back to really getting to know people. It's like we're tired of this fake appearance based on swiping on Tinder, looking at people's perfect Instagram lives and just really wanting to get to know someone. We've been trapped in the pandemic for so long and apart from each other, I think there's this desire to go back to real deep connections. With the decline of church as a gathering function, you're not knowing your neighbors as much anymore, kids just sort of being on social or in games, I think there's a real thirst to get back together in person and to get to really know people. And so I think that is a big trend in consumer that I think about a lot. Patrick: We had a party yesterday to celebrate my kids' end of school and there was a moment when there's like a crazy amount of kids running around, jumping around and getting in trouble or whatever, and all their families around, and I couldn't agree more. It was weird to have the realization of how special this was because it's not been normal to be able to do this for several years. And just watching, it was like really beautiful to watch and just fun and everyone's laughing and there's music on and whatever. It's a great closing thought. Not complicated, but something that we're missing. Jess: Yeah. The thirst for community and for belonging. Patrick: Amen. Jess, this has been so much fun. So glad that we were able to do it. Thank you so much for your time. Jess: Thank you for having me.This site uses cookies to improve your browsing experience. By using this site, you are consenting to this policy.",2870
68,Kenneth Stanley - Greatness Without Goals,Introduction," Patrick: My guest today is Ken Stanley. Ken is a professor in computer science and a pioneer in the field of neuroevolution. He is also the co-author of a book called Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned, which details a provocative idea that setting big audacious goals can reduce the odds of achieving something great. We discuss that revelation in detail on how to apply it in our day-to-day lives. Please enjoy this great discussion with Ken Stanley.",105
69,Kenneth Stanley - Greatness Without Goals,The Best Way to Change the World," Patrick: So Ken, we were just together at Capital Camp this past week in Columbia, Missouri, and you gave, I think, what's proven already to be the most popular of the presentations during the week mostly because it really got people thinking, and we're going to try to replicate that phenomenon here today. I came across your work because of the book that you wrote with your co-author Joel called Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned. Then I'll probably refer to a few things that I read in the book throughout our conversation as sparks for our talk. There's one very early on that I think I'll start with that'll allow you to introduce the broad idea of your work, which is that sometimes the best way to change the world is to stop trying to change it, a provocative starting idea. Maybe you can use that as a jump off point to explain your research, your work, and its core thesis. Ken: That statement is a common saying. You hear things like that sometimes. The best way to find someone you love is to stop worrying about love or you hear these cliches sometimes. I think that that reflects that somewhere within our culture we recognize that there's a bit of a problem with setting goals and strictly adhering to them with this belief that that's ultimately going to cause you to get what you want. Yet what the book is about is that we have a tendency in our culture, a strong tendency, to basically design everything that we do around exactly that archetype, which is that let's set a goal, stay on our objective, and then let's set some metric so we can decide how close we're going to that goal, and then let's put all our effort into just moving directly in the direction of the goal. We believe somehow that this is going to lead to all the things that we need and want to accomplish, keep us ahead of the curve, avoid disruption, all the things that we're worried about, that this is the formula, basically, for everything. What the book is about is that it actually doesn't work. It's an interesting allegation to say that this doesn't work because it's not like most controversies. Most controversies in our culture are very controversial. There's already sides. People are debating these things, and they're often very political. This one, though, there's no debate right now. Nobody's talking about this. There are no sides. Patrick: How bad objectives are? Ken: Yeah. There's no protests out on the street about getting rid of objectives. I feel like this is a hidden problem, but I think the book we wrote, Joel Lehman and I, we felt after we ran into this principle, which comes strangely from artificial intelligence research, comes from a circuitous direction where the serendipity that we fell into noticing this that has social implications way beyond just artificial intelligence research. When we noticed this, we felt that this is actually a really serious problem, a serious underlying social problem because the mechanism that we're using in our society to deal with all of these huge challenges that we have is exactly this principle that is flawed, so severely flawed. So it's going to cause us to go astray over and over again. This goes all the way from a personal level where you have goals in your life which have been set since you were very young and encouraged by your parents and the educational system, all the way up to institutions like corporations and top of the government itself. All of these institutions and individuals are using goal-setting as the one heuristic for getting to high-level achievement. So the book tries to both say, ""Okay. Here's why this is something we shouldn't believe in with such confidence that we do and what are some of the alternatives,"" since that's the natural next question because it seems almost like, ""Then there's nothing I can do,"" or ""The only thing I can do is just be random,"" and that's not really the case. There are alternatives, which is why serendipity does happen. Chance favors the prepared mind. Patrick: The idea here is a big one, that we're a progress-oriented society and always have been, and that our principal tool for achieving progress, the objective and the achievement of the objective is in some ways deeply fundamentally flawed. I want to be very clear, because you are in your book, about what kinds of objectives you mean. I don't think you mean the very simple, straightforward things. I think you mean the BHAG, the big, hairy, audacious goal. Can you just make sure that we level set on the kinds of things that your work addresses and maybe the kinds of things that it doesn't? Ken: Thanks for putting in that caveat because that's really important, I think. I can lose a lot of people by just starting out with this crank-like claim that we should have no objectives, whatsoever, in our lives like, ""Let's all just do whatever we want."" Okay. That's going to appeal to some very small minority, but that doesn't sound practical to a lot of people, and that's true. The claim here is not that we're just going to dump all objectives. Some objectives are principled. Yeah, I would agree with the distinction you're making. It's like BHAG ideas. Those are the ones that are of concern. So if you have what I call modest objectives in your life or if institutions have those, I think those can be reasonably pursued as they generally are. I want to improve my lap time or something by exercising at the track or something. That's reasonable. We know that, and people have done that very reasonable things. It's not extremely innovative or maybe we're going to upgrade our software to the next version. This has been done numerous times as a corporation. This is not a hugely controversial thing. We can set that objective and we can move towards it. We can even set metrics and things like that.What I'm talking about is more related to things like innovation and discovery and disruption, blue sky stuff, some extreme examples of things like cure cancer or achieve artificial general intelligence, super ambitious things, but even things that aren't as ambitious as those would fall under this category, basically stuff where we just don't know how to do it, which is a huge, huge range of things that are very important to us, things like bringing down inflation or something like that. So that's not the same as curing cancer, but the problem is that we don't know what exactly the stepping stones are that lie along that path to doing those things. As soon as that's true where the stepping stones are mysterious, especially if there's several of them that we have to go through on the road to where we want to go, then this principle that I'm talking about, which I might call the myth of the objective or you call it the objective paradox, where it's setting an objective actually hurts your ability to get to it, so that's a paradox, then it starts to come into play with those kinds of things.",1507
70,Kenneth Stanley - Greatness Without Goals,The Story of Picbreeder," Patrick: In the book and in the presentation you gave last week, there's a key central example that, like you said, you stumbled upon via some of your own research. I would like to walk through that story. I want to just plant the key idea before we do that with another quote from the book, which is that, ""Almost no prerequisite to any major invention was invented with that invention in mind."" You used that term stepping stones, the things that we combine. You gave the example of vacuum tubes and computers. People working on vacuum tubes weren't thinking about computers, and there's a million examples like this. So I just want to plant that idea out there. The stepping stones thing not resembling the final invention is the reason why it can't be so deterministic, and here's our objective, set up the steps between now and there. Maybe you can start to introduce that concept via the Picbreeder example that I think was the way that you originally alighted upon this idea in your research. Ken: It's neat because, in a way, this is a story of serendipity, which is about serendipity. I mean, basically, this pic breeder just serendipitously led to this insight. Picbreeder was an experiment that I was running with my lab. I was a professor at the time at the University of Central Florida, where we allowed people on the internet to go and breed pictures. I know this is a major digression from what we were just discussing. We were discussing all these important things and we're talking about breeding pictures. So how do these things connect? Breeding pictures, it is a little esoteric from general societal concerns perspective, but it's basically about searching through a space in a way. This was an opportunity for us when we were doing artificial intelligence research to crowdsource. Crowdsourcing is really interesting. Let's say you to take people on the internet because you've got access to potentially thousands, millions of people and have them try to do something collectively. Wouldn't have been possible in the past if you didn't have access to the internet. What we wanted to do was to crowdsource people, to search through the space of images or pictures and what that meant. So we used breeding. So basically, what it meant was that you could take an image, say a blob or something, and in fact, the site would start you off with random blobs if you started from scratch and you could say, ""Look at some blobs and you could pick the one you like the best,"" just like you might if you were breeding horses or dogs, ""Pick the one you like the best."" You might have different reasons or criteria, but whatever your criteria is it's fine, and then it would have children.So it's a little strange. It sounds strange. The picture has children, but this is inside of a computer. So if you think about it, why not? The picture can have children. The children or the offspring of the picture are like any other children. They look like it. They're not exact duplicates just like if you have children, they look a little bit like you. They're not exact duplicates of you or your spouse either. That's the case here. So then what's cool is that then you can see that if your picture that you chose has children, then you can look at the children and then you can pick from those children which one you like the best. You can see that this is in effect breeding. So then out of those, you pick your favorite there. It has children, and then you get to choose from those, and then so on and so forth. You're basically iterating generations of breeding, where it goes depends on what you choose up to you. To tie this back quickly, what does this have to do with anything? If you think about those images, they're basically a metaphor for discovery in general. If you think about like what you said about vacuum tubes and computers, computers are a discovery, vacuum tubes are a stepping stone on the road to that discovery. So somebody chose to use those vacuum tubes to try to build a computer. When it comes to image breeding, if I see an image that looks like something interesting, and then I choose to breed it further and then I get something else, maybe a picture of a skull, which actually was discovered, then I basically used that stepping stone to get to a discovery. So somehow, there's a metaphor, an analogous metaphor here.What's cool about this site, what made it, I think, compelling to me was that because it's crowdsourced, what we allowed people to do was to come in and look at what other people had bred. So there's this big database and it's being displayed in a natural way, a way that makes it easy for people to see what's been discovered to surface things that are interesting. So those you can think of as stepping stones. You might see a butterfly or a face or something like that. Then someone who sees that is allowed to instead of starting from scratch, instead of starting from blobs like you would if you were starting from scratch, they can start from your discovery. If you found a butterfly and somebody wants to breed new butterflies, then no problem. They don't have to start from scratch and get to a butterfly. They can start from your butterfly and then breed from there. It's called branching. So that means that people are building off of the discoveries of their predecessors or you could think of as standing on the shoulders of their predecessors, which is, again, it's a really nice analogy, I think, to how human innovation proceeds in general, where someone invents something, discovers something, comes up with an idea, and then someone else that they might not even know later in the future goes back in history and sees that thing and realizes this could be used for that, and it transfers that idea over and it becomes a stepping stone to something else. This has been going on for as long as civilization, basically is civilization. That's what basically causes civilization to happen. So pic breeders are a microcosm of that, but here's where the thing that leads to the insight that's profound and to me was shocking was that after running this site for a couple years, so this is a long time, and letting people just breed and discover things and they discovered all kinds of things, butterflies and cars and planets. Patrick: We'll put a link in and a collection to some of these. It's really staggering, the things that you see that started with black blobs. Ken: Yeah. Yeah. So you'll get a chance to see it. They found all this stuff after a couple years of watching this. Then what we found was that underneath the hood, we were able to look at how. If you think about just for a second, just think about why Picbreeder is fascinating. At first, it might seem like a toy or something. What is it actually for? People are playing around and breeding images, which have no purpose other than just that they're images, but actually, what is, I think, profound about having something like that is that it is basically a history of discovery in all of its minute detail. Every little thing that everybody decided to do throughout the history is recorded. We don't have artifacts like that. We don't know every step of every invention that's ever been made. A lot of it just happened inside of someone's head. So this is not recorded, but Picbreeder is one of the few things, maybe the only thing where every single step of everything is recorded completely. So that meant that after a couple years, we could go back and find out what actually explains how everything was discovered, and I turned out to be, I think, shocking. The shocking revelation was that in almost every single case, more than 99% of cases, if you looked at something interesting, like a car, for example, or a butterfly or a bird or whatever it might be, if you go back in its history and you look at what were the steps that led to that thing, the steps look nothing like it at some point back. Right before you get to it, it might look like it, but if you go back far enough, you will find a stepping stone that looks absolutely nothing like it in 99.9% of cases.Why is that a revelation? Well, the problem is that if you think about it, what that means is that the only way to discover any of these things was to not be trying to discover them. Now, usually if you say things like that, that sounds like some new age statements, discover things by not trying to discover, and that's mystical or something. Now, think about this. I'm not talking in the new age perspective. This is an empirical observation. This is actually what happened. The people who discovered these things who are responsible for the stepping stones that led to the discoveries were not actually trying to discover those things because if they had been, then they wouldn't have chosen the things when they had their selections. They had these blobs they could look at. They could choose one of them. They wouldn't have chosen the ones they chose if they were trying to get the final product. For example, you have a case where there was an alien face that led to a car. Who would choose an alien face if they want a car? That would not be a good idea, but what happened was the wheels of the car, which was depicted from the side, actually derived from the eyes of the alien face. Again and again and again, you see this phenomenon that in hindsight, you can see what happened, but looking forward, you would never imagine that these connections could be made. This shows, in fact, it's true in Picbreeder that you can only find things in the long run by not looking for them. You need to take your eyes off the ball in order to be able to accept the stepping stones that ultimately make finding the ball possible, which I think is totally contrary to our culture, to our way of making discovery, the way we think things should be done, which is always objectively driven. So the connection that I need to make, I think, beyond that is to justify why I would extend from that discovery to real life. Patrick: If you think about the power of these images, most of them were achieved across what I'll call a modest amount of generations. We'll talk about AI and machine learning a little bit later on, which is so interesting because almost all of it has an objective function. It's almost all objective-based. So that'll be an interesting part of our conversation, but when you put up the number of generations of breeding to get from a blob to a clear bird, let's say, it was only 80, 90, 40, 100. It wasn't that many iterations. Then you showed us a skull, a picture of a skull, and really drove the point home by describing, ""Okay. Now, let's imagine this specific skull or one very close to it is our objective."" Could we get close to it across way, way, way more generations and actually targeting it? Maybe you can describe that experience because I found that to be a powerful nail in the coffin. Ken: So basically, we took this and we said, ""Let's try to drive the point home and also just see if we can validate this hypothesis that you can only find things by not looking for them by actually looking for them explicitly."" Just to make it fun, I think this twist makes it fun, let's look for things that we already saw were discovered. That makes this crazy because it's like we know that these can be discovered in this space. Like you said, I think it is an important point that these things were not discovered with a lot of compute, so to speak. If I recall, I think it's 72 generations, might be 74, 72, 74 steps or iterations. That is just ridiculously low. When you think about it in terms of compute, of course, these are humans making these selection steps, but in machine learning, modern machine learning, it's pretty reasonable to have millions of iterations to get to something meaningful. Here, we're talking about dozens. In some way, that says these are easy. These are not hard discoveries. In some sense, they're still impressive because of the fact if I just randomly choose blobs in blob space, in the space of the Picbreeder, you'll never find anything. 99.99999% of the space is just garbage blobs. So these are still needles in haystack, but what's weird is that the needles in the haystack are discoverable within a few dozen steps. One conclusion you might draw naively would be that, ""Oh, they can't be that hard to find."" The skull is let's say 74 steps trivial, basically, from a compute perspective. So let's set up an experiment and see. So what we can do is we can say, ""Let's get an image matching algorithm,"" which are available, which basically tells me if I show this algorithm a blob, I input this blob and I ask it to compare it to the skull, it'll tell me how far away we are, how close is this image to a skull.That comparison will help me because when I show a bunch of blobs, I can just have it automatically pick the one that's closest to the skull. It's really simple. Then every iteration can be done now by the computer instead of by a human. So we can automate it. Good old fashioned machine learning here. We just automate Picbreeder. No more humans in the loop, and we'll just automate it to go to the skull. I think to me, this sounds like a worthy adversary. I would be worried this might actually work. It shouldn't work though our hypothesis is correct because our hypothesis here is that you can only find things by not looking for them. Now, this is explicitly looking for the skull. This is a metaphor for how we do things in our culture. So we say, ""This is our goal. This is our OKR. This is what we're going to achieve this quarter, and now we're going to work towards it. You're going to give me a metric. In this case, it's skull matching. Let's match the skull picture,"" and then you're going to cut off branches that don't seem to be maximizing that metric and go by the branches that do seem to be maximizing the metric and just move towards the skull. We're going to do that now explicitly. We gave it 30,000 steps. This takes about 74 steps, let's say, for the first discovery by a human. Now, we're giving an automated algorithm, 30,000 steps, just for fun, just in case, I don't know, it needs extra time. We'll give it way extra time, orders of magnitude. What happens? Failure every single time. We ran this dozens of times. It's every single time failure.It's also fun to look at the failures because you can see it's trying. You see it shadows. It's like somebody stumbling, almost getting there but not quite. Well, it's not even close, but it's like getting the silhouette shadow of what it wants, but it can't get even close. It's just fascinating. That's much more compute. It should be able to eventually overcome it, but the thing is that it highlights the reason that this is happening in if you look at it. Why are all discoveries happening this way in Picbreeder? It's actually because the world is deceptive, which means that the things that lead to skulls don't look like skulls. This is the fundamental insight, which is not being recognized across society. It's that the things that lead to the things you want don't look like the things that you want. There's actually a name for this in philosophy. It's called the like causes like fallacy. I think it's from Mills. We all seem to assume. It seems to be almost like built in to us biologically that the things that lead to what we want are going to resemble what we want. I don't know why we all believe this, but it's not how the world works. If you think about it, that makes total sense. If the world actually worked that way, if the like causes like fallacy was actually true, actually things do resemble where you want to go, we would solve all that problems. Patrick: Cancer would be cured, yeah. Ken: Exactly. It's like it would be obvious what to do. We'd always just choose the thing that's getting closer to the goal and then it would eventually get there, but if you really think about it, how could the world work that way? That's a ridiculously naive view of the world. The world is complex. What does the word complex even mean? If that was true, then there would be no such thing as complexity. Complexity basically means that everything is circuitous and hard to understand. Hard to understand means that the things that lead to the things you want aren't the things you want. They're very complex. So you need to do things like work on vacuum tubes to get to computers because vacuum tubes are in the first computers, even though vacuum tubes don't seem to, on the face of it, have anything to do with computers at all. If you're just working on vacuum tubes 100 years before computers, what does that have to do with computation? Nobody working on them was thinking about computation, whatsoever. This is true, like you said, when I made this statement, which I think is just intrinsically controversial.None of the stepping stones to any major invention were invented with that invention in mind. That's why this is true. I think that that's hard to digest that statement because it sounds absolutely insane, but it's actually true. If you go back far enough and you look at this prerequisites, the stepping stones, you will find things where you could never predict. So the problem is you are absolutely dooming yourself. If you are trying to find things that look like where you want to go and you're trying to go a far away, you're screwed. You'll never get there. That yet is how we're running our institutions. This is institutions like the granting agencies, like the National Science Foundation all the way down to your innovation lab inside of your company over and over again guided by objective principles. What should we do about the fact that this actually doesn't make any sense?",3929
71,Kenneth Stanley - Greatness Without Goals,The Role of Individuals Versus Consensus," Patrick: There's one piece of this that I love that hasn't been mentioned yet, which is the role of the individual and their decisions relative to I'll call this heterogeneous decision making versus homogeneous ruling by committee or something or making choice by committee. Talk about the importance of the individual and their choice in this web of invention and disruption. Ken: Yeah. This is a funny thing. It's true. This is another very popular mythology, I think, in our culture is let's get together and collaborate, bring all the smart people into the room. It's not just like, ""Let's get interdisciplinary collaboration. Let's get the computer scientists sitting there with the economist."" All these things are very exciting to us. I just want to say I'm not saying we shouldn't have collaboration. That again would be this crazy cranky thing to say. What I do want to get to what you're asking about is that collaboration itself also is subject to a number of caveats because of the insight about the paradox, the objective paradox, and that means there's a right way and a wrong way to think about collaboration. It's quite dangerous. We tend to do it the wrong way. The issue that comes up here is that if you look at Picbreeder, I think something that's very intriguing about what happens in it is that once somebody sees a stepping stone on the site, so if you recall, like I said, all the discoveries that other people had made are made available for you. So what it means is you are seeing a history of stepping stones when you go to this site. You don't have to start from scratch. If somebody found a butterfly, you can start from their butterfly.When you come in and see that butterfly, that is a point of collaboration. It's implicit collaboration, but it is collaboration because somebody else did work, they found the butterfly, and now you're building off of that work. So collaboration is happening. However, the moment you choose to continue or what we call branch from the butterfly to breed it further, you are on your own. This is a very unique thing. At first, it sounds like, ""Oh, well, what's the big deal? You're on your own, okay,"" but think about it. We almost never allow people to do that in collaborative situations in our culture. We always bring people together and move towards consensus almost immediately, but in Picbreeder, it's not like that. Instead, you choose the thing you think is interesting and it was your choice and nobody else was involved in that choice. Now, think about this compared to, for example, I was a professor for a long time. So I think a lot about asking for grants, science grants. That's like picking an image. It's like what project do I want to pursue. You come in and you see a butterfly and you want to pursue the butterfly. It's like you're sending a grant proposal to the NSF. You think something interesting will happen if you choose this butterfly, but the thing about the NSF is now it's going to go to a committee. I am not allowed to just go off on my own and work on that butterfly now. There's going to be a committee that thinks about the decision that I'm making, and I have to justify usually objectively in the sense that I'm going to have to say where it's going to lead.What are you going to get by doing this butterfly? That is not how Picbreeder is. You are on your own completely, and not only are you on your own by choosing the butterfly, you're on your own every single step of the way until you publish the thing you discovered. So there's no interference, whatsoever, and you're just on your own. Think about the difference between that and the way we run things where it's basically you come into a room with all these people, you bring up these ideas, you have this discussion, you try to come to consensus. All the crazy things you would've done are basically cut off at the start by this surge towards consensus, which is going to lead to what I would call convergent consensus because we're trying to move toward convergence very quickly. What you'd understand from Picbreeder is the proliferation of the stepping stones that gives the power to the process. The reason that I can get to cars, there was a discovery of a car which came from an alien face, was because of the discovery of the alien face. No one would ever think that you needed an alien face to get to a car, but the alien face is there not because somebody was thinking about cars, but because there is a general culture inside of Picbreeder of proliferating stepping stones.This is not generally how we run collaborative systems because we run them by consensus, which is the exact opposite. That's about pruning out stepping stones. People start generating things and then we start saying, ""No, no, no. Committee doesn't like this. Committee doesn't like that."" We then converge to the thing, which is basically the consensus basis of current thinking, which tends to be dogmatic and tends to be status quo and everything that we basically want to get away from, and then all these radical stepping stones, which are the interesting things which could lead to places we're not expecting for the very reason that the things that we'd want to get to don't look like them so we need the radical stepping stones are the things that we cut out. You can see from this theory or philosophy way of looking things that a lot of the way we run collaborative systems is just totally kneecap at the start, and also should, I think, be rethought. Patrick: Can you describe when you put a consensus mechanism into this experiment, the outcome falling to all this? I promise we're going to get to some of the bigger implications here in a minute, but this simplified example is this so damn powerful for how we all are going to spend our time in our lives. Maybe just describe the outcome when you insert consensus mechanism into how these generations progress. Ken: This is super interesting, and it's funny because it's just a coincidence that this happened because there was another project that was launched around the time of Picbreeder called the living image project. It had nothing to do with me other than it used basically the same in coding under the hood as Picbreeder. This is nice because it creates a controlled experiment by accident because both Picbreeder and this other thing, the living image project, have this underlying coding that's the same. So what that means is in principle, they can achieve the same thing. They could find similarly cool stuff in principle, but there's this one difference, which makes this very interesting as a comparison, which is this living image project did work by consensus. I mean, the reason it did is because I think it's because there's this cultural assumption just like riding on top of that. They're like, ""This is a good way to do things. Let's have a vote.""So basically what they said is, ""Okay. Here's what we're going to do. Just like Picbreeder, there's these blobs, they're arranged on the screen, you can see all these blobs, and we're going to pick one of them. That'll be the parent of the next generation of blobs."" However, the difference from Picbreeder is that the choice will be made by a vote. So over the course of a week, people will come in and it would turn out basically hundreds of people would come in, and they would vote on their favorite blob and then we'll choose the one that gets the most votes. To a lot of people, this is really intuitive. More opinions are better than one. Let's use the crowd to decide what to do, but consistently with what I just argued, the result are starkly different and terrible in comparison. I don't mean to cast any dispersion on the living image project. I think it was a cool idea to try it. It really helps to illustrate. The problem here is that you get a washout effect. Imagine you come in, okay? There's hundreds of people coming in. Imagine you like butterflies and I like cars. Now, what's going to happen when we vote and we're just looking at blobs? The blobs don't look like butterflies yet and they don't look like cars, and you want a butterfly and I want a car. What is going to happen? Complete washout is what's going to happen.There's no way you're going to get enough people on your side. You don't even know. We don't even know what each other are doing or have understanding of how you even get these things. So what's going to happen is you get this mildly aesthetic blobby pattern type of consensus. We get the mildly, most pleasing blob aesthetic, and then that's going to happen at every iteration because there's another few hundred people voting at the next iteration and another few hundred, and after thousands and thousands of, I think it was 25,000 votes, you can look at the top ranking, all you have are amorphous rainbowy blobs every single thing. I think it's just stark and shocking. Even though it's in this totally obscure genre of stuff like breeding pictures, I think it should give us all heart palpitations because we're running our culture this way.",1993
72,Kenneth Stanley - Greatness Without Goals,Vacuum Tubes and Other Innovations," Patrick: You mentioned vacuum tubes. What are some of the other favorite examples of this happening in the real world because we have been talking about a low dimension, quaint, back water part of the internet, messing around with pictures? When we zoom out to the real world, what are some of your favorite examples that have actually happened? Ken: I know you already brought it up, but I think it's one of my favorite examples from the real world because it's very thought-provoking. It's the vacuum tubes and computers because it goes over hundreds of years, and I think it's very helpful to illustrate what I'm talking about. I think we have this myth, this tale that we tell about almost everything has ever been achieved by humankind, which is very objectively driven, the narrative of achievement. It's like some amazing visionary just sat down and said, ""We're going to overcome all the obstacles and just do this amazing thing,"" like make a computer. Let's think about that, for example. When that was done in the 1940s, there was a military motivation at the time we needed these computation machines and so forth. We had reasons we wanted these things, but you could tell the story as if it's this objective triumph. We got together the best minds. They put their effort into it. They build this thing. It just happened. That's just the story of human achievement. What a great thing we should all celebrate.The the thing is you're leaving something out. We're leaving something out in those kinds of allegories. There was stuff that happened before that. The story doesn't start where it starts, and that makes the story extremely misleading because that's not actually the story because there were things that we needed to build that computer, just as there were things we needed to build the space shuttle and so forth, all your favorite stories of human achievement, airplanes, what have you. It'll be the same thing, but to focus on the computer, the thing that we needed, one very key thing is a vacuum tube. Now, today, computers aren't made out of vacuum tubes, but in the 1940s, the first computers had vacuum tubes in it. The first ones that actually worked and were used and produced, not mass produced, but produced, and actually used for purposes, they had vacuum tubes. So the thing that really made it possible to have this narrative about, ""Oh, there's this amazing visionary,"" was the fact that somebody already had invented vacuum tubes. Patrick: What is a vacuum tube? I don't even know where that is. Ken: A vacuum tube is a electrical device. In the early computers, it was used as a small unit of computation. Early on, they were trying to understand properties of electrical devices in general. They weren't thinking about using it for computers at all. It allowed people to understand what you can do with electricity. It goes back to, I believe, the 1700s, basically glass tubes with vacuums, where they could run electrical currents through them and learn about their properties. If you go back to those times, which is going actually hundreds of years before you get to computers, what you find I think is very interesting, which is that you find people who are interested in electrical properties who were not thinking about computers, but these people are an essential part of the story of computation. That's the part that's left out of the narrative. The hero of the story is partly the vacuum tube researcher, but the vacuum tube researcher has not a single thought about computation. This is where we should get worried again because if you go back in time, go back to the year 1850, roughly around a hundred years earlier before the first computers, the Eniac computer, you could find these people who were doing that work, and what we could imagine a thought experiment here where we could approach those people because they're super smart. They're the hackers of the day.So we could go to those people and we could say, ""You're doing something interesting, granted, but there's actually something much more interesting you could be doing, which is you could build a computer. What the heck are you doing with this boring vacuum tube stuff? Let's build something like a computer. I can tell you a little bit about what the vision of the computer is. Now, why don't you think about that instead? Let's get you guys together and do that."" If you think about this thought experiment, it would be a horrible thing to do because you just pulled all the people off the stepping stone that you needed. If you think about this alien face was used to get to a car in Picbreeder, if I took the person who is working on the alien face and pulled them off of it in the middle of their session and said, ""Actually, I'd rather you try to read a car. That would be more interesting,"" then you'd have neither. You'd have neither an alien face nor a car. It's the same thing with the vacuum tubes and the computers. You pull the people off the vacuum tubes and you make them work on computers. Well, you just took out the stepping stone that leads to computers. So you can't do either. So we would have neither vacuum tubes nor computers. This is, I think, a dramatic illustration of the fact that Picbreeder does exist in real life and that not respecting that is devastating. You absolutely destroy innovation if you try to control it in the way that we do try to control it. It's just serendipitous luck that these stepping stones got front. Luckily, they were not part of some institutional attempt to control where we're going because if they were, they wouldn't have happened. Patrick: You start to see this everywhere, whether it's induction coils with air travel or mold and penicillin or Viagra coming from a hard medication. I mean, all these weird things were rather than someone saying at the end of an invention cycle, ""I've done it,"" it almost always seems to be like, ""Huh, that's funny. Something weird is going on. There's some other use."" I even remember, I think it was Nintendo. There's some great line about how Nintendo proceeded with its innovations, and it was something like lateral innovation with withered technology, combining old random stuff together to produce some new outcome, which I think brings us to the prescriptive. So we were talking about the key observation here. The steps don't resemble the final thing so it's almost impossible to actually achieve. Like you said, I love the delineation of we don't know how to do something is the goal that we're talking about here, not something that we've done in the past, and we need to get practical here. So it's both scary and exciting that the greatest things that any of us might accomplish are not something that we can imagine or something that we could accomplish through just a linear progression. So I'd love to describe what you think this means for how people should behave, especially ambitious people that want to achieve great things or affect big change or create wonderful innovation or disruption, all the things that everyone listening probably wants to do. We've just been told we shouldn't pick it objective. We should just mess around. So what does that mean? I especially liked how you talked about objectives being very future-oriented, whereas your prescription being maybe more past-oriented in terms of interestingness and novelty. Let's start to talk about how this might actually affect what we do with our lives. Ken: Yeah. That is the natural question then. How should we conduct ourselves given this critique of how we generally do conduct ourselves? I just wanted to add one little point just to emphasize how broadly applicable this is that we're not only talking about technology, right? The examples I've been giving are very technical, computers or something, but this is about genres of art. What leads to what in art? What leads to what in musical genres? What economic systems, political systems, financial strategies? Everything is about this. It's not even just about things we want to accomplish. It's about things that we don't know we want to accomplish, but we would want to if we knew they could even be possible. That could be what you're going to do in your life. You may create something, come up with some idea that you weren't even aware was something worth trying to do but turns out to be awesome. So all these things fall under the umbrella of this idea. Okay. So how should you conduct yourself? It seems like a lot of people jump immediately to the word random. Basically, you're just saying, ""I should just be random."" It's like, ""I'm going to cry. This sounds terrible. I don't want to be random. I'm a smart guy. I can do things for intentional reasons.""I just want to start just to say this is not suggesting that anybody should just act randomly. That's not a good strategy, obviously. It's not an alternative strategy at all. It's just as dumb as the original strategy, but let's acknowledge, though, that the original strategy is also dumb. One thing that you have to digest here, which I think is really hard to accept, is that there is no good strategy to achieve a specific thing that we don't know how to do. There's just no principled way to do that. What I can give you advice on is how to maximize the chance of achieving something useful, but not a specific thing. So this is the pivot that you have to do, I think, when you're talking about innovation. You have to understand that a successful inventor, somebody who gets to places that we haven't gotten before, is somebody who's open-minded and willing to keep a repertoire of stepping stones around without knowing which one is going to be the payoff. You have to drop this idea that there's this one thing which is the goal and we're going to have this metric-based assessment thing, and we're always going to be moving towards it. It just doesn't work, but you can be principled if you're trying to maximize opportunity to have some success, even though we don't know what that success will be.The reason you can do that is because if you think about something like Picbreeder, it's basically like a stepping stone collector. That's actually what makes the system powerful, and stepping stone collecting is anything but random because if you think about it, it's the stepping stones themselves that lend the power to the system and the stepping stones are there because they're interesting. They're not random. You go to Picbreeder and you see a skull and a butterfly and a car. There's nothing random about any of that. A random thing would be like a blob, but you see these things that have meaning. So they actually give power to the system because the thing is that things that are interesting are stepping stones to other things that are interesting. That is the true structure of the world. That's the structure of search spaces is that when you find something interesting, it has a potential. It's not just interesting for what it is now, but for what it leads to. To give a concrete example of that, sometimes I think about the iPad. The iPad is clearly interesting in its own right in the sense of the things you can do with it. One of the things that to me makes the interestingness of the iPad real is the fact that there were these lines snaking around the block when the first iPads came out. What I like to think about is why. Why were lines snaking around the block for people who just wanted to get the first iPad? I would submit, at least I believe, that it's not just because of what you could do with the iPad, which is cool enough as it is, it's because almost everybody saw that it's a stepping stone. What was interesting about the iPad wasn't what you could do with it, it's that we don't know all the things that you might do with it that we don't know yet. It just opened up an entire new world that we don't know about. That is a powerful stepping stone.Human beings understand stepping stones. That's one of the reasons we shouldn't be so scared at the message that I'm giving here. This is actually one of our special skills. So there's basically two pieces of advice I would give. One is collect stepping stones and honor interestingness. That is a system that we need to establish. You can do that as an individual and we can do that as an institution. We can actually try to explicitly do this institutionally and we don't, and it's a very interesting opportunity, I think, because it's so little studied. It's like a low hanging fruit, I think, that's ripe for exploitation. The second piece of advice is the more visionary angle, which is to recognize stepping stones when they snap into view for the first time. This is what I think happens in the misleading narratives that usually are characterized as objective triumphs. Think of the iPhone. Did Steve Jobs just sit there and say, ""Okay. We're going to build this crazy thing. It combines a phone with a computer, and blah, blah, blah, sits in your hand""? This genius, he just saw this a lot far off vision of doing something like that. That's the narrative we usually get for something like that, but I don't think that's the actual truth. The real thing that happened there was he was the first person to recognize that all the stepping stones had suddenly been laid to make that actually objective possibility. Things that were objectively unrealistic suddenly become possible when the stepping stones are laid, but you need to keep an eye on the stepping stones to know when that moment happens. We see this mistake happen over and over again, which is when vision trumps stepping stones.It's like self-driving cars. We heard as far back as, I don't know, 2016 or so, right around the corner next year, that is the false visionary type of situation where it's like somebody's being really ambitious, but the stepping stones haven't been laid. You have a false understanding of where we are and you think that the stepping stones are there, but they're actually not. It's going to take a while. I'm not saying they'll never get a self-driving car, but I'm saying they weren't there. The stepping stones weren't there in 2016. If you invest a huge amount of money and so forth at that point in time, you are looking at some serious risk and loss potentially, and people did. I mean, there were a whole self-driving divisions that were created and then later sold off because they didn't pay off, and it's because there was this false subjective narrative. There was the ignorance of the problem that the stepping stones have to be laid. It's like, could we have had computers in 1840 something instead of 1940 something? No, it'd be insane to launch a project like that at that time or could the space program have been in 1900? It's like, ""Well, these people were so great and so patriotic and so thoughtful. To launch this thing in the 1960s and they succeeded,"" but you're missing the fact that that would've been an idiotic insane thing to do in 1900. What was really genius about it was that this was something that was just timed perfectly when all the technology was available suddenly and it wasn't 10 years earlier. That is another thing is keeping an eye on the stepping stones. I think both are things that we can do, maximizing stepping stones and proliferating them intentionally based on interestingness, and also keeping an eye on when things snap into possibility that weren't before.",3310
73,Kenneth Stanley - Greatness Without Goals,Stepping Stones for Humanity," Patrick: It's fascinating to think about some of the general purpose stepping stones. I was listening to a review of Titan, the John Rockefeller biography, and you think about like whale oil for street lamps going to rock oil for kerosene, again, just for street lamps, and then all the things that it led to or the microchip or, I mean, all these things are really impossible to imagine where they go once they've been proliferated. It's pretty cool to think about searching for them. The skeptic in me thinks of, is sitting here replaying the scene from Apollo 13, which is great example of the famous phrase, ""Necessity is the mother of all invention and what is necessity, but an objective."" So in Apollo 13, you've got the guy saying, ""In order for these guys to breathe, we've got to fit this into this using nothing but this,"" and they solved the problem. So they've got a near-term objective. They don't know how to do it, so it meets our criteria and they fix it. You hear this over and over again like during war. All this stuff gets developed because it's required to win. So how do you think about that phrase, which seems to maybe throw a bit of a wrench in the works of our discussion, necessity being the mother of all invention? Ken: There's maybe two things. Obviously, the first thing is that sometimes when you're in a desperate situation, the stepping stones are there to do what you need to do. Patrick: You just become aware of them. Ken: It wasn't necessary to think of them. It's not just that there was this cool thing you could have done but you didn't think of it. It's like you really didn't need to think of it. There's no need to think of it. If there isn't some catastrophe on the space shuttle or something, then you don't need to think about being innovative about how to get oxygen. It's not a problem. The stepping stones are there, and we can do this. If they weren't there, forget it. It doesn't matter how many geniuses were in the room. I could use that, and that's part of it. That's where we get some of these narratives from because it's actually the stepping stones are there. So it's actually not that far down the horizon to get to these things. The other side is I think interestingness as a really important topic for us to get deeper into and address. When you think about something like war or the necessity of invention in war, I think what is happening that is still instructive there is that we recalibrate the things that we find interesting, depending on what's going on in the world around us. That is a valid thing to do. We understand during a war there are certain types of things that really matter. It's a whole rich tapestry of things. It's hard to even articulate exactly what those things are, but there's this large set of things that are related to war, helping people who have been injured related to destroying things, whatever it might be, which then just become more interesting than they were just because of necessity. It's not the same as having an objective, I think, and I think that we can focus on areas, artificial intelligence, for example, the fact that there's a lot of investment going into artificial intelligence right now, obviously, billions of dollars because we recognize it's really interesting. That's different to me. Although other people wouldn't interpret this way, but this is against the conventional interpretation, but to me, we're investing in the interestingness not the objective.Artificial intelligence is a far off goal like AGI. It's what people in the field would call it, artificial general intelligence, this human level, amazing machine or something. When I think about that, I think that is too many stepping stones away to realistically invest in. We have no idea what the stepping stones are that are going to be leading to AGI. It doesn't mean we'll never see them. We just don't know what they are yet. As an investment target from an objective perspective, I think it's not very principled, but it still makes sense to be interested in the area of AI, the view of AI and I am personally interested in it. So not hypocritical for me to say it, but the reason it's interesting is because it's pretty clear to me. If you look at things that are AI adjacent, things that relate to computers doing computations that have some alignment with what humans do in their own heads, there's millions of applications there that are just extremely valuable and interesting, and those are the next stepping stones in the chain. So opening those up is going to be cool, whether or not it leads to AGI this far off thing. By thinking that this is an important subject area, I'm actually refining my interestingness sense, and the interestingness sense is what we should be, I think, talking about in the context of what I'm saying leads to innovation because it's the thing that registers the stepping stones. It's like, ""How are you collecting this repertoire or this archive of stuff that you can jump off from?"" The archive gets more powerful the longer it runs, the more stepping stones we have. That's why from today, the year 2022, we can get to more places than we could in 1922 because our archive is more powerful.This word interesting is basically what explains the expansion of the archive and the registration of those stepping stones. It's like basically a publication event in Picbreeder. It's like when I discover something in Picbreeder that I think is worth sharing, basically what I'm saying is this is interesting. I think other people might care about this and then it's out there for other people to see. That is the point of connection, the point of collaboration that actually matters. It's not like an assessment by a committee. It's just airing it to the world. Everybody can look and decide for themselves this is a stepping stone, worth our soul. So what's actually happening that's in aggregate important is the exposure of those stepping stones across society. Society is diminished in its ability to innovate when stepping stone exposure is also diminished, which is ironic if you think about it. Our committees are basically designed to diminish the exposure to stepping stones. I send my proposal to the NSF. Some committee looks at it. They say, ""No."" Nobody hears about it ever again. It may be out of thousands or millions of people, one person would've seen this as interesting and it would've changed that person's life. This is not the design of how our society works at all, but what you have to understand is that these connections happen this way. It's one in a million type of things that one person sees the potential. No one else sees it before that person. A committee of five people is crazy in that case. Even if they're experts in the fields, whatever, they just basically represent the status quo. You need the person that's off there on the side who can see the potential. So I think what we should be thinking about is interestingness and what it actually means. Patrick: It's crazy to think about how this impacts the world, and there are examples of this. The idea of permissionless innovation or publishing is something that I think has been really important on the internet and the cost of experimentation, which we haven't talked about seems like a key variable. 30,000 generations is cheap for a computer. It's freaking expensive for a human. What you would want is to promote low cost and fast experimentation, and all these things I think have their proponents. What do you think this means about living an interesting life? It seems as though the anxiety associated with goals, at least from my personal experience, is that you said something you want, even if it's naïve like, ""I want more money,"" or whatever it is, ""I want the perfect spouse,"" all the things that I think we all say we have as objectives that you're just living this state of anxiety, horrible anxiety because you don't yet have the thing you want. Whereas I think you're proposing an alternative, which is literally every day you could say, ""I'm just going to compare my reference class, all my experience to the stuff I find today, optimize for novelty, try to proliferate that novelty or combine available stepping stones in interesting new ways, maybe I'm happy all the time."" What do you think this means for like our lives and our happiness even larger? Ken: I think it does apply to your individual life. To me, it's fascinating because it starts with experiments in artificial intelligence that are very dry and not in personal, in any way. This is about AI, but eventually, it seems like the insights here do extend, I think, profoundly. When I think about it, we do run our individual lives this way. I did agree with you. It's toxic, psychologically toxic, which is really interesting, isn't it? It does feel like something about society, something about all these goals, percolating through life. Patrick: We're attached to them, right? Ken: Yeah. It's just stifling over time. It seems to grip you from a really early age, from six or seven years old or something. You're just in this constant objective vice and you can't get out of it. It makes you sweat. I think it must be satisfying to hear an argument against that. Why would it be personally helpful to hear this algorithmic argument? It's probably because at some level we know that this is not natural. This isn't how the world works. That's why there's cognitive dissonance, I think, in life. It's so objective like Western culture, maybe more culture than Western culture. So many objectives pervading everything. We somehow, I think, at some deep instinctual level realize this is insane. It doesn't make any sense, and it's actually true. It's insane. It's not principled, whatsoever. Again, we have to concede that in some cases you want to lose weight or something. It can make sense to have the objectives. You don't want to eliminate all objective thinking from everything. In this self-discovery or ""What am I going to do with my life?"" type of stuff, I think that's analogous to blue sky discovery at a society level. You're trying to discover something that's meaningful to you. That includes even love or cliche things like that. It's like it does apply to those kinds of things. How am I going to find that thing, that thing that makes me satisfied? Is it even possible? What does it even mean to be like truly satisfied for your entire life? That's very blue sky. I think the stepping stones are totally unclear. Then of course, the same principles will apply and the same uneasiness will apply because you're like, ""Oh, but I have this whole plan for myself and I'm going to set an objective, and then what am I going to do? I'm going to have to be random."" Again, you don't have to worry about being random again. You can look at this as we just do things that are interesting, collect those stepping stones for yourself now. Those are individual stepping stones.You give yourself multiple opportunities and you use those as jumping off points to find what makes you satisfied, interested, rich, whatever it is that you're worried about, but there's a big caveat, which I think is very important at the individual level to acknowledge, which is that there's risk involved. Everything we've been talking about, this entire conversation involves risk, and it's very important I think when you're talking to individuals especially, but even at institutional. We have to acknowledge we're talking about taking risks. It's like having a portfolio, having a repertoire, having an archive of things. Some won't pay off, and it's very important at the individual level I think to understand. If this advice is appealing, you have to understand that what you're getting into is a system of taking risks. I mean, you're taking informed risks. So you understand the risks you're taking, but it's obviously true that if you follow a path because it's interesting, there's no guarantees of anything, whatsoever, and it could end up failing. You're doing this, hopefully, with the awareness that it might not pay off in the end and you think it's worth it. That's why you would do it. Not all interesting things turn out to work or to work out. That's why it's good to have a portfolio investment perspective, and some things will pay off, not all things. So it's good to have your own little portfolio of things you're pursuing, but even then, we should acknowledge that there's a legitimate approach to life, which is just to have modest aims, which is less risky. You should choose things for your life that make sense for you, and you're not obligated to take risks. If you do want to have a process of self-discovery or just discovery in general, do things that are really remarkable from your point of view, then you'll have to take risks. There's no choice. The whole idea of our interestingness, repertoire, stepping stones, it's all about risk. So you have to take risks in order to have amazing ends.",2855
74,Kenneth Stanley - Greatness Without Goals,The Effect of Constraints on Inventiveness," Patrick: The most alive I've ever felt is in these moments of creativity or discovery. I think everyone wants that. Even if they haven't had it, if they had it, they would want it from that point forward. The human ability to combine disparate parts into new combinations is the coolest thing in the world. It's driven our whole history, but it's also on a personal level, speaking from my own experience in the limited times I've combined anything and anything interesting, it's just the most alive that I've ever felt. I now wonder if you could talk a little bit about the role that constraints play in this. You and I talked about this great computer scientist, Brett Victor, and his notion of inventing on principle that rather than have an objective, you should instead focus on a means not an end that you believe deeply in. His is this one about how programmers should be connected to the output of their inputs, and you can watch a talk from him that's awesome that we'll link to. I wonder how you think about constraints. It seems as though constraints really play a key role in creative output. If we all had our own open-ended algorithm, I'll call it, of discovery that makes life worth living and make us feel so alive when we're discovering things, constraints is the last piece of this, I think, that's really important, and maybe even intentionally choosing your own constraints to live your life by. How do you think about constraints in the role that they play, even in something like evolution, which is survive and reproduce? Those are pretty powerful constraints that have led to insane outcomes. Ken: Constraints do play a role. It's very important that they play a role. If you don't have constraints, you are veering more towards randomness. Constraints are what make the collection of interesting stepping stones less random. It means that there's some principle that's still selected. The word interesting is very important, playing a big role here. It's a hard to define thing, which is intentional here because it's supposed to encompass everything that matters in life. This is very broad concept of what's interesting and it is different for you and me, but it's certainly a constrained concept. If you were a constrained, then you would archive things that are of no interest. You would be keeping around stepping stones that are basically insane and have no potential. So clearly, you have constraints, but what do these constraints mean, and what's a valid constraint? I think it's really good to point to evolution because we haven't done that yet, that evolution is an instructive example because natural evolution is an example of an open-ended process of stepping stone collection as well, an insanely powerful one, but it accounts for the emergence of all of living nature. That means every single creature that you see out your window is part of one search process, which is evolution, and there is clearly a constraint there. Actually, I should clarify. Why is it not objectively driven? People say, ""Oh, but it is objective. Survival of the fittest, it's an objective."" What I mean by non-objective here is that there isn't a creature that it's aiming for. The actual products, the concrete products of the process like a human, like a bird, like a plant photosynthesis, the birds represents flight, and human represents intelligence, you're going to get these all really important discoveries from a single process of discovery.None of them are the objective. None of them are written into the rules. If you just look at try to survive, you cannot predict bird. That is just impossible. So these are not objectives in the usual sense. I think that the survive and reproduce thing is constraint. It's a strict constraint. It means that basically it's a very weird constraint if you think about it. It's not usually said this way, but basically, you can just be a walking Xerox machine. In your stomach, there's a Xerox which can make a pretty good copy of you. That's a machine inside of you, and then the copy you make also has a machine inside of it. That's a pretty tough constraint. To build something that can make a copy of itself is crazily hard. Actually, I think that's what keeps the process honest in some sense, and that's why it doesn't devolve into just a bunch of inert blobs lying on the ground because it would if that wasn't required. Basically, imagine this is a thought experiment, but if you intervened in evolution and so that everybody gets to reproduce. We're not going to have constraints. So it doesn't matter what you have. We'll make a copy of you, some entity. This is a total thought experiment, but we'll just give you a child, even though you don't even have genital organs, we'll just give you a child, make one that's a little like you. Well, the world would devolve into all kinds of inert blobs covering the earth. The constraint is basically a way of keeping things interesting. That's actually what I think is really the explanation for why evolution works. It's not that it has targets like trying to create a brain. It's got a really hard constraint that everything has to be this complex machine. I think it was a Rube Goldberg machine generator. Every time you vary the Rube Goldberg machine, which is this crazy convoluted thing that makes a copy of itself, can you imagine Rube Goldberg machine that copies its own self into another Rube Goldberg machine? They're all going to be insanely complex and insanely functional forever, but they'll vary.They'll basically fill the space within that constraint of every possible thing you can imagine. There are going to be some interesting things in there because it's every possible way you can make a walking Xerox machine. You're going to see eventually it's going to fill the space.So it's the Rube Goldberg machine proliferation, the Rube Goldberg generator is basically the metaphor, I think. I would think of as what the constraint offers. It basically ensures that everything contains a level of complexity that keeps the potential going for the next generation of cool stuff to come out. You have to decide for yourself what that constraint is. It doesn't have to be a walking Xerox machine. I mean, that's evolution. For you, it's something else. Your constraints have to do with what you're interested in, but you have to keep it honest. If you put your standards down and you're not really keeping things interesting, then yeah, things will devolve towards the inherent blobs covering the earth. The constraints matter a lot, and they're what keep the stepping stones interesting. So the leading edge of pick breeder are things that look like stuff. They're not all, by the way. There's some things that are just really cool wallpaper pattern. So there's more to interestingness than meets the eye sometimes, but they're basically all really interesting stuff. Whatever your field is, you got to look at it from that perspective and just make sure that you understand what interesting is. I think you can. If it's a field that's your field, if you spend years and years in a field, you're qualified to understand what's interesting and that's different than having an objective. That's a constraint. Patrick: The constraint thing is so cool. Obviously, we can't prescribe them for people. They have to light on them themselves. I haven't even mentioned your interesting background where you built a business that was sold to Uber that became Uber's AI labs and then worked for open AI, and you've had this fascinating history in that world of ML and AI, which is so driven by objective outcomes that we're trying to accomplish. So it's interesting that there's been a lot of advances there just through raw compute, I think, that have driven some improvement, but how do you set this for yourself? I'm curious what your constraint is. How should we think about constraints in this world of AI when we have so much horsepower now and so much potential, but all of it seems trained on definable objectives? Where do you think this could go? If we open this up, what might happen? Ken: I think that to stay on the cutting edge of anything, it requires continually refining your sense of interestingness. It is I think for everybody, including me, a very complicated and a very exhausting process to really continually be sensitive to what's interesting because the thing is it changes over time because novelty is, of course, like you mentioned novelty, and I haven't mentioned it a lot here, but I often talk about it when I'm talking about this in the field of AI because novelty is an intrinsic aspect of interestingness. It's a very important factor in what's interesting. What is interesting is changing constantly. If you rest on your laurels and you think about what was interesting 20 years ago, and maybe you were really good at identifying those things, it's not going to be true 20 years later. That same heuristic will no longer apply because the world has moved on and that's no longer going to lead to novelty the way it did 20 years ago. I think this is why people fall off their game understandably and excusable, but it happens because it's just very tiring to keep up with really the cutting edge of interestingness, which is this ability to see where's the potential now as opposed to 20 years ago.Of course, being young is an advantage because you're coming up to this cutting edge for the first time. Everybody has their own heuristics, but I think I try to be rebellious. I tried to repudiate what I previously thought constantly to push myself in another direction. Yeah, that in a way keeps me from just getting into a comfortable corner that gets fully exploited. It's true that if you're really smart, you can find a little corner of the search space that is currently unoccupied. So it's full of low hanging fruit and you will get into that part of the search space and you will just prune everything quickly. You'll be famous after that, and then that'll look really good and you can live out your whole life based on that, but that little encounter with that part of the search space, and that's what often people do. They just find that area and then they're just comfortable there and they basically exploit it and then it's over, but it doesn't matter because they're world famous and rich by then, and there's no need to keep moving, but if you want to keep moving, you have to leave eventually. That's now a comfort zone. It's been exploited. The long hanging fruit has been picked and now you have to go somewhere else, and that's really tough, I think, because now you're famous for that little area. You don't want to leave. For myself, I try to just rebel against my own self, basically. I try to look at it like, ""Where would people predict if they were me they would go and then not go there?"" Patrick: I love that. That's great. Ken: ""What would the obvious thing for me to do next and then that probably what I should do?"" Patrick: Don't do that. Ken: Anyway, these are all just heuristics. There's no easy answer, obviously. The truth is in the richness, not in these simple rules of thumb. I have sensitivity to millions of dimensions of things that are just unique to my personality and so do you and everybody. You have to be honest with that and loyal to that, even when it repudiates you in those directions. Patrick: If you think about that novelty is so important and that novelty ultimately is about having a big reference class, to know what's new you need to know what's not new. Therefore, it seems like the superpowers are curiosity and exploration. Is that the boiled down final conclusion of all this work that you've done that fundamentally it's curiosity and exploration that drive it all? Ken: You could say that. In some sense, that suggests, well, there's nothing new here. I would maybe add deception. It's curiosity, exploration, the idea of deception, which is when you're moving towards something and things seem to be going well, often they're not, actually. These are old ideas. It's like we know about curiosity, exploration. Everybody loves those things, and deception is not a new idea. What have we learned over here? I would say at some level what you're saying is true that, yeah, this isn't new at all, but at another level, I think what is new is just the recognition, both that there is a horrible pathology because of deception. We don't recognize how pathological deception is. It's just absolutely pathological. Also, curiosity and exploration are principled, algorithmically principled. We often think of them as indulgent suits, I think. So the new thing is they're not indulgent suits. Their principled thing to do is to follow curiosity and explore. Somehow it's like you're cheating or you're off hours or something. Patrick: Wasting time. I've gotten that one a lot, ""What are you doing? You're wasting time."" Ken: It's my 20% time. This is where I get to do what I really want to do or something. It's really productive. That's completely upside down. Actually, this is the principled thing to do. Now, recall, we're talking about when you're doing blue sky discovery, it's not principled if you're just trying to lose weight or drive, for example. The last thing I would want is a driver who's exploring methods of driving. That's not the stuff you want to go on the road. You don't want exploration there. So it's not like all of life we should just be curious and exploring, ""Let's see what happens if I veer into another lane or something like that."" That's not always good, but yeah, if you're trying to do things that involve discovery, innovation, fulfilling yourself for your life, then this is actually principled. I think that is new for most people because it's thought of as such an indulgence. Patrick: Ken, I so appreciate the work you've done. I mean, for me, it's put in stark relief. Some ideas that I've been messing with for a long time that I could never really articulate, certainly not empirically, and you've done just that. I mean, I think everyone can benefit from watching talks you've given from reading the book, from challenging themselves that in the world of objectives, if there's an existing objective, the logical stuff has been tried and probably perfected. To me, it's exciting that if I'm going to do something interesting, just again, speaking selfishly, it's probably going to result from tinkering and exploration and disparate parts and an island of misfit ideas and all these cool things. I so appreciate the ideas you put out there and also your time today. I ask everybody the same traditional closing question. What is the kindest thing that anyone's ever done for you? Ken: Well, first, let me just thank you because I really appreciate being on this show. Also, I really had a great time at Capital Camp. Such a hard question, but I think I'll just cite my friend. His name was Ed, who gave me money to do research out of his personal bank account. That's a very unusual thing. He really affected my career. Usually, people in science, at least in academia, will get money from agencies or government or from a company or something. He's not related to me or anything. He just started to give money to our research. That was just amazing, the generosity there, and he kept giving more. He was very encouraging to me, almost like a father figure. He said I was going to be a great scientist, and I was like, ""Why are you doing this with your money?"" He actually unfortunately died. He was 68 years old and he had cancer. I always felt extremely grateful to him for helping me get started with my career. I actually gave my son's middle name Ed or Edward to recognize him. Patrick: It's incredible, and I think demands one last question. This idea that you've referenced over and over again that no one is telling people how they have to behave in something like pick breeder. There's a permissionless nature to it. There's a individuality and individual interpretation of events. With all that in mind, for those whether it's running a grant organization or running a labs, an AI labs or innovation labs inside of a company or anyone that has resources like Ed did that want to deploy those resources in service of disruption and innovation, either generative or protecting against it or whatever, you've already talked about what they do wrong. If you were in-charge of one of those, an allocator of resources to create innovation, how would you do it? Ken: I think if you're in a position like that, you're a gatekeeper. So you are responsible for the perpetuation or not of this objective culture. It's especially relevant if you're purportedly involved in fostering innovation because that's where this gatekeeper has a huge influence. Yeah. I would recommend doing things differently. You probably exist in their framework where that's very difficult because you answer to somebody. They don't understand where you suddenly say, ""Well, I'm not assessing things in this normal objective way anymore."" They're like, ""What the heck are you doing? How do we know this is working?"" So this takes some courage, I think. The first thing I would say, get the courage because there's nothing we can do about that. You have to explain to them, ""If we're not going to follow the usual security blanket rooted things, the people in the chain are going to have to be convinced and that's hard work."" That's why I think it's worth having a conversation like this show. That's why we wrote the book. It's like we wanted to start people having these conversations. So get the courage to have the conversations and really fight because it's not going to happen if you don't. You're just going to shut down. You're going to think, ""I want to do this, but, eh. On the other hand, my boss wants this. His boss wants that. There's a funding agency out there or we have investors."" You're like, ""Forget it. It's too complicated."" Somehow you got to fight this.Now, in terms of actually practical implementation, what should you do? What I would say is you should be maximizing stepping stones in the pursuit of innovation, not maximizing an objective performance. There's two things, maximizing stepping stones and maximizing exposure to stepping stones. The thing that makes innovation work is that the people who could run with something are exposed to the thing that they could run with, and that is what's missing I think from a lot of these organizations is that we have these filters, which are extremely narrow, which decide what comes through, and they end up pruning out things. It's the conversion consensus problem. Things don't get exposed to a person who would react dramatically if they were exposed to that thing. What we should do is greatly broaden the filters that go from idea to exposure to the people who could run with the ideas and then also change the criteria for what should be pursued. You have to recognize that if you pursue something that requires investment, so it costs money. So we're not talking about decisions that can be made lightly. Nobody can say, ""Well, everything will pursue because now we're all going to be open-minded. We're just going to do everything everybody wants."" That cannot happen. Some things have to not happen, but the way that we decide what happens, I think the criteria should be quite different.It should not be trying to move to consensus, get a committee to agree with something, get the most vote, something like that. It should be many people within the context of the organization, whatever many means. Many people are exposed to the ideas that are being generated, and that basically only one or two need to trigger the success of that idea or to say, ""This is worth investing,"" but then you say, ""Well, how can that be?"" Then every idea would have to be invested because somebody might want to invest in everything. The reason I think it can make sense is if there's skin in the game for the people who are validating the ideas. If I see something that is so exciting to me that I'm personally willing to pursue it that I didn't come up with myself, just like the alien face that led to the car in Picbreeder, then I'm actually willing to spend my time on what you did. I'm actually giving something away. I could have had that time. I could have invested in something else. What should make the confirmation of something meaningful and really worth investment is if the person who's confirming it is giving something away. Maybe they lose their right for some period of time to have their idea even considered or they give away the resources that they were giving for some project that they had. There's obviously finite resources, but if someone's willing to do that, that means that this thing means a lot to them, and it only takes one person, magic connection, electric connection to happen, and we have to somehow create those connections. It's not going to be consensus matter. It's going to be a niche thing. When there's something incredible, it's not going to be tons of people see, it's going to be one out of a hundred see it, and that has to be honored somehow. We have to find a way to do that. Patrick: What a great place to close. Ken, this has been so much fun. As always in our discussions, I learned a ton. Thank you so much for your time.

76,Lydia Jett - Investing in E-commerce,How Lydia Landed at SoftBank," Patrick: Lydia, I've been really looking forward to doing this with you for a few months now. I know we've moved it around once or twice. Maybe to begin, it would be helpful to just sort of introduce you to the audience. You've got a really interesting set of background and growth equity now with SoftBank. Maybe you could describe what has united every major career stop that you've had so far. Or another way of asking the question is what curiosity have you been pulling on thus far in your career? Lydia: First, thank you for having me. I started listening to this a couple years ago and have found it just to be incredibly informative as to how people think in the random walks we've been on. I'll address the question in terms of what linear path has driven where I am with a little bit more of an admission that's been a little bit of a random walk. I've spent my entire career in finance that was haphazard. I graduated from college knowing nothing and having no particular connections and really struggled to figure out how to land in a place that felt fulfilling. It took me a year post college to land. But I ended up at J.P. Morgan right in the back half of the last crisis back in 2002. And I felt really lucky to be there. I was on the capital market side of the business, focused on debt capital markets and really understanding capital structure and risk and how do companies optimize how they structure and fund their businesses. After a couple of years, I had the opportunity to go lean into the investing world and launched into investing in 2005 and have been here ever since.We spent about a decade focused on more private equity style investing that really is understanding the risk factors of the business, because fundamental growth of the underlying assets isn't big enough to support big misses relative to the debt that you have on the balance sheet. I take a step back and I look at that period of time and it was 100-page decks talking about all the potential risks that businesses might run into. And now we get comfortable that we have mediated those risks. In 2015, when I leapt over to join the SoftBank platform first as a member of the SoftBank group investing team which was seven of us launching the very first growth equity efforts. In many ways I felt like a wild place that I just couldn't understand. I'd had a decade teaching me that you had to be really disciplined and focused on downside. And all of a sudden, I ended up in an organization where you really had to do the opposite, which was just make sure that you had tailwinds driving your business and then identify the couple big things that had to go right to win. Then that transition took a while. I will admit, I think I called my husband my first night at SoftBank and I said, ""I'm not sure I can do this."" The methodology, the style of thinking's just so different from how I've grown up and where my head sits. Then over the last seven years at SoftBank, I've really been pulled in that direction and can see the beauty of the optimistic thinking and the identification of what really matters. Patrick: I love the idea of shifting from what could go wrong to what could go right. In the actual day to day process of those two different extremes, highlight for us the things that are most different. The brand itself in my mind is the sort of what could go right, make huge bets on massive potential outcomes even if some people are saying it's a little bit silly. And we'll get into what makes SoftBank so unique later, but what are the biggest felt differences for you of 10 years doing it one way, and now seven, eight years doing it the other way? Lydia: I just think there is such a crystallization of a couple things that really matter. And I'll never forget Masa really distilling the fact that it is tailwinds that fundamentally provide protection for businesses. So we should only ever be investing in businesses with tailwinds. So he's sort of iconic for talking about what are the big fundamental technology changes. Those are tailwinds we're talking about. We spend a lot of time talking about market position and what sustains market position. It's why I've spent a lot of my career thinking about how do you actually define a moat and what does that look like around a business. How do you keep your market position in a volatile changing market with a lot of cash around you? And this has not always been something we've been great at, but we're making sure that we are funding business models that are fundamentally improving through automation and technology, as opposed to just decaying the economic curve of what businesses have been on. I think a lot about FinTech or the financial services industry is one where you've just had a big, broad decay of fee streams into these organizations, which is what technology has brought. I've tried to focus a little bit more on making sure that companies can actually extract some of the economics to their own balance sheet as opposed to passing it all back to customers. So I bucketed into the three things. Are you on the curve of growth, have you identified your position in market, and are you fundamentally improving your business model over time are the three areas that I spend a lot of time on in sort of broad abstract terms. Patrick: How do you learn about tailwinds? I guess I'm curious what you think the predominant tailwinds are today that maybe even specifically the businesses you're involved with are riding. But even more generally, like if you're looking at a business today, what are the major tailwinds that you think are sustainable? I'd love to go a little bit deeper on each of these three dimensions starting with tailwinds. Lydia: At SoftBank, I've really focused my career on e-commerce because I fundamentally believe that it is a beautiful economic flywheel that the consumer globally today is not well served by a really fragmented long tail of offline retail, and that the economic pact we're making with each other that we are transitioning into an online world does drive great efficiencies. Now, how do I think about getting more product to consumers and longer tail of skews at a lower set of prices? I think Masa has historically really been very focused on technology improving efficiency and therefore driving down the total cost of producing goods. The economic impact has certainly equated enterprise value as we've seen across the technology sector. When we spent time over the years debating whether or not we should be investing in companies at valuations in countries that didn't have public market cap that would support those valuations, we kept coming back to although there are no companies bigger than banks and mineral companies today. But we do believe the transition of value will be clear because the consumer benefit is so much greater. We're willing to make those fundamental bets that the technology companies should be bigger than what we've seen in traditional industry before. Patrick: How far along do you think that e-commerce transition is? I'm especially interested maybe by geography and where you think the biggest remaining opportunities are, because it seems like obviously it's a huge trend. There are huge businesses in the category of some of the best known companies in the world, I want to dig into competitive dynamics. But how far along is this transition? How much room left to go is there? Lydia: I tend to be very, very bullish on this topic. It is incredibly dependent on the specific economies that we operate in. When I first started working on e-commerce assets at SoftBank, I had this really naive perspective that you could just take models that worked in the US or in China, and you'd transplant them to India or Korea, Indonesia, and you'd see very similar curves. I realized really quickly the obvious statement I'm about to make, which is that countries are very different from each other and are driven by different factors. I think we can all agree that we expect upward penetration to continue even though their rates are dramatically different today. If you look at China or US which have very meaningful penetration today. Korea comes up next. India, Indonesia, very low on the list. Russia, very low on the list. Across the board, I do believe the economic benefit to the consumer is significant enough. It should continue to drive penetration. There's lots of different factors that overlay into this. I look at Korea as a very under retailed geography. I look at the US as one where we have big dispersion across big geographic swaths of land and have very different experiences in terms of access to goods. I think that the question to me is not are we done, but how much more value can we continue to add. I don't see a stopping point realistically. Now I don't think you see traditional retailers seeing a stopping point. Walmart was actually one of my first customers when I started my career in banking. It was the first corporate I worked with. They were the big fundamental retailer that was innovating around the box structure. But it's really exciting to see how much they're doing today in terms of thinking about how do they bring digital to a customer base. I think we're so far away from our conclusion here to be precise about it as sort of impossible for anyone to do with any confidence.",1981
77,Lydia Jett - Investing in E-commerce,The Competitive Frontiers in E-Commerce," Patrick: Eric Vishria at Benchmark has this beautiful idea of what he calls a competitive frontier. So for any given industry, there're being a couple variables or battlefields, however you want to think about it, that sort of determine or sort winners from losers in a certain space. What do you think the competitive frontiers are today in e-commerce as sort of variables on which one firm will beat another? Lydia: Experience has been the very obvious one. It is really hard to compete against speed. I think that is generally true across every region I look at. But I think if you start to dive down into micro levels, there are economies which are much more value driven. I would argue India, Indonesia have been much more value driven. I think it's one of the beautiful aspects of e-commerce that I've seen evolve over the last couple years as we've started to bring in much lower cost assortment into geographies. So how do you actually bring down that cost for customers and allow a higher quality of living? I think the really obvious ones that we've seen have been speed, they've been cost of product. And those have been big curves that have compacted very fast. It's hard to build these operationally intensive businesses where you're repeating pretty rote actions, millions, if not billions of times in a specific year. We are very thoughtful about the fact that we're not trying to overengineer the complexity of what we're doing, but how do you strip it down to a very base level to make sure that we're really nailing that customer value proposition from speed as well as increased value on assortment. Patrick: And maybe what's behind speed? If you just focus on that dimension, what drives those that are faster? Why are they faster? Lydia: I think that is very dependent on markets that you sit in specifically. In economies like the United States, you have an established set of supply chain operators. You've got your FedEx and your UPS, your USPS to provide a lot of last mile. You have your 3PLs which do a lot of the fulfillment for your long tail e-commerce assets. The question that we have been asking is how do you start to integrate more of that supply chain and drive through technology in a way that can just shave some of the handover between these separate operators, can shave time off a transaction. I think our best example of that has been Korea where you have a fully integrated supply chain in the context of Coupang. You have the same very similar setup in India with Flipkart and with Amazon India. You don't yet have that in the United States. You don't have it to the same degree in other established economies that have more traditional existing footprints already standing up. Patrick: Speed is a fascinating one. It's like hard to argue that it's an advantage. And it seems to have been one of the key advantages for technology companies in general. Alex Rampell has this great idea of sources incumbents being about whether the startup can achieve scale and distribution before the incumbent can achieve innovation, who can surpass the other one faster. In what areas do you think there is the most innovation today then in e-commerce? I guess I've been conditioned to just think like in Amazonian terms, better, cheaper, faster are the dimensions that matter of online retail. What do you think the areas that the most innovative companies are focused on? Lydia: There's no question that that's right and it has provided the model for the rest of the world in terms of how we think about what matters. But I do think excitingly for all of us, what we saw in the pandemic was Amazon not capable of fulfilling that promise that they've been really good at fulfilling. It provided a really nice opportunity for others to step in and make significant investments. I was listening to your interview with Tobi from Shopify recently, and thinking about the investment he's made and trying to be that full stack provider to e-commerce suppliers. Walmart stepping in and thinking about how do they use their fulfillment differently. I think this is a less obvious point in time that Amazon is going to be everything to everyone. I think it is a more interesting time to think about how you can innovate. I think one of those areas we've been watching really closely and I still sit somewhat on the fence on is live and social commerce innovation that's happening across the Eastern world. I think there's very explicit reasons why that has been so powerful. I think there is a lack of the high quality physical retail and there's a lack of trust with existing brands. I think there's a culture of people selling to you in markets that we don't have in the US. So maybe we can suggest all of those things are reasons why live shopping won't come to the US. But on the flip side, I think there is really no question that the engagement levels are much, much higher with video based content. And so we see that in platforms like TikTok, they have just taken off like wildfire. You see that with a younger generation that really prefers to consume content in that video based format.We recently made an investment in a company called Firework because we believe that there will be a significant transference to video as the format of consumption for commerce in the US. We haven't seen it in meaningful scale yet. We've been watching very closely for it. What we do see when we look at the underlying customers that firework works with is just a big ramp in conversion factor relative to existing websites. And so what does Firework do? With any individual company anywhere from the PGA, to Muji the Japanese retailer, to your grocer, they allow these partners to integrate video very easily and quickly and affordably into their stack, whether it's web or out based. The conversion rates that we're seeing are significant multiple of what they're seeing for the non-video based purchasing. Do I think we're going to see the incredible velocity of video commerce in the US that you've seen in China? Not to the same degree. I don't think they're forcing factors are the same. But I am really excited about the fact that there is a lot of optimization to come when it comes to conversion and engagement, particularly in this point in time where Apple's security changes and Google security changes are impairing a customer relationship. I'm really excited that we'll be able to make up a lot of that last round and surpass it from a conversion level when we introduce video.",1389
78,Lydia Jett - Investing in E-commerce,Selecting For Great Management and Other Models That Work," Patrick: Are there unique characteristics or attributes of people leading these kinds of businesses relative to all the categories that you've invested in through your career? But if you just think kind of generally of the prototypical qualities of a great CEO, are the things in commerce specifically that you over select for when considering the founder or management teams? Lydia: I've been thinking a lot about SoftBank and the founders that we tend to back. I have a pretty myopic view. I do our consumer e-commerce investments as opposed to across biotech and enterprise and other categories. But in my world, we certainly do have a bent to a founder that more often than not is an immigrant, does have a wider world view, perhaps has actually come from China or India and has a more natural tendency to look outward and look at innovation. If you look at the list of companies that we've backed over the last couple years, it has been a really international cohort of people who are very curious about different trends around the world and trying to think about how to model them to our home country here in the US. Patrick: If you had to send some Western investor you cared about, an American investor let's say, to one country to have their socks blown off, where would you send them? Lydia: It would be hard to argue any place other than China to have your socks blown off. I'm constantly thinking about what a gift it was to join this wild organization in 2015, 2016 time period when the US investor base was really myopically focused on Silicon Valley. That wasn't that long ago, and yet it was pretty strange to be spending time internationally. I think the thing that knocked my socks off was just the scale and velocity of company build that happened in China. When I joined in 2015, we really didn't have a China strategy. We believed that we would accrue the value of China through our position in Alibaba. And we thought between Alibaba, Baidu, and Tencent. That would be most of the Chinese technology market. And man, were we wrong. And so it has been really fun to just watch the scale of innovation on a consumer side stand up. There are so many examples of how different, the scale of ambition and the velocity of build is over in China. I think obviously the last year has been very complex and hairy and has caused a lot of investors to rethink their thesis there. But I do think it is a really beautiful testing ground for really turning everything you now upside down. Patrick: Maybe give an example of upside down. I know there's lots of examples here. And I'm also curious what barriers there are to life shopping, or whatever the example is, not getting to Western hemisphere for some of reasons. What are those things that are most upside down that they've tried that's worked that we haven't done? Lydia: I'll never forget actually heading to Indonesia in 2015. I was working with a colleague at SoftBank who had a product background and he looked at the app this Indonesian e-commerce company was operating. And he said, ""Man, that's a mess. How messy it is. It's so distracting. It's so cluttered."" And he's right. From an American perspective, I think we have really veered to a very clean UI in terms of what we build in the US. You've seen the exact opposite in China, in Indonesia, in India. You've seen countries really establish a consumer preference in a single landing page that offers them all of the consumer services that we might in the US fill our homepage with. So I do think there's a very different aesthetic that was way too easy for us to suggest was the right way. Maybe right for our culture, not right for other cultures, but I think it's a really stark example of just how different these countries are in terms of consumer preferences. Patrick: As you're focused on consumer e-commerce online sounds specific, but I know there's lots of subcategories, what subcategories do you spend the most time in? And maybe this harkens back to the tailwind question specific to this area. What are those sort of sub sector, subcategories, whatever you want to call them, that you find yourself most drawn to or spending the most time on today in 2022? Lydia: I'll just flip back to 2021 because that wasn't that long ago. We spent a lot of time thinking about the least penetrative categories of commerce. I think this wasn't terribly different from a bunch of the crossover investors who have historically looked at the world in a much more top down macro oriented way. We really looked at food and said we feel like this is an area that has meaningfully taken off in other parts of the world, where the economics of the businesses have been proven in other parts of the world, where we have figured out hybrid, if not fully digital approaches to food in the US. We've really only done that in the construct of prepared food delivery, i.e., DoorDash or Uber Eats. So we spend a lot of time in 2021 trying to think about how will food consumption and purchasing change in the new forward 10 year economy. We spent a fair amount of time trying to think about e-commerce enablement. I think because we have such strong established high quality retailers because we have such dominant online retail platforms in the US, we haven't really seen as much innovation trying to figure out how do we actually get that next layer of providers in front of customers. We spent a fair amount of time thinking about how do we support innovation, whether that is through helping bring best NextGen, best breed tools to e-commerce companies to reach customers. So companies like fabric or Firework as I mentioned earlier.And we spent a fair amount of time thinking about healthcare. I think that's a complicated one for me. My parents are actually in the medical field and I grew up believing healthcare was really complicated and ugly. The incentive systems aren't logical in any rational way. There's not only regulation of course, but there are payer provider dynamics that are just messy and hard to find our way around. So we tried to stay away from that payer provider relationship and think about how do we actually solve fundamental based needs like loneliness in this country. And then we spent a fair amount of time thinking about, is there a new creator economy being scaled by technology that we could participate in? There's a lot of buzz around the concept of a creator economy. There are a lot of companies that have been funded, but I think the big question for us is, is there an economic model that supports a really long tail fragmented set of creators in an exciting way? And we ended up making a pretty significant investment in that category as well. Patrick: Say a bit more about the models that maybe don't work that you've encountered there. I think there's been lots of, I don't mean to go from that phrasing of the question to an example which is Substack, but this idea of providing a platform toolkit that monetizes by taking a percentage of the commerce that's enabled in much the same way that a volume based payments company or Shopify or someone else might participate in the upside of what it enables. I'm just so interested by these kind of relatively low permission or permissionless creator models that monetize and align their success with the success of the creator, the limits to that, do they graduate from that. All the lessons here would be so interesting because it seems like literally everyone wants their version of whatever it is that they're building in e-commerce shop, a content property, whatever. Everyone wants to do this, even very established people. So what have you learned about those business models? Lydia: I think it's another great example of something in which we are very much trailing the east. There are large companies in China in particular in Southeast Asia that have really been set up to accommodate providing customers with the trust that they need in brands. And so just taking a big step back, we in the United States have brands that we trust. You trust the retailer that you shop from because you know returns will be processed. You trust the brand that you purchase from because you know the quality of goods will be high. There are celebrities and trusted individuals in America that can stand up and speak to product quality and have for a long time. What we saw developing across Asia, which was a very different model, was this long tail of influencers. It was effectively taking people who were just good at sales and putting them in front of consumers with product to authentically speak about the quality of that product. So for a long time, we looked for this in the United States and really struggled to find scaled business models because there are structural reasons why I think it is a little bit less relevant in the US. Where we ultimately got very excited was finding a large scale platform that not only provides the economic wherewithal for creators to build a real business out of utilizing their voice, but also as a very significant partner to some of the biggest retailers in the country.We invested in a company called LTK or LIKEtoKNOW.it, which is very under the radar Texas based company founded by a creator herself and her husband. Then they have become some of the biggest distribution partners to retailers like Nordstrom's, big partners to Walmart, big partners to big retailers who are fundamentally thinking about how do we in a more authentic, trusted way reach a new consumer base. I actually think it's been the pairing of both those models, the model that you mentioned at the beginning, which is how do you take a small cut, very small cut, almost the infrastructure layer like FinTech assets have established, from creators that allows them to build their own small businesses become economically viable on their own, but to also be a distribution partner to retailers in a way that provides advertising budget as well to work with. It's through matching both sides that we've found an economic model that we're very excited about. Patrick: Does that functionally turn into or start as a marketplace? Can I think about this if I'm Nordstrom let's say, that I get to go to this marketplace and sort of pick and sort through a number of people that I might want to have these partnerships with and then I rely on them to do it in whatever channel they do it in? Is that kind of conceptually right. Lydia: When I started my career, the media outlets in America were pretty consolidated. It was your traditional offline TV, terrestrial radio. You had big consolidated breach that maybe is myopically as could get down to a city level through some sort of regional network. What these new networks allow is for you to actually quantify and qualify what you're looking for in the influence you work with. These networks allow you to come to LTK and say, ""I'm looking for a voice from the south, someone in this age, a set of parameters, someone of this demographic."" Looking for that individual who really resonate to a specific audience base. They will then work with those influencers to get their product in front of that influencer's own owned base of consumers. And so those own bases of consumers of course come through big social platforms, but also reside on the LTK app as well. Patrick: For some reason, Cameo is popping to mind of something sort of as an analog. Obviously it's producing something very different. Is that roughly what it feels like? Cameo's challenge of course is to sign up great supply over and over again. Is that conceptually a useful analog? Lydia: I think it's a really interesting analog. Now, Cameo of course is a one to one model to my understanding where they're producing content on a singular basis for a singular fan that has purchased it. The question we keep coming back to for scalability is how do you reach a broader audience than a one to one model, where in LTK you are that influencer is speaking to their entire network of audience. I think similar but slightly different in terms of less targeted on individual basis. Patrick: What should Western investors know and understand about Coupang? Lydia: It's such an interesting reflection as I look back at the course of our time with Coupang. When I got involved with Coupang, we had just sold Flipkart to Walmart and that journey had been taken to an end much faster than I anticipated, but I learned how much I really loved that model of owning the entire customer experience in a way that previously had not been shown by competitors in market. When I spent time with Coupang, they'd actually met a lot of Western investors. And I think most Western investors had passed on the opportunity with the fundamental belief that Korea just wasn't big enough. It's why you see Coupang today talking about how big Korea is because they had heard, they'd learned over and over that's what Western investors care about. Western investors also tend to look at a pretty developed economy where you have meaningful commerce penetration, e-commerce penetration, and you have some large conglomerate and large retailers. But my experience with Coupang was just this beautiful unwrapping of all of the nuances why Korea doesn't look the way Western investors expect them to look like. So the big offline retailers aren't retailers in the form of a Walmart.They're not making one people purchasing with purchasing power and long assortment. They're more like real estate companies that are leasing space to small merchants. You have a really under retailed economy with a very limited skew count with very high prices, which is almost just a perfect setup for e-commerce. I believe that Korea and e-commerce penetration should be higher than it will be in other parts of the world because the offline experience is not sufficient to support a competitive product. Then you turn to the online world and there are a handful of e-commerce marketplaces that look akin to an eBay in terms of the experience where it is a long tail of assortment listed by merchants and they don't handle the fulfillment experience. That is fundamentally a subpar experience to a fully owned channel like Coupang has built and invested and developed in. They developed for a large number of years. I'm a believer that I think this company will continue to compound market share because it is offering much faster speed with much larger assortment with better pricing than I think Western companies experienced as they look at other economies around the world and try and pattern match, which is what we're all trying to do.",3120
79,Lydia Jett - Investing in E-commerce,Vertical Integration and Margins," Patrick: Can you tell me everything you've learned about vertical integration in this world. Because it's just so interesting that we're talking to Tobi recently at Shopify about a Shopify fulfillment network, which is obviously just like a crazy hard thing to build. And we talked about how hard it was to build, but that almost it's an imperative. If ultimately you're serving merchants and enabling commerce, you kind of have to control maybe down to the person that's dropping the package at the front door if you really want to make it better. And it just seems like a lot of the... There's Coupang, Amazon now, Shopify. Some of these monsters are all realizing that more and more vertical integration might make sense. What have you learned about all of this? Because it affects the business model, it affects margins. I just love to hear your lessons. Lydia: The vertical integration that Coupang has pulled off. I put it that way because this is not an organic build that I think could have... It, of course, was an organic build, but one that was prefunded very significantly by SoftBank. We had $3 billion of capital put into the ground on the thesis that it was the right thesis and it was worth making that upfront capital investment into it. I don't think you can do it successfully unless you throw all of your attention and focus as an organization against it, because it is so hard to do. I think we're going to see a lot of examples of companies in the Western world where they are building fulfillment and logistic networks from the ground up, but haven't figured out the efficiency required to operate them. And that is something that Coupang is just exceptional at. They really drive towards efficiency first before they scale, as opposed to scale and then try and figure out how to push efficiency through a big organization, which is next to impossible. I think the benefits of that vertical integration are exceptionally clear because it has allowed them to be very creative and innovative in terms of how they think about utilizing the advantage they have. We like to talk about some pretty simple advantages, but how do you rethink packaging in a way that increases density that you can get into the form factor of a van?How do you eliminate the context of needing boxes? How do you think about a returns network? I think these are all really interesting applications that continue to improve density and therefore economics of your business that require just an explicit focus on rethinking aspects of your business. That's very hard to do when you're not spending your full attention focused on it. As we have been trying to think about how do we mimic some of the examples of that in the US, we have found it really hard to do if we're focused on a specific point, if we're focused on just last mile delivery, if we're focused on just sortation, if we're focused on just fulfillment. It really is that integration that allows you to rethink form factor, it allows you to rethink experience that is pretty radically different. And that just requires a big capital efficiency and a big capital investment both at the same time. Patrick: What's everything that you care about or have learned about? And this could be gross margins, it could be operating margin. I don't really care. It just seems like margins is such a key component of a successfully scaled up e-commerce business. What have you learned about margins? Lydia: I actually love this pivot that we're in now from a market that was focused on growth to one that's focused on margin because I think we have made a mistake, those of us in capital provider seats, over the last handful of years in focusing companies too much on revenue growth. Because in that process, you end up building large companies that are very inefficient and it is incredibly hard to move backwards and improve margins from there. It just requires too much of a cultural shift. It requires a personnel shift. Just take a step back and think about how do we orient ourself with these operationally intensive businesses. It is first and foremost, can we prove out margins on small scale? So can we prove it out in a specific geography? Can we prove it out against one specific customer? What does that margin base look like? Because fundamentally, it should only get better from there as opposed to worse. I think when we look at businesses and we say the economics don't make sense today, but we can improve them by layering on adjacencies and other services, we're setting ourselves up structurally for a lot of pain. We have to prove out that core business model works. And that's where we spend a lot of time looking at contribution margin. Patrick: Not just in e-commerce, but in just so many businesses is you hear this thing of, ""When we get to X or Y our margins will be Z."" Well, the whole strategy is we're going to mature into higher margins. And then very often that just doesn't happen, or it takes longer, or they don't quite get to where they were projected. And sort of the whole investment decision was riding on this steady state eventual margins. How do you evaluate a younger company and it's potential to drive margins, understanding that they're going to be worse at the beginning and they're going to get better over time? How do you even begin to wrap your head around how something might work even if it's really young company? Lydia: Maybe I would ask, does anything ever happen unintentionally? Just as a starting point, I could give you a large number of companies, arguably all of the companies we've invested in where we have had to improve margins over time, where the fundamental unlock came through improving margins. And I am a believer that with scale amassed, you have more power to extract margins, that sort of undeniable truth that that should be true. The question is, how do you make that true? We have had to make big bets. I think Coupang was a very obvious big bet, Flipkart was a very obvious big bet of companies where the unit economics were not positive at our time of investment. And we had to believe the operating efficiency would get better to support positive unit economics. And I think what we were ultimately surprised by, and maybe this is obvious in retrospect, as you amass scale, your negotiating power gets better in combination with the operational efficiencies which are core to the heart and lifeblood of these companies has actually been a bigger lever in getting that unit economics positive position that you need to be in. This is a funny job because you are making bets about things that do not exist today. Generally speaking, I find myself getting irritated when people say they look for big TAM, I can't even think of a big consumer company that had a big established TAM when it got started. It doesn't logically make sense. If there was a big TAM, somebody would've eaten it.I look at the great list of consumer companies around the world. They all lived the experience of investors telling them that TAM was too small. I think the question that we spend a lot more time thinking about is, what would have to be true? What levers do you have to be able to pull to either improve a customer experience by a factor of five or 10 times? Because a consumer isn't going to stick with you because you're marginally better. So how do you make it significantly better? Or how do you meaningfully change the economic value proposition? Think about those two factors in the, what do you have to believe landscape of what really matters back to where we started this conversation. Those are the big bets that we end up making and then tracking very closely. But I will tell you, in every great investment, the underlying drivers and how they have operated have not mapped to the forecast that we built at investment. We've been surprised in every case. Patrick: I love the example you gave of the van and how that could drive weird efficiencies of package sizing or things like that. What is the most extreme or insane version of an efficiency game or pick up that you've seen any company employ in your history? Lydia: I like to frame these in terms of, when you look at a P&L and you look at unit economics, which was something we spend a lot of time looking at, we think about what are the really big buckets in any particular set of unit economics, which is basically your P&L stripped down to a unit basis. If you asked me what is the most extreme pickup I've ever seen, it has been in extracting further margin on product. It's just negotiating leverage when you gain scale. That's because the businesses I work with fundamentally, their COGS end up being the majority of their cost structure. The second level efficiencies are always those operating efficiencies of how do we actually take a dramatically unit economics negative business, because we are subscale in six regions that we have determined to have the ultimate ability to become scalable. And we've decided these are our six hubs that we've got to get to scale. And then we're going to rationalize along the way.I think those wins are very hard fought because they're on a unit level. It's every day you're dealing with the crisis of human capital, of inflation, of not having people show up to work with COVID. You're dealing with these crises every day. And so they're not the big needle movers that negotiating a new contract is a big immediate needle mover. In my world, there are actually very few things that kind of blow your mind because something happened. It is the cost, the hard one cost of every day getting incrementally better in very small ways and then getting to look back at a 48 month period and say, ""Wow, look at how radically different my business is than it was."" But I don't know that they'll blow your mind in terms of the unit variables.",2106
80,Lydia Jett - Investing in E-commerce,Realizing The SoftBank Vision," Patrick: Having talked to a lot of founders that have met with SoftBank and even with Masa specifically, one thing you always hear is, or a consistent piece of feedback for companies SoftBank invested in and didn't is, you're not thinking big enough. It's such a fascinating thing because usually these companies are thinking pretty big and moving pretty fast. And I know this again harkens back to the tailwind concept, but is the external perception of SoftBank, which I would sort of sum up by that, think bigger, think longer, think more, is that right? Is that brand that sort of slides that sometimes people make fun of Masa for putting up which are overly simplistic and often hilarious and the golden gooseling, the golden eggs or something like this? How much does that square with reality inside of SoftBank versus being sort of an oversimplified take on something much more nuanced inside? Lydia: The first thing I'd say is I've had the advantage of working on three different investment platforms and have been in this world for a very long time. There are so many ways to build a great company, and SoftBank is just not the right fit for the vast majority of companies. And I don't think venture capital necessarily makes sense for the vast majority of companies. So knowing who you are and what you're targeting and having a clear visual of who you want to be is important because once you jump on this venture capital ride and once you jump on a SoftBank ride, you're committing to something very different. You're narrowing your set of options. I do think that perspective is broadly speaking right.I think that Masa has this incredible ability to clarify and to boil things down to a very base level. And that's why we all get to kind of chuckle when we look at the slides because they're so simplified. The thesis is right. He really believes in an aggressive style of build. One that moves faster than other traditional sources might tell you to move. That's obviously not going to work for every business. It's not going to work for every business that we've built, but I think it is instinctually aligned with how do we generate returns as a fund. And you can't build a fund of this diversified set of companies without believing that you're going to generate more than two to three times return on each individual company. It very much is core to how he has built his own business in terms of enormous ambition and aggressive style of build, but also in terms of how do we think about driving returns for LPs? Patrick: Well, one of the things I saw you talk about, and I think it was like a 2018 interview, something around then, you made this reference to maybe having a $6 billion pool of capital and then that became $100 billion dollar pool of capital. I'm sort of staggering to think about deploying that much money into companies that are relatively young. Just tell me what you've learned about that size. The pros, the cons. The cynic would say you can't possibly deploy that much money at high rates of return in young companies. Obviously, you just outlined why it's a very specific kind of company that becomes a SoftBank back company. What role does size of assets, does raw assets play, in your life relative to your expectations coming into SoftBank? Lydia: First thing I'd say is we've learned a lot. I've lived in three pretty explicitly different SoftBanks. I lived in SoftBank Group before the Vision Fund was started. And our strategy was actually much the same as it was for Vision Fund 1. Let's just establish clear market leaders and let's aggressively capitalize them to continue their pace. In Vision Fund 1, we were writing $1 billion checks into companies. We were just writing them very, very infrequently. I think our asset selection was probably pretty good then. I think it was astonishing to the outside world to understand how you could put a billion dollars into a company. Just astonishing. When we launched Vision Fund 1 and had $100 billion, it allowed us to continue the same strategy but increase the velocity of the number of companies that we were investing in. And I think that just... I don't know if that terrified people or made people want to laugh until they couldn't laugh any further. There was a fundamental belief that probably by the way is largely correct. Too much capital causes a lack of discipline, which causes fragile businesses. It causes bloat. It causes a lack of focus that keeps you from reaching the end of your journey. There were so many lessons learned by the entire technology investor ecosystem over a long period of time that supported that you couldn't put this much capital to work in the technology industry. And Vision Fund 1 was really hard for people to comprehend. In Vision Fund 1, we backed north of 80 companies and had an average check size of $600 million. And I just don't think that the world understood at that point in time that companies could absorb this much money. We can talk later about absorbing it smart, but I think just can companies take that much money? I think what was really astonishing to see for me almost the watershed moment was when Ant Financial raised $14 billion back in 2018. That was the first time I'd seen a list of investors that was more than a page long who could write a $200 million check. That really didn't exist in '16, '17 when we launched the Vision Fund.So the worlds got really excited by the concept of technology being bigger than we thought it would ever be and being able to put this much capital to work. And I think a lot of different factions got excited to put money to work. You had the crossover funds start to come to being public markets oriented investors who started to go into the private world. You had corporate investors, you had LPs, you had the launch of individual investors and syndicates and SPVs felt like everyone was coming into this market. The last couple years have basically been the Vision Fund in distributed form, meaning we were all playing what Vision Fund 1 did together, but with hundreds of players around the world. What were my lessons from that period of time over the last seven years? There have been so many lessons and I hope that we're all paying attention and we're all learning and listening along the way. It is really hard to put a check of that size into an early stage company. There are just so few companies that are set up to absorb and smartly deployed. I think the original instinct is to just go as fast as you can to think about expansion, but the core reality is smart capital allocation matters a lot, and it's really hard to do that if you haven't even built up a strategic finance function within inside, within the business that doesn't partnered with the CEO. As I look back at Vision Fund 1, there were many instances of companies that were over capitalized and therefore weren't good deployers of capital. I think we learned that it's really hard to put debt on the balance sheet of a fast growing early stage business. Their businesses are still too volatile. And to ask them to subscribe to a set of covenants most likely is going to put you in a situation where you have a default on your side. We learned about asset heavy businesses or capital consumptive businesses. When we launched Vision Fund 1, we asked ourselves the question historically ventures never been able to fund capital consumptive businesses, but why not? Look how much money we have. Should we test the laws of physics on that? So we backed some companies that were very capital intensive and realized really quickly without very strong operational controls, it is a beautiful way to consume a lot of capital fast.And I think in retrospect, so many of these lessons are very obvious. I think we did feel the need to test the bounds of what was right because a market was constrained, versus what is just fundamentally right. And hopefully we've learned a lot of lessons. I do think a lot of our investments were very spot on. We've talked a little bit about Coupang and about the fact you couldn't build that business unless you were willing to prefund an equity, the entire infrastructure build that no bank would touch. We haven't talked about Fanatics, which was one of our first investments in the Vision Fund where we put almost $900 million into the company. And that is an extraordinary mature management team that has built an extraordinary set of assets and a real moat around that business. There is a long list of companies that have been very strong performers. I think that is a validation of a lot of the core strategy. It's important to talk about the mistakes. It's important to talk about what we got wrong and try and figure out how not to replicate it. I think maybe that's more important than talking about what we got right in the sense, but I do think a lot of things we did get right. And they were fundamentally questions about how do we attack industries with capital that people have written off either because the market is too small, the TAM is too small. How do we get the structural things right and make sure we have a disciplined enough team that we're really thinking smartly about capital allocation with that capital? Patrick: You said something earlier that was so interesting, which is that a common mistake is building the scale and then trying to drive efficiency when it should be the other way around. Is that the cleanest way to sum up the lesson of digesting that much capital? That you need to focus on efficiency first and smart capital allocation first, and then go for scale, versus if you're Uber, trying to open every city all at once before perfecting the model of a city to city? Is that kind of like the core lesson do you think? Lydia: I think Uber is an extraordinary example that it's going to be very, very hard to replicate. People love to use examples of Uber or Alibaba or Amazon, but the reality is, it's a very special set of circumstances in time that allow to build those companies. And in a market, a wash in capital, it's just a different environment than Alibaba was in or Amazon was in, than Uber was in at their orientation or their launch. So I have seen so many companies get big before they have figured out operational discipline and then realize too late that there is just no time to course correct. I really am a believer that you need to invest as a founder. You need to invest in a really smart, financially oriented right hand person who can help you see around corners on that capital allocation, who can help you understand your balance sheet. So often as I sit around board meetings with founders who are these beautiful visionary optimist surrounded by their venture capitalists who are beautiful visionary optimist, no one knows how to read a balance sheet, no one's paying any attention to the balance sheet of these businesses. I think it is incredibly important to make sure that you have visibility into the financial aspects of your business and are really thinking about capital allocation from the beginning. And that at its very core is thinking about operational efficiency. I think it's a really interesting transition as I look, this is independent of the market we're in, but what we did with Vision Fund 2 is we started to invest in earlier stage assets. We said, ""Vision Fund 1, we backed all the big companies in the world and we'd like more diversification. And we think we can go slightly earlier.""The smaller checks. So Vision Fund 2, our average check size is maybe a quarter of what it was with Vision Fund 1. And we were backing series B companies. The biggest differential in my mind between the series B and the series C companies, series B companies had only ever really raised in the past by off the basis of that founder's charisma and our ability to recruit and on the basis of some early inclination of what a market might look like in early product. But at that point, most of these founders have not really learned that they are making financial contract with those later stage investors that here is a financial plan they're expected to hit. But it really comes down to an under investment in that financial aspect of your business, understanding that financial aspect of your business. We spend a lot of time talking about how do we work with companies to strengthen their financial organizations, to help them understand strategic finance and operational finance, because it is understated as you get more mature. And I think it is fundamentally necessary to raise capital from growth investors.",2617
81,Lydia Jett - Investing in E-commerce,Lessons for Founders," Patrick: I would love to talk a bit more about this because I think thinking of companies as products that investors and employees buy is a really powerful way to think about a business. Everyone's focused on product and distribution rightfully so. Obviously those are the real drivers. Without those, you're definitely not going anywhere. But I think the lesson that founders are learning now as capital becomes a little bit more expensive and scarce, is that your company is a product and investors are the buyer in many ways. So what does great look like here? Is it hiring a CFO earlier is one thing you could do? But as you dig a layer or two down, what does great look like for those series B companies that understand this earlier than most? What actions do you consistently see them taking or recommend they take as they think about their later stage investors? Lydia: And that companies always turn and ask what specifically are you looking for, what specific metrics do you want us to hit. The reality is, there is just very rarely a magic number that we're looking for. We are looking at a company in the context of an overall picture. We're looking at it in the context of the team and product. But really, where we as growth equity investors start is an understanding the core economics of the business. So we are always spending time looking at unit economics. We are always spending time looking at cohort retention. We're always spending time looking at how does engagement change over time. I think that requires that your organization is collating data and parsing it and starting to think early about what are those things that your growth equity investors are going to be looking for so you're prepared to have those conversations. So does that mean to have a CFO onboard versus a VP of finance? No, but I think it really does mean that you need a strategic finance person. You need someone who can help you think through key KPIs that are going to be the most obvious set of KPIs and help you understand them. You can't just put them together. But you have to have a real view on them. And so that's why I do think of it as a partnership that needs to be invested in early. For every company we work with, we sit down and we say, ""What are the most important levers of this business? How are we tracking them? What does that trajectory look over time? And how are we hitting that trajectory on an actual basis relative to forecast?"" And that's just an expectation that we have, that our businesses are capable of talking through that. Not every business is capable of talking through it at the close of investment, but I think they have to show indications that they are numerically oriented in a way that gives us confidence that they will be able to build a business that will generate the type of returns that will compare to any other asset we look at, because we have the distinct advantage of being able to look at a lot of different companies and compare them to each other. So you have to help us build confidence that you are going to be a better capital allocator than those around you. Patrick: What do you think about the danger of premature optimization around a set of KPIs? Like anything, you start measuring something, you tend to start managing and the number tends to get better, right? What you don't know is what the hidden cost of that are. Is the product not maturing in the right way at the expense of making this number go up into the right? I'm sure there's no one right general answer here, but how do you think about that delicate balance of, ""It's not yet the time to start optimizing this KPI, we still need to make the product better""? Lydia: I think about that all the time, because one of the learnings that I've had is that every decision you make as a founder will have an unintended consequence in probably three. The really brittle businesses that get built are those where you aren't paying attention to understand what consequences are coming your way. To the specific question, business building is messy. Every single business I work with is a mess, including big corporate businesses, including SoftBank, including Amazon, including Google. It's really important to just acknowledge it and say it over and over again. Every business is a mess. And the question is, can you, as a business leader, identify what really matters and focus on making sure what really matters is happening. Are you going to get that wrong? Absolutely. I mean, this is a game of learning for all of us. For me, for you as an interviewer, it's for the operators who run businesses. If you form a static view and refused input new learnings, then I think you've already made a mistake. I think what we around the table hopefully as board members are doing are creating a safe space where you can say, ""This was what I had conviction in. We went and tested it. This is what we learned, and we think it's time to change."" And I think it's why it's so important to build a relationship of authenticity and trust because what I have found is, the founders who lean in and share the mistakes and the learnings and how they're changing are the founders that I build the best trust with. And those become the relationships that you get really excited to lean into as an investor. I think that the founders who feel the need to keep static and metric because that's what they told us they would do and aren't comfortable, aren't confident enough to tell me that it was wrong, that's where relationships don't develop in a way that you really need in a down market like this. I would encourage everyone to lean into the radical idea that everything is messy. It is worth really bringing that people, your constituency, around the table with you. Your investors, your employees, bringing them around the table, being really authentic and open about what's not working. And then making sure that you focus the attention on what you believe really matters most. And I think that is a good way to correct for all the learnings that we're amassing along the way. Patrick: I'm trying to think of a fun way of measuring this. The idea I'm getting at is how important this specific founder is for e-commerce businesses at the stage that you're investing in them. And I always think of the sports analogy of wins above replacement, where if you just put the average first basement in place of this great first basement, how many losses would the team give up or wins would the team give up? Is that number really high? Tony Xu is someone that comes to mind, where at DoorDash where if you took Tony out of the DoorDash story and replaced it with just a very good CEO, it just seems like it wouldn't work at all. He is just exceptional and right for that specific business and opportunity and how it's been built. Is that generally true? Do you think that maybe the leadership is even more important than we all kind of acknowledge that of this? Lydia: I sit in a camp where I think there are very, very few exceptional companies and very few exceptional leaders. I mean, I think if we walk away from this grand experiment with 20 exceptional founders out of a 300 founder portfolio... And if by exceptional, what do I mean? I mean, building a $20, $30, $40 billion company, I think we're all going to feel really good about ourselves because there just aren't that many people on the planet who can both be high enough to set a vision who can understand the thematics of setting the strategy and where you need to go, but can also dive deep enough to really understand the core drivers of the business. There are so few people who can do that high-low transaction transition on any given day. When it comes to these really operational businesses, I think you have to be someone who can dive deep enough to really understand the core of the business. I think you have to be analytically minded. You have to be able to run an organization with some quantitative framing. Because the economics of these businesses are so hard, you have to get them to massive scale to make the economics pay out or something has to change about the economics. I think DoorDash has shown that consumers are willing to pay far more than anyone thought they would for delivered food. I never thought that the consumer demand would stretch as far as it has so I think that has been an extraordinary learning there. But I also think Tony has been just a beautiful operator. You asked, are e-commerce CEOs different. I think they are. I really think you have to be extraordinarily disciplined because you are starting from a position of having impaired margins or an impaired economic profile. And the question is, how do you improve your economic profile to just match an offline profile? And then how do you support it getting better? It means you have to be really focused on a couple things that matter in your business as opposed to distracted by all of the other adjacencies you could lead into. Patrick: What are the major sources of that relative impairment? So why are e-commerce companies versus offline companies starting from a worst place? What drives that difference? Lydia: I don't start from a position that I so often hear in founder pitches about how traditional operators aren't good. I mean, I think we so often hear that insurance companies aren't good or retailers aren't good, but the reality is I actually think these companies are extraordinarily good. They've built very, very efficient businesses. Insurance companies have built very quantitatively adept businesses. I start from a position that I think if you try and compare yourself to a Walmart or a target as a retailer, you're competing against a really strong efficient organization. And what are the margin profiles on these businesses? You're talking about single digit margin profiles. When you know you're starting to position, once you get past product margin and then delivery margin is negative, you have to get to significant scale. You have to find ways to automate your processes in a way that can just get back parity from a margin profile perspective. And that's why we haven't seen a lot of digital businesses surpass the margin profile of the big offline retailer shop. We're still too human capital intensive. There is not enough automation in these businesses. Now, what these businesses have is growth. They're certainly eating consumer discretionary spend, but I think we all have to work harder to prove that we can have an advantaged economic profile relative to traditional businesses. Patrick: If I personally spend my time doing investing at the early stages now, went and shadowed Masa for a year, how do you think I would change or come away different? I guess that's another way of asking how you have changed or come way different by virtue of working with him. Lydia: It depends on the period of time. Every single one of us, whether we want to acknowledge it or not, are a product of the market environment we're in. What's so important for founders today, almost the first principle I lean into is understand the market you're in because you have to learn how to operate to it. This man has the ability to build very strong conviction in very big ideas. He really doesn't mess around with the small ideas. He doesn't get distracted by details. He builds a big vision that is supported by fundamental economic tailwinds, and he pursues it with a lot of clarity. But the other thing I think that he has, which I think is beautiful, is he can change on a dime and turn and do a 180. And as I look back at my 10, 12 year career before I joined SoftBank, for most financial institutions, for most investors, you can't do that. You've made a covenant with your LPs. You have defined your strategy. You said, ""This is who I'm going to be. And I'm going to be this for the next three funds as I come back to raise my next funds. My strategy is what I will do."" Organizations tend to be pretty sclerotic. You say, ""This is who I am. It's how I do what I do."" It's why you don't see that much change in venture outside of new entrance. Masa's the opposite. If he believes something is fundamentally changing, he can pivot a big organization so fast to follow that thematic. And I think it's why in this wild period of upheaval in the capital markets over the last five years, I've been in the capital markets for 20 years, I've never seen change the way I've seen it in the last five years, it's why SoftBank has been able to continue to stay in the forefront of headlines. Now, we can debate whether headlines are good or bad. Most of these headlines are bad. But it does really help to be able to orient your business as quickly as he is able to orient it with the big fundamental frameworks guiding his decisions. That's the sort of aspect one.I think something else that's beautiful about him is he really does operate in a high trust environment. This business is so hard in that it takes so long to figure out if anything you're doing is right. The feedback loop is just wild. And most people don't have the luxury of having a long time to prove out what they're doing. Their reality of partnership dynamics, around firm dynamics, dynamics with your LPs, is nobody really wants to give you 10 years of doing things that look wrong to everybody else to prove yourself out. I think one of the beautiful things about Masa is he is someone who grants a tremendous amount of trust to the people who work in the investing organization while there is of course accountability in every investment organization. I think he is really supportive of people doing what they believe in. And I think he is the first person to stand up when he makes a mistake and say ""I was wrong."" We see it over and over in our earnings calls. We saw it in the case of WeWork, we saw it last quarter. Masa stands up with humility and says ""I was wrong. I'm going to change. Here's what I'm going to do different."" But he really takes personal responsibility and grants trust very freely. And I think it allows organizations, it allows founders to think very big. Nobody's operating from a position of fear. People are operating from a position of optimism and excitement. As I take a step back and I say despite all the tough headlines we've had over the years, I feel like our brand has been extraordinarily strong with founders. Founders love the concept of SoftBank. They love the idea of Masa, they love someone who grants trust freely, who really believes in them, who is doing this not to make money but solely because he wants to work with founders and he wants to build big things. And that is sort of an intoxicating position to be in the middle of. Patrick: We've talked a lot about certain founders, but you have the benefit of having in different styles of investing. When you think about great investors, maybe especially outside of SoftBank, who comes most immediately to mind? And what about them is exceptional to you? Lydia: This almost harkens back to the earlier comment there are so many great ways to make money. The concept of great investor, I think you have to apply pretty broadly. The thing that is striking about the venture capital as a class is, it is so much more driven by luck and good fortune than traditional investing is, public market investing, private equity investing. These are very quantitative roles where you are really orienting yourself around math and understanding businesses in quantitative forum with an understanding that management teams can be changed in and out when they're not performing. It is a much more established, expected set of operations. Venture is just so different. Their reality is this is a people business. Big companies that are built, are built on the back of tremendous aggregation of talent, of people. And that in some ways is very hard to predict. In every way, it's hard to predict.I look at venture capital as a class, and I think that the people we term to be great investors often are the people who've been standing the longest. Now, do you have an ability to continue to amass capital to invest? Or have you been around the table for 15 years to be in and out of cycles? Have you been fortunate enough to be on a one or two or maybe three journeys that have worked? But there's so much luck involved and patience. I do think the beautiful thing about this industry is the longer you are in it, hopefully the calmer you get because of the reality that the impact you have on these companies is a lot smaller than you think it is going to be. When you enter any of them, it just needs to be a lot more grace and humility in patience, frankly, in the sector. Patrick: It's such an interesting place to close, this notion that the longer you'd spend doing this, the more humble you must become, and that survival is the name of the game. You may know my traditional closing question for everyone. What is the kindest thing that anyone's ever done for you? Lydia: I find the list on that is really long for most of us hopefully. I start with my mother who was just this extraordinarily hard charging leader in my small town in a way that made it acceptable for me to understand that that was a role that was open to me as well. And to my father who actually supported her version of events in all of that. I think a more tactical answer that I was thinking about is just the hundreds and hundreds of people who have given me feedback over the years. I was a pretty insecure person growing up. You kind of want to hide. You don't really know what value you have to add. Every person along the way who pulled me aside and gave me feedback, positive or negative, and a lot of positive feedback that made me feel like something I was doing was right, negative feedback that allowed me to learn and pivot, it makes me think all the time about who I am as a leader of my team and how do you make sure you take time out to give people feedback along the way that just helps them to establish confidence in what they're doing. I am just really thankful to all of the incredible people who have bothered to spend snippets of their time with me to give me feedback and what I'm doing. Patrick: Well Lydia, I've learned a lot today. I didn't really know what to expect from me, and I'm not an e-commerce expert by any stretch, but maybe above that, I think you probably meet your own definition of more nuance, humility, calm, whatever. Having been in this for a while, I've really, really enjoyed the conversation and so appreciate your time. Thanks so much for doing this with me.

82,"Josh Wolfe, Chris Power - Factories of the Future",Introduction," Patrick: My guests today are Josh Wolfe and Chris Power. Josh will be a familiar voice to many of you, and is the co-founder and general partner of Lux Capital. Chris is the founder and CEO of advanced manufacturing startup, Hadrian. Most of our discussion centers on the need to modernize the factories that supply our space and defense industries. But given the current market environment, we also talk about capital conditions and the responsibility to build products that really matter. Please enjoy this conversation with Josh Wolfe and Chris Power.",116
83,"Josh Wolfe, Chris Power - Factories of the Future",How The Advanced Manufacturing Industry Got Here," Patrick: Chris and Josh, this is going to be a totally different conversation about an area that I don't think I've ever explored before, very keyed in on a certain kind of manufacturing. I'm sure we'll hit bigger themes of onshoring of manufacturing in just the next generation of this part of the economy. We'll spend a lot of time around precision parts, what Hadrian's doing, why Lux is interested in this area, what Chris, you and your team, are building. To set the stage, Chris, it would be great if you could, as you did for me on the phone recently, give an overview of the recent past and what has happened in this world. It's become a topic that everyone's talking about a little bit, but probably doesn't really fully understand the recent intermediate past of manufacturing, where it happens, why it's happened that way. So a little bit of a history lesson would be a great place to start to frame our conversation. Chris: For advanced manufacturing, in general, which I describe as space, defense, semiconductor, eVTOL, energy, medical devices, basically everything in the Jetson's flying car, future, all has to be domestically manufactured because of ALTAI requirements. It's super high precision components. And basically, 80% of the manufacturing parts for those industries flows through a high precision network of machine shops. There's 3,000 or 4,000 of them. Average size is 10 to 12 million in revenue. In aggregate, they do 40-50 billion in revenue, but it's incredibly fragmented, super low NPS. It's the most perfect Keith Rabois fragmented, low NPS, vertically integrated structure you could ever possibly think of. Historically, what happened is this was built off the defense primes needing a bunch of suppliers. All these machine shops got built in the first Space Race or the Cold War. They were businesses that got started 30 years ago by 30 year olds. And now they are 30-year old businesses run by 60 year olds. What's happened in the last five years is there's not a lot of slack in the system. And generally, a machine shop might be making some semiconductor parts, some parts for Boeing, and then some parts for Raytheon, for example. In the last five years, because of the boom in commercial space, which has been largely driven by lowered launch costs, the success of companies like SpaceX and Anduril, and then investors like Josh have been putting money into satellite companies, rocket companies, the whole thing. If the top level, you've got a bunch of net new spend in high precision components from commercial space and companies like Anduril that are flooding the same supply chain. That's big problem number one.And what you're seeing for those customers is, ""Hey, I'm trying to ship a satellite really quickly. I'm getting parts in 6 to 10 weeks. That's insane. Because I've got an aerospace engineer sitting around for another part, wasting time, when I'm trying to get a launch up. I'm trying to get my startup goals."" So all these new entrants to the market are going way, way faster than your traditional primes. Now, that's putting speed pressure on the supply chain. And basically, you've got this thing where customers want fast supply chain, huge opportunity to build a business meeting that need, with a bunch of net new spend in the supply chain. That's phase one is Hadrian builds a better mouse trap for new space and new defense. The second phase, which is really scary for the country though, is all of those 60 year olds are going to retire in the next 5 to 10 years at an increasing rate. And 90% of them, historically, when they do retire, don't transition to private equity, or sell or transition the business to a son or a daughter. They sunset the business, lock the door, sell a machine, and throw away the keys. There's two bits that are really dangerous for the country about that. The first one is just purely capacity. In the decade where we're trying to butt heads with the CCP and win Space Race 2, the capacity that feeds rocket satellite, drone companies is going to fall through the floor because of this capacity issue. They're retiring, so you've got this huge supply and demand imbalance in the worst possible decade that that could be happening. And on top of that, it's not as simple as, say, a Raytheon going, ""Hey, Patrick's Machine Shop, you're retiring. Let's take all the digital files that tell someone how to make those parts, and give it to another machine shop."" Most of them have been made for 20 years. There's no CAD file. The drawing is in someone's desk drawer. And we've just seen this where we shipped something like a third of all our Stinger and Javelin missiles to the Ukraine. This is on the defense side, but this happens across space semiconductor really. So we shipped all over to the Ukraine. The Biden administration went to Raytheon and said, ""Hey, we need more Stingers and Javelins.And then Raytheon came back and said, ""Well, apart from the fact that supply chain's super bottlenecked and we can't ramp up production, we just don't know how to make any of the parts anymore. And it might take a couple of years to figure it out."" So it's a complete disaster, both on net new spends in secular growth and decline. But what people don't realize is it's not as simple as, ""Hey, let's raise your semiconductor. Let's throw a 50 billion into an Intel plant in Arizona."" Because in the '70s and '80s, when we outsourced advanced manufacturing, what we lost was not just capacity or capability, it was the talent and the people. And what people don't understand about manufacturing, it's like software engineering. To get AI researchers, you have to have a base of backend software engineers. You've got a million software engineers, and it breeds the best. It breeds the best. And all of a sudden, you've got some top tier people in deep cloning and all that other stuff. It's the same in manufacturing. You can't really skip these training levels. So what we lost was not the knowhow to do a specific part, but the talent base that can produce better and better people that can work on things like semiconductors or advanced manufacturing. The slack in the system is not simply a capital problem. It's this talent based problem. You can solve some of that by trying to grab some people from Taiwan, people who really know this, and rebuild all these industries. But it's much, much slower than people think it is because it's not as simple as turning a capital key, buying some machines, and ramping up production capacity. It's incredibly difficult to do. It's a huge commercial opportunity, but it's incredibly important that we get this right for the country because space is basically a defense domain. Peace through strength is a huge deal. We've created this period of peace with Pax Americana. And I think in the next couple of years, maybe in the next 18 months, we're going to really see that a lot of that is risked, and there's going to be a huge wake up call when the average American consumer not just can't buy an iPhone for less than $4,000, possibly can't buy one at all because of all this global shifting of the advanced manufacturing supply chain. Patrick: I want to go through all of the interesting aspects of the factories you're building, what precision manufacturing is relative to generic manufacturing, and some of the technology innovation around how these factories will work, and components of the factory.Before we do that, Josh, I would love to hear your investing view, having the benefit of having invested in a lot of related or complementary areas of technology, as to why this is so important, on the one hand, and then also on the same breath, why it's an interesting investing opportunity, because it clearly sounds incredibly important. It also sounds very hard to do. With your investor hat on, I'd love to hear both perspectives. Josh: Something I've shared with you in the past is this idea of 100-0-100, that I have a 100% certainty will be investing in the most cutting edge stuff, 0% certainty what those things will be, which is really this false humility, and then a 100% certainty of where we'll find them, which is the edge of our cutting edge companies. It started in space, which went from Bill Gates funded Kymeta with us, which is doing antennas. And then we have these guys at Dogpatch area of San Fran, that launched this company called Cosmogia, that then becomes Planet Labs. One thing sort of leads to the next. Now, it was inside of Planet where they had taken this idea from software, and applied it to hardware of agile aerospace. The idea that they were going to do very rapid iterative launches. In some cases, they were going to do it by design. And they're choosing, in some cases, they were going to do it because the rockets that they were launching on would blow up, and they need to launch again. But the idea that they needed to manufacture much more rapidly, high volumes with small form factors, was something that was interesting. And they were doing this by hand, in-house. People physically manufacturing the stuff. Now, as the company started to grow and demand gets higher, and they're going from 31 Doves that they're launching to several hundred, and then they acquire another company, and they're doing larger scale entities with Skybox, the manufacturing demands get much higher.That was really our first preview into the need to have the equivalent of a TSMC domestically, or whatever sort of analog you want of some sort of competitively advantaged manufacturing facility. I had this moment when I was introduced to Chris, which we love, which is the ""Wait, what?"" moment, when you hear something and you're like, ""Wait a second. What does everybody talk about?"" They talk about wanting to be a neurosurgeon or a rocket scientist. The people that are literally the rocket scientists are manufacturing things for SpaceX and Blue Origin, the crème de la crème, the elite of American industry, through these 3,000 mom-and-pop shops that, as Chris alluded demographically, are basically at retiring age. We had that moment of like, ""Wait, what?"" Chris had that moment, and was sort of originally looking at this, ""Do you do a private equity roll up? Do you aggregate a bunch of these things?"" And I think he came to the conclusion, and you can query him on this, it's going to be better to do this from first principles and just do it differently with modern technology. In the same way, going back to the same software analogy, that Planet was looking at this and saying, ""Okay, how do you go to agile aerospace, just like you were doing agile software development?"" You had this other insight that Chris identified of not only the industry structure, but the structure of how people were spending their time. So if you're an engineer in aerospace, half to two thirds of your time was spent sitting and waiting for parts. This dependency, this bottleneck, which you had no control over. If you really wanted that to be very rapidly iterating and have the reliability and not be beholden to one bottleneck that was one supplier or two suppliers, you needed to be able to do something about that.In the software industry, you had all these people that basically identified that there were these bottlenecks, and then developed them, whether they were in comms, they were in payments, they were in databases. So you would get Twilio, Stripe, MongoDB, that rose to meet that. I think it was just a super novel insight that Chris had to say, ""I can build the factory that builds the machines."" We got very inspired by that. He was seeing it firsthand, knowing that a ton of capital was going into this long tail of aerospace and defense companies who were tinkering on the edge, and then starting to get real money, raising hundreds of millions of dollars, and doing many, many programs. Anduril started with one core product in perimeter defense with the Sentry Tower. And then they went into aerial platforms. Now we have subsea platforms, and growing on and on. The manufacturing demands, the capabilities, the speed, the reliability that they need, all meant that there was a growing demand that, as Chris also elucidated, was coming up against a supply capability that is 60 years old. I think Chris framed the industry really well. He approached it not as some starry-eyed engineer that was like, ""We're going to go to space and change the world."" He was asking the question that we love, ""What sucks?"" And he was like, ""This sucks. The way that the industry works sucks. Then there's got to be a better way to do it."" That insight around overall industry structure, how engineers were spending their time, seeing the demand function from a whole line of our companies, and seeing that there had to be a better way. And that better way was going to be a combination of cutting edge hardware and cutting edge software. Patrick: I actually just did one of these with Brian from Anduril. And it was really interesting to dive into the nature of the pieces of what they're building and their goal for speed, simplicity, modularity the philosophy of how these things are built, whether it's Ghost or whatever the product is at Anduril, is it's very different from a Predator drone or something that Lockheed or Northrop would put out over the course of a decade. I'm curious, Chris, how much you think in the success case for Hadrian, where it's everything you dreamed of and more, 10 years from now, how its existence changes the nature of the things that get built? What will this new manufacturing capability, just like Stripe and Twilio, people build stuff that they couldn't have dreamed of before because they were able to go so fast with this new tooling, how do you think about that, Chris, in terms of what this might lead to? That even though there's amazing things happening at SpaceX and everywhere else, it's on the back of these 3,000 mom-and-pops. What will be different in the success case for Hadrian, for the people at the top of the chain? Chris: I think if you think about software engineering 10 years ago, maybe to start a SaaS company, it costs a million dollars, and you were spending more than 50% of your time on activity like running a server farm or building payments that every single software company had to deal with. When you see these platform infrastructure companies like AWS come out, or Stripe come out, or Twilio, you get to really interesting dynamics. One of which is the cost to start a company in this space goes through the floor. So now with all the tooling, you can start a software company for a couple hundred dollars. Secondly, the number of companies that get started because of that tooling goes through the roof. And then the third thing is the speed at which those companies can iterate, basically turn engineering time into a good product that the market wants, goes through the roof because their iteration cycle goes through the roof.If we get this right, we should be able to drive three things. One is that existing companies can iterate on products in order of magnitude faster, which means that at the product layer, you just get better products. You're not doing a year long cycle for a satellite. You're doing a two month cycle for a satellite. As you're getting feedback from the customer, your designs can change way, way faster. Secondly, by having Hadrian as a platform, we should be able to dramatically lower the cost of starting advanced manufacturing companies, which will drive a Cambrian explosion in both this evolutionary, who's winning in the marketplace to build a satellite company or a drone company. The raw number of these companies that start will go through the roof. And that would be success for me. Josh: One of the things you just said, which I think is really interesting, there's this old thought experiment, which was actually manifest in a physical experiment, where you took two different classrooms of people that were making some sort of pottery. They had a very specific end state of a pot that they had to make. And one was told, ""Spend two hours or an hour or whatever it was making the pot as perfect as you can."" And the other was told, ""Make as many pots as you can."" The latter, which was rapidly iterating, and trial and error, and trial and error, ended up making the more perfect pot. So that idea, which I think applies to industry, is if you make something and then you're waiting forever to test it in the real world versus being able to rapidly iterate. The latter example is something that Hadrian's going to enable, that in turn then, lets many more startups flourish for less capital. We can do more experiments, fund more companies. They can fail fast. Or they can come up with a product that is superior and competitive, and then build a platform from there.",3688
84,"Josh Wolfe, Chris Power - Factories of the Future",Understanding The Demand & Supply Forces At Play," Patrick: It's fascinating to think about, and it demands the question on the demand side. You've talked about the supply side, being this fragmented mom-and-pop 3,000 base. Today, just in its current state, Chris, what does the demand side look like? Who are the biggest sources of revenue for those 3,000 shops? And then obviously, I want to talk about where that's going in the future. But just in terms of today's state, what does that look like? Chris: For a highly vertically integrated commercial space company, so all the new space companies, so rockets and satellites, the demand is coming directly from them, from their supply chain team. For legacy space or defense, usually what happens is Lockheed gives the engine to Pratt, and then Pratt has two companies underneath Pratt, making engine components. And then underneath that, there's a bunch of machine shops, which actually is one of the reasons why apart from now, it's been a hard problem to spot because most people don't tap Lockheed down past three layers of supply chain. But if you look at all the supply issues, eventually you end up at Bob's machine shop all the way down. The demand is coming from two main drivers, the net new spend from all these new companies starting stuff. But also on the defense side, I'll give you an example of a large prime that took a tour of Hadrian's factory yesterday and now we're engaging really heavily, is they've got 500 machine shops in their current supply chain, just for sustaining existing programs where they've promised the government as a customer, ""Hey, we're going to help you make X number of F-35s,"" as an example.They're just looking at the rate of parts that they need to produce to hit those current goals. And the current machine shops can't produce the amount of parts to meet the current production rate. Much less if we go into a conflict scenario, we need to increase the number of F-35s being made. So it's not even a net new spend problem, ""Hey, there's a bunch of innovation in defense"", flooding it with new business. It's literally just a sustainment. Can we produce the number of parts? And what's scary was, over the last three years, this was a bad problem three years ago because of the 737 MAX crash, a bunch of machine shops that were doing some space or defense work might have had 30% of their business coming from Boeing. So they got wiped out because Max paused, so there's a bunch of revenue drop, and none of these companies have got a year's worth of cash on hand. They're like 30 days payroll situation. So you got a bunch of people that got wiped out there. And then during COVID a bunch more people got wiped out because some of the workforce just decided to retire. So you've got these big supply side hits as demand is increasing, and it's causing this weird kind of slack effect that is really, really dangerous. Patrick: Josh, what do you think about how the nature of demand will shift? You know the legacy companies, you've been an investor in some of the modern companies like and Anduril, I'm interested, not just in the nature of the company meeting Anduril's different than Lockheed, but also space versus defense versus something else. As you think about the future of demand for this style of manufacturing, based on what you've learned through your portfolio, what do you see and what do you think about? Josh: Overall there's more demand because there's more people trying more experiments. If you take space as one example with each new capability, somebody else is like, ""Well, what if we did this?"" I made this analogy before about taking effectively the railroads from the 19th century and turning it vertically and you can look as an analogy that first you're going to have the rails and the locomotives and the steam engines and the cars. Today, SpaceX, Rocket Lab, Relativity, others. Then you have people that are saying, ""Okay, we're going to make all kinds of different satellites and things to put on a bus."" Then you have people that are designing the bus itself. Actually we have a company which would've been absurd five years ago, which is Varda. The idea that you're going to actually manufacture something in space. They're designing their systems and engineering that. Then they've negotiated with Rocket Lab to actually make the bus. And then they're taking that bus, and in a stroke of improbable diplomacy or actually putting it on a SpaceX rocket. Those are two competitors. SpaceX, if you're totally conspiratorial and paranoid, is worried Rocket Lab is going to try to blow up their rocket with a payload. But that ecosystem would've been absurd. If you would've said, ""Oh yes, we're going to have two rocket companies,"" say 10 years ago, ""that are going to be competing. And one of them is going to make a bus that could actually hold somebody else's commercial space application, and then we're going to launch..."" This natural ecosystem white space filling, which you see anytime that there's resources, and in this case, the resources are talent, ambition, and then capital, people are just experimenting and trying all kinds of stuff. We funded one of the former Lux Family entrepreneurs with Woz and a company called Privateer, looking at space junk. They're going to not only take off the shelf data, but they're actually launching crafts so that they can monitor some things.You have people that are doing refueling. You have people that are looking at the not actual physical disintegration, but the diplomatic disintegration of Russia, US cooperation on the ISS. There's going to be lots of little private space stations. There's going to be storage. There's going to be depots. And then on the rockets themselves, what's quite interesting, and this is something that we have debated, I still think it's quite early, so we haven't committed, but people are going from vertically integrated rockets where every single company is basically designing their engine, designing their hulls, and doing all their logistics internally. On the hardware side, we're seeing independent engine companies, and the bet that you would want to make on those companies is akin to aerospace or on automotive. You might have a single OEM that is assembling these things, but the engines are being made by somebody else. At the moment, we still think that there's probably a few years where people feel it's mission critical that they have to design their own engines. You had some geopolitical thrust right now, pun intended, that has caused the RL10 to be unavailable. You had Aerojet Rocketdyne basically blocked by the DOJ. They're really the only US game in town. So there are going to be some people that are going to be machining parts for engines, and eventually that will go from vertically integrated to horizontal. I just can't handicap today whether that happens in the next two years or 20, but it feels likely that it will. Then you have people on the software side that are filling ecosystem niches in this where they're starting to come out of SpaceX, where they did logistics in flight planning and command and control, and now they're spinning it out and saying, ""Hey, we could do this for other people."" They couldn't have done that five years ago because the ecosystem and the demand from other startups wasn't there. Now there's is a company called Epsilon3, they can go off and do that independently for others. That cocktail of talent, capital, and new companies and ambitions is creating white space, and Chris is going to be the arms dealer here. Chris: The analogy I would use is you know how with traffic management you turn a four lane highway into a five lane highway, and then all of a sudden there's more cars, not less. Any move that the ecosystem makes, whether it's disintermediating engines into a company like Ursa Major, who's just done a huge engine deal with another company. Or it's a vertically integrated company. It's like, okay, launch is now cheaper, so more payloads get built, therefore because more payload companies get funded, more rocket companies and engine companies in that ecosystem get funded. So you get this double multiplier effect. And whatever part of the demand cycle is going up, whether it's more launch vehicles, more engines, more payloads, whatever, all three of those axes point downstream to Hadrian. At that macro level, doesn't really matter where the demand cycle shifts. Essentially we're the ones making the roads or the bitumen or whatever, whether it's more cars or EVs or five lane highways or 10 lane highways, it all goes downstream to the same thing. Patrick: Chris, can you help us understand, going all the way to the beginning of the supply chain, the rare earth or base metal component of this process? Because I don't think people have probably thought too much about is this aluminum, is it steel, is it titanium, is it something else? What's the 101 on the actual raw materials that are important in this process? Because out of nowhere, after a decade of silence, the commodity world has come alive. There's issues shipping, there's issues sourcing, there's issues in pricing, there's inflation. This becomes a really important thing really quickly. So give us a little tutorial on what are the important metals that go into all of these shops as raw material and anything that you think we should know about the nature of that today? Chris: Basically there are four main alloys that all space defense semiconductor satellite companies use. Aluminum, 6061, 7070, steel variants, so 306, 316, 30X, titanium, and then Inconel variants. There's a ton of aluminum on satellites. There's slightly less aluminum on rockets. And then on rockets, you start to get into steels and harder metals like titanium and inconel because the closer you get to the engine, the hotter it is, so you need material that can withstand heat. And then it's the same thing for the defense side. So if you look at a fighter jet, there's a bunch of structural aluminum, there's a bunch of structural titanium, because it's incredibly lightweight, and then the engine is incredibly hard, heat withstanding materials like inconel. Those are the input materials to the parts. So let's talk about that. I mean, let's talk about the parts that are on the machines that we run in our factory, because that's a little bit scarier. In a sense, I think the aluminum price over the last year, it's come down a little bit now, but I think it doubled. That was a supply chain shock from the inputs, but then the mills themselves in America had a labor shortage. There was just lack of supply, so the price went up. The parts that went on those satellites during that nine month period, the machine shop can't absorb them, so it gets passed on, so the satellites are now 30% more expensive. And if you look at where those materials get sourced from, we have a pretty good supply of aluminum in the United States. 90% of the titanium in the world comes from Russia and the Ukraine. A bunch of aluminum and steel comes from Europe as well. And actually, if you look back to the Cold War, our spy planes were made out of mostly titanium. Skunkworks had to sneak titanium out of Russia to be able to make spy planes.This is why I think a lot of the hand waving around sanctions is ridiculous, because if you're in an adversarial position and you say, ""Hey, we're doing all these sanctions,"" and then there's 50 exclusions because you're kidding yourself about the fact that this guy's the only one with a titanium. It's just ridiculous. That is a real problem both on lack of production, but also availability of supply to American companies because a lot of that is offshore, which makes me crazy, because the State Department years ago should have been going to Latin America and Africa and getting supply of all this stuff and partnering with these countries and raising them up. Whereas China through Belt and Road has secured a lot of this global supply because they've got Russia locked up with the whole energy pipeline thing. They've got Africa locked up. So it's a real huge challenge. For rare earth materials, which are more things that go into batteries, chips, that sort of stuff, they're not on the parts that we're producing, but our machines obviously have a ton of chips in them. And then every single satellite or rocket has a bunch of chips or circuit boards in them. So that's a huge problem, and that's way more strategic because obviously 70% of the world's chips come from Taiwan, most of which is TSMC. And then the other thing is the rare earth minerals like lithium or cobalt are largely Latin American, but the Latin American mines are much, much less developed. That's a huge challenge as well. Patrick: Do we need a Hadrian for that stage of things too? It seems like that's the most limiting factor. We can't exactly innovate our way to more titanium or something in the ground in the United States or in a friendly place. What do you think happens there? Chris: It depends how responsive the administration wants to be. If it was me three years ago, I would've dumped several billion dollars into subsidizing Rio Tinto and putting them in Latin America and doing a big deal with Australia to produce a lot of that stuff and subsidizing shipping instead of relying off European supply chains. That was just incredibly dumb and incredibly obvious that we need that robustness. The chips thing is even scarier because the administration has put 50 billion into giving Intel grants to build a semiconductor facility in Arizona, but then you get the same talent problem. You can put as much capital into Arizona as you want, but are there 5,000 people that can build and operate that thing in the country? No. And you can't train people in two years. It takes five to 10 years to learn these skills. So yeah, there's also a shock on that side of things. Patrick: Josh, how do you see the bigger supply chain things at the root level as concerns or opportunities? Josh: From an investment standpoint, it really is large scale private equity in my view. It's very hard to think about commodity mining. We've seen so many technologies and I just think it's very difficult for venture like returns with such by definition commodity margins. From a geopolitical standpoint, something that I've been advocating for is the Western Hemisphere Alliance. We've probably for 20 or 30 years neglected Central and South America. We've fought a war on drugs. We've tried to build a wall, at least half the country has. Particularly if you see a rising China and you look at sheer population, access to commodities, just for strategic geopolitical reasons, South America, Central America, Southern part of North America should absolutely be an allied block. And I would make that priority number one if I was president for the day or secretary of state right now. Patrick: Chris, if we zoom all the way back to the unit here of the mom and pop machine shop, what are the key set of jobs being done by one of those given shops? You mentioned the nature of them. It's the 60 year old soon to retire making 10 or $12 million revenue per shop or something like this. What are the key components that are inside each of those shops that you want to lift out as core functions or jobs to be done and then start innovating on inside of a Hadrian factory? Chris: There's three big chunks. One is the digital side of manufacturing, which is taking a customer PDF print and doing a bunch of creative geometry work to get that into machine code that tells the machine how to cut the part. That's one big chunk, and that's very software automation heavy. The second chunk is running the machine itself, which again is less of a robotics problem. It's more of a software engineering problem. So what a master machinist does on the control is a lot of manipulating code on the fly as they respond to slight differences in the cutting tools, slight differences in the raw material. That's a big operations software problem. And then the third layer is general logistics. So you've got unpredictable cycle times of each operation in the factory, you've got huge variances in how long something takes to inspect from one part to the other. And then you've got a lot of customer requirements that are incredibly variable for each purchase order that comes through. And as an example, this is a very simple example, but can create a lot of operational noise if you don't get it really right at the top end of the funnel is laser marking a part. So producing all these space components and then at some point an engineer's going to want to test it, often there's a call out on the print that says, ""Hey, engrave this part with a serial number, the purchase order number, or the print revision that the aerospace engineer said, 'This is my part number.'""You might think that's easy, but there are about 10 aerospace known specifications of the depth of the laser engraving, how big or small it has to be, and what the function of that is. In a regular machine shop, you might have a guy running a laser machine that's staring at a PDF print that might remember the specification. So a lot of it is that documentation of that engineering knowledge and then systemizing it so that the whole thing flows smoothly, yet haven't got a bunch of random art going on. Even load balancing that is an insane challenge because you might have all these machines set up for making the part, inspecting the part, cleaning the part. But if you get one of those throughput messages wrong, where you've got, say, 10 jobs running through a facility at once, but they all happen to hit the quality inspection station at the exact same time, all of a sudden you've got a bottleneck and all the jobs are late. Before you tell the customer, ""Hey, we can get this in two weeks,"" having that load balancing like a data center with foreknowledge of where the capacity bottlenecks might be in three weeks so you can make good judgment calls on what you're promising versus what you're delivering is a huge data science and operational excellence challenge. Patrick: What does Hadrian factory number one look like? What is going on inside of this thing and how does the unit of the factory evolve in your vision over time? Chris: Factory one is about 20,000 square foot and is definitely our R&D facility where we've got a lot of people standing around watching our automation run and then catching errors. We're effectively spotting bugs in both the process and the system and the operations. Factory two, which we're moving into in the first week of July, construction's about to finish, which has been a massive fight. As an example of supply chains, to segue, four weeks ago you couldn't get concrete in America. So we had to solve that problem, which I didn't think I'd be doing running a technology company. But anyway. Factory two is the one where we'll have probably 30 to 40 machines in rows and we're really dialing into gross margin efficiency where we're trimming everything to the point where you can throw a customer job through, it flows through with almost zero errors, and then we're really figuring out how to optimize costs and then ramp capacity.Basically what it looks like today is there's a startup office with a bunch of people on laptops writing machine code, operators standing in front of machines that are mostly automated, and then when something goes wrong, we're catching that error, documenting how we can prevent that from ever happening again, and then using a bit of human knowledge to kickstart the process. It's that learning cycle that we're going through over the next three to four months that is going to smooth everything out. And we slap down the accelerator and just feed the factory machine with a bunch of customer jobs and it will flow through pretty smoothly, but it's incredibly complicated. We have five different software products that integrate with each other. There's four different pieces of hardware and they all have to work together. So one thing breaks, everything breaks. Dialing in that robustness before we really hit the scale is really, really important.",4377
85,"Josh Wolfe, Chris Power - Factories of the Future",Investing in Cutting-Edge Manufacturing Technology," Patrick: Josh, how do you prosecute diligence for something like this as an investor. Hearing all that, I'm going to ask more follow up questions in the minute on the unit of the machine and the areas of innovation and the machinists, et cetera. But when you're facing something like this early on and it is factory one or factory one's still a glint in your eye, how do you do diligence on someone's ability or a team's ability to execute something like this? Josh: I'm probably going to get myself in trouble with this. First you make an investment in another company that fails. Patrick: Good start. Josh: And that's what we did. We and Founders Fund actually were co investors in a company that did not work. Part of that was narrow focus, part of that was team and structure. There was something proverbially different with Chris that their light shone brighter. As you can hear him talk, not only understanding the macro, but if you have a customer like Brian, Andrew, or Palmer, they want to anodize titanium and aluminum and parts that not only have electric chromatic coatings that strengthen and provide performance, but look really cool. They're super high demanding, yeah. So Chris's understanding of the macro to the micro is something that was inspiring, but we were still making a bet without any existence proof of why we were basically going to make a very similar investment as we had before, but this time was different, those dangerous words. And it truly came down to his vision of understanding industry structure, his vision of seeing the technological pieces that could be put together. Notably, he told us why we lost money in our last investment, which was super valuable. So he diligenced our failure to diligence properly our prior investment. And part of that was you don't want to automate everything.He's like, ""You don't want a 100% automation. You need humans in the loop in some of these aspects."" Maybe you want 80/20 or 70/30, but you need people that are there able to very quickly look at the geometry of a part or design, make a human decision, let the computer do it. A lot of it really came down to Chris understanding the macro, the micro of individual parts, the flow, where bottlenecks were. And then I think this is really important, you really have two different cultures. You have a machining culture, which is very blue collar in many cases. It is people working with their hands and really deep narrow specialists. And then you have this coding software culture, which is almost the antithesis of that. It would be good to actually hear from Chris, how do you think about those two people speaking very different languages, sometimes growing up and going to very different schools, actually being teammates and working with each other, because that answer that we got from him was super confidence inspiring. Chris: The difficult thing, going back to previous failures in his space, was both in private equity and software engineering trying to automate manufacturing, the previous approaches have been very egotistical in the sense of, ""We don't need any industry knowledge."" Either I'm a guy with a spreadsheet and I know how to do an IRR calculation. Operations doesn't generate profit, finance does. So the attitude towards machinists or manufacturing people is very downwards looking. I saw the same arrogance in Silicon Valley, which was, ""Let's not try and work with the best in the industry to automate this in the right way."" It's, ""Let's grab 30 PhDs and don't hire a machinist until employee number 28 and just try and figure it out ourselves,"" which for me is just this very coastal elite looks down on flyover state dynamic. What I recognized was in machining, all of the problems have been solved by people, the knowledge is in a bunch of people's brains. It's not like we're inventing a new algorithm for machining. If we did nothing, but just find all the right answers and get them into software and process, we would win immediately. To do that you have to create a culture where people feel comfortable working with a software engineer and machinist and an operations person all in one conversation and setting the standard that just because you've got a maths degree from Yale and this guy didn't graduate high school, setting that culture so they work collaboratively and there's no finger pointing or whatever and everyone's pulling in the same direction is really, really important. This was one of the most important things that I worked on, and it's a combination of making sure, even really simple things like no matter of whether you're a machinist or a software engineer, your equity that you get in Hadrian is the same based on your rank. The pay is the same. All this other stuff is super, super, super important.Really finding the people from industry that want to share their knowledge and want to train people, is an incredibly rare thing. So we're incredibly lucky to have the 20 or 30 people in industry that actually want to share their knowledge and understand that we're all pulling in the same direction. And that is a really unique thing. To give you an example of how scary this is, even at the most innovative space companies, to train someone on how to inspect a part is usually this thing of like, ""Hey, we've got all these amazing people that want to work in manufacturing but I'm on X number of dollars per hour, and I don't want to share my knowledge because my job is at risk."" Even something as simple as training new entry to the workforce is incredibly hard because of this protectionism. People ask me what the secret sauce is, and I think investors think we invented this new technology and that's the core of the company. The core of the company is 50 people soon to be 80 and 100 pulling in the same direction. Understanding that what we're building is a culture of, here's a problem let's solve it and no matter where the solution is coming from, implement it and work together. That's the core of what we're building which long term is going to be a huge, huge advantage. Because if we get Hadrian right, there's no reason why we can't take the same team and go solve tube bending or raw material or whatever it happens to be. Patrick: You described this the first time we talked as the PhD arrogance trap, which I really liked as a phrase. Thinking you can just solve every single problem immediately with technology. Interesting to hear about the inner relationship between the two teams or the two modalities. When it comes to the individual machine and the machinist working together inside of a Hadrian factory, again maybe starting to squint a little bit and look out 2, 3, 4, 5 years, what do you think the innovation zones are on the machine side specifically? In what ways will a Hadrian machine be better five years from now than it is today? Because it sounds like there hasn't really been much innovation on the machines themselves in these mom and pop shops? Chris: Actually, I think that's slightly incorrect. But I would say that we are not really innovating on the machines themselves. And that's part of the trick here is we are buying everything mostly off the shelf and then doing really tight software integrations to override the core software that lives on these machines to make them run better. But we're not doing mechatronics and upgrading the machines themselves. Building your own machines while trying to scale a factory is like two impossible tasks. What we're really doing is going, ""Hey, these machines have APIs that control everything about them."" No one's ever used an API for this machine ever before, and that's really where the technology curve is honestly. Even down to simple things like, you're meant to be able to run a machine overnight without it stopping itself. There's actually 20 or 30 reasons why a machine would stop itself running. A Tool breaks, something goes wrong in the controller, it's like a literal software bug. A lot of our automation is actually building the robustness into these vendor machines so that they self-correct overnight so we can get the throughput and the efficiency.One of the reasons why you have a second shift at a machine shop, which is incredibly inefficient, is because someone's hanging around waiting for the machine to error out and they know how to clear the error and get it going again. Which sounds insane, but that's honestly 70% to 80% of the problem. It's hilarious having people from industry where we come back in the morning and the machines run itself overnight and there's 10 good parts sitting there. And people are like, ""Wow, this is amazing."" I'm like, ""What do you mean? These machines are designed to run overnight?"" And they're like, ""No, well, it almost never happens in reality."" The reason is, because over the last 5 to 10 years, the amount of software that's in these machines has grown exponentially, but no customer of the machines has ever been able to take advantage of it because, what machinists knows how to write software? What machine shop can afford to pour a software engineer into the problem? Or even if they had a software engineer, have them spent three months of R&D on figuring all this stuff out versus just firefighting operations because they're trying to deliver for a customer. So that's more what's going on than us innovating on the hardware side. Patrick: And the innovation, the units of innovation themselves driven by software, is better-cheaper-faster the right way to think about what you hope to accomplish by starting to tune the dials using software? Chris: Definitely on the front end of the factory in the digital manufacturing CAD and CAM programming space, 100%. Because you just want to turn a 20 hour process into a 2 hour process. It's possible. It should be done. We're chipping away at the marble and will get there. For the factory, I actually think that simplification and robustness are the two most important things, because in manufacturing, complexity and lack of robustness are what drives costs. You're actually better off having a system that works every single time that's simple. That gives you two things. One is, there's less errors so there's not a bunch of people firefighting. And because it's simple, you can train many, many more people into that system. Getting rid of a lot of the complexity of making everything truly error proof is a lot of the innovation there, which seems counterintuitive. But in the real world, you want as little errors as humanly possible versus trying to dial up the efficiency on something so high that it breaks one in even every 10 times and all of a sudden you've got three or four people standing around figuring out how to solve the problem. That's really, really what's important there.Now, what you get from that is speed. So speed is not necessarily like, cut the part faster. It's at every handover point, don't have to go back in the step, go back in the step or have this station hanging around waiting for information because you've got errors. So the whole factory speed is optimized by having each of these individual pieces incredibly robust. For the customer layer, they get speed. What's great about speed is everyone wants it, so we also get pricing power. As we hit the robustness layer, we have margin efficiency growth because people are hitting things every single time cleanly versus running around scrambling like, where's this bit of paper, where's this tool? Now on the customer layer because we are reliable and fast, we have enormous pricing power. It's this interesting dynamic about manufacturing where, if you just focus on robustness and cleanness of the process, you kind of generate margin improvement automatically and therefore you get pricing power because you're fast and you reliable. Patrick: Josh, these factories and everything in them sound really expensive. And we're entering a new era I think for investing, especially in the private markets where capital is more expensive, it's harder to come by. Obviously something liker Hadrian requires capital up front to get to scale. Maybe you could share your concept of bubble/anti-bubble that you were walking me through, which I think is really interesting that I know you're writing about right now. As you think about funding companies through this period of time, and I'm curious for your take on this period of time relative to others and the constraints that will be placed on capital from an entrepreneur's perspective, but how do you think about funding this type of company that isn't a software company that can be started for a couple 100 bucks, through this period, through that framework? Josh: I generally like things that are more expensive because in theory you have a mote and that mote might be capital. The idea of this bubble/anti-bubble, and I'll talk about this in the context of the anti-bubble for Hadrian, but in this current moment where people are being shell shocked, I think we're entering an L-shaped May, June, July 2000, probably persist for 18 months or two years. We're in this plateau. We'll go through denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance. And I think we're somewhere between denial and anger. And I personally speculate that that anger will be directed at the Fed and you'll have an occupy the Fed movement, sort of like you had an occupy Wall Street movement, with crypto bros on one side and gold bugs on the other. I don't know, anyway. I want to insulate cutting edge tech companies that are producing science and technology. Insulate them from the macro, the micro, domestic chaos, political election, Trump coming back on Twitter or being reelected ... and just insulate them for three or four years with enough cash that they can really focus on developing the cutting edge tech. And then when the chaos has subsided, if it subsides, they will emerge as the dominant tech provider for whatever they're doing. That is one strategy which is basically, help people start companies at the earliest stage doing that and give them cash so that they're protected. And that the only risks that they're really taking are the technological and science risk early on and then ultimately the market risks some years later, but not the financing risk for the next few years.Because I think cost of capital is going to be higher. Cost of capital being higher also leads to the anti-bubble, which is basically all the people that have raised, in some cases crazy valuations, overconfident to under capitalized, overestimated and under reserved by investors, are just going to be doing serious down rounds. You will see a phenomenon that goes from extensions of current rounds to unnatural investors that are in SPVs. You'll see positive inducements from existing investors to get smaller investors in. And then you'll see negative pay-to-play punitive things where people are like, ""Okay, wait a second. We're not letting free riders participate if we're carrying all the risk in this company."" So there's going to be a lot of structure. And then eventually there'll be corporate divestitures, spinoffs, recaps. A lot of people just have no experience doing that. What we've told our companies over the past year and a half is basically, capitalize, raise as much money as you can, and now that you have as much money as you can, husband that cash, and don't invest in unprofitable or improbable growth. Instead, invest in consolidating your sector. I think there's a really good chance that some of the companies, which Chris was alluding to before with that 737 example, where Boeing gets hit and suddenly a huge book of their business is done. Give people that are basically hanging it up, either because of post COVID or retiring, that there's going to be customers that are going to be acquirable, accounts that will be acquirable, old machines that might be acquirable.I think that if you are well capitalized and have momentum and start to get the market share, and you get the market share also as Chris was alluding to, that because you can deliver faster, on time, better price, that you'll have the tailwinds.Those companies will be competitively advantaged. We'll be putting a lot more money into those companies that we think can use that capital, and basically it be a lower cost of capital to other companies that have a higher cost of capital and sort of weaponize it for them to go through a period of consolidation. In terms of financing a company like Hadrian, it is more capital intensive. Chris has given us a lot of confidence very early on of two things. One is his ability to raise capital, and not by promising the world or hyping, but by being thoughtful about syndicate construction. Getting investors in that he thought could be valuable in different aspects and domains. Giving them enough that they were excited to participate, but not enough that they were shaded. There's a lot of latent demand including from us and other insiders. So I think he feels like he's probably got a pretty good pipeline of existing insiders, let alone new people that are excited by what he's doing and the niche he's filling. The other important thing he did that really gave us a lot of confidence was the hiring rate. I don't know if it's like 9 for 10 or 19 for 20. Every single person that he tried to hire very early on when we just did the seed round was like, ""Yes, I'm leaving SpaceX."" ""Yes, I'm leaving Blue Origin and I want to join you."" And they had seen the problem firsthand, which for us was this huge vote of confidence. Chris: I would also say on the capital side, what people don't understand is Hadrian is expensive to fund until we get up to about 50 million in revenue. And then we don't need another dollar of capital. And I'll tell you why. It's because, even in our, not perfect equipment financing terms right now, the term is shorter than we are obviously going to get even in a depressed cycle. The interest rate is high. Once we get 12 months down the track, we know for a fact that the term doubles. The interest rate might not double, but the term is actually more important. Right now, even on those slightly shitty terms, assuming a machine is at 60% capacity, which is not a hard leap of faith to make, we're a positive free cash flow per month by something like 10 grand. Which is not great, but you add in two or three very easy operational efficiency moves that are highly believable, not boondoggle, ""Hey, we're going to invent this new thing and it might work."" You get two out of three of those and you get $40, $50 million revenue line at the company level, all of a sudden we just print free cash flow.It's going to be hard to fund and kind of painful for the next two or three years while we get to that level but then after that, the numbers just make sense at a certain level, and it's not based on, ""Hey, we have to execute these 20 really hard things."" Once we've got the base in, there's two or three levers to pull where it starts to make a lot of sense. And then all of a sudden we have this scalable system that we can roll out and the business starts looping in on each other. So the way I think about it is, current market aside, you have a corporate burn of something like 25 million a year of software engineers, yada yada yada. And you can basically leave that flat. And then the factory starts to become really efficient. After that, what is scaling is the equipment financing and the factories, which most of that cost is capex of the machines, which can be pushed off to equipment financing. The factory itself is not that expensive, it's the equipment. But we're turning that from a capex cost to an opex cost just on a free cash flow basis. And it's secured against the machines, it's not an IPO or anything against the business. So it's going to be hard to fund and painful and all this other stuff until we're at that level but then after that, we have very clear line of sight to an absolute monster of a company.",4342
86,"Josh Wolfe, Chris Power - Factories of the Future",Hadrian's Operating and Go-To-Market Strategies," Patrick: There's this interesting concept comparing technology companies that are platforms versus applications or infrastructure versus applications. Where if your infrastructure, you want it to be very general purpose. You want anyone that comes to precision machine something with you to be able to do it, but you also have to go to market. Like serve a first customer. And in the app world, of course you're supposed to be really narrow when you're starting. How do you think about that? Breadth of ability versus focus and execution and actually selling parts to actual buyers early on. Chris: Part of that is, and Josh was alluding to this in terms of other companies in this space trying to do everything all at once. Firstly manufacturing is usually complicated and a bit of that east coast, west coast ego makes you want to do every material, every process initially. And we just focused, we're just doing aluminum. We're just doing aluminum milling. What that buys us is ... firstly, don't get me wrong. That is incredibly painfully difficult to pull off in itself. But depending on the space or defense customer it's 30% to 80% of their parts by volume that they're pushing into the supply chain. For satellite companies it's a lot more. For rocket companies it's about half half. For defense companies where it's mostly engines, it's almost not at all. But there's enough of that chunk in terms of billions and billions of dollars in revenue and demand that we get to build this factory market fit, which meets that. What we're laser focused on right now is making that thing hum, so it's operational, it's scalable, it's repeatable and we can ignore it at an R&D level so that we can move the R&D resources onto harder metals, different types of machining, all that other stuff. It's a front running of trade. So it's like, ""Well, what are all the engineers making?What's the Venn diagram of alloy and envelope size and how are we right sizing to that so that we're making this bet across the next 12 months that the capital we deployed is going to be able to serve enough customers in that wedge, that we're going to be able to get a revenue target without having to do a lot of manual stuff, to just make a steel part, to get over the line or whatever?"" It is the more painful process, but it's the only way that you ever get a system that actually scales itself like a data center or a SaaS company versus continually doing all these onesie twosies off to the edges, which continually cause this janc or whatever. It's a really painful thing because we push back on customers. I spend a lot of my time coaching people saying, ""Hey, we're doing this right now. Here's the roadmap for the next 12 months. Here's what 18 months looks like. Feed us all of this now."" We're going to say no to a lot of stuff and that's a really painful dance because we're going to be hitting revenue targets while also staring at all these purchase orders that we have the team to make that stuff that's still going to be profitable, but laser focusing on the thing that we have to get super right and scalable first before moving onto this. It's a very hard dance to do psychologically, but that's a lot of the trick. Patrick: Josh, what lessons have you learned generally, like if entrepreneurs come to you and ask you this focus versus breadth question? What is the interesting nuance that you've come to appreciate watching a lot of companies go to market, especially in the world of harder technology or cutting edge technology? What advice would you give people out there as they think through this? I don't know what to call it, the boil the ocean or the focus problem, or ... it seems like everyone has the vision for five years and it's the path or sequencing to get there that is the really hard part. What advice could you offer them? Josh: You know that I am biased towards what I call randomness and optionality. And the only reason that you ever truly need to focus is because you are running out of time or you are running out of money. We do everything from biotech to space. If you were a biotech company, you had a ton of money in the past few years, you had 10 different programs in a platform because that's a nice a-priority admission that we don't know which one's going to work. Today capital is scarce. It means time is running out. You got to cut 10 of those programs or nine of those programs and you're left with one that you've made a bet on. That bet may or may not pay off and it might have been the right or wrong one, you have no idea. Maybe you do have some instinct.I just generally feel that the more capital and the more time you can have, the more options you have and you can make reversible decisions. It is true in life. It's true whether you're in a biotech company or you're in a platform engineering company for semiconductors. You just want to have as many shots on goal as possible, just like in a portfolio. Now, when you strike gold, when you see that a customer is delighted and satisfied and you have some competitive advantage, then you want to go deep. It's the same sort of thing in investing. When you have high conviction, we want to put more money into our winners. You want to become more concentrated. But when you have high uncertainty and you don't know, you want to try as many experiments as possible. High optionality to begin with. In order to have high optionality, you need time. In order to get time, you need money. And then once you strike gold, and that could be through effortful analysis, it could be through luck, then you want to get concentrated and double down. Patrick: If we do a little transited property, one of the interesting things that's happening I guess is the cost of experimentation has just gone up along with the cost of capital. Is that bad? Can you pass the value judgment on that? Chris: I have a good thing that I coach deep tech founders on. Because deep tech is so often capital heavy and R&D heavy, in a SaaS company, you've got a bunch of backend, front end software engineers where it's largely the same technical domain. So if you need to pivot segment, the market changes, the direction changes, but you've got a product skill set, you've got a SaaS skillset, which is pretty transferable. So as an organization, you can do this Eric Riesling startup thing and snake through to iterate your way to product market fit. With deep tech, in any company, what you're doing is hiring a very specific set of engineers that are good at one thing, but basically can't build another thing. And you're making all these heavy two year bets both on hiring, burn rate and capex and you're pushing in one direction.So the amount of moves you can take, if you're wrong on that direction is, you can go left or right by 20%. You can't snake through the maze. You have to go first principles from the start, set the ship off in a direction and hope to God you hit Hawaii on the other side, because you don't have that. What I tell deep tech founders is basically all of the advice you've been given about lean startups is completely wrong because you're in a completely different thinking and bets type of domain. The only way to do it is basically, spend a year going first principles on everything, check the edges of all your assumptions and then throw $20 million in that direction and hope to God and hit the island. Anything less than that, basically doesn't work unless you're in a weird domain like satellites, where maybe if you're good at making satellites, but instead of selling comms data, you're selling some other telemetry sort of a thing, but that's a rare situation. Josh: The answer to a related question, which is: If the cost of experimentation has gone up, which I believe it has just because the cost capital has gone up, timeframes have come in, these far out 20-year projects became these 20-month frenzied ventures, that is going to change, but do you get more or less innovation when the cost of capital is high or low? My answer is neither. It doesn't matter. When the cost of capital is low, you get a million experiments being tried and statistically, most of them are going to fail. Whether it's Sturgeon's Law or whatever you want to call it, let's say 90% of them end up crap. 10% are going to survive, whether by deserved success or selection or total luck or charismatic CEO that pushed it through by force of nature. But of the 90% that fail, that becomes the detritus that's the combinatorial fodder for the next wave. It has happened in every cycle where the stuff that didn't work, somebody cleverly looks and says, ""Wait a second. I can pick that stuff up from that their junkyard and combine it with this other thing and suddenly I've got something that's more valuable."" When the cost of capital, conversely is very high, then only super discriminating things get funded.But I can tell you right now, going back to that sort of anti-bubble thing, there are ton of things that were effectively science projects inside of large tech companies with brilliant teams who were given money and what normally would've been like, oh, your 20% time to tinker, became these little projects and they're going to get spun out by groups like us and others that basically see that there's value there. We'll fund the losses. We think that they're really competitively advantaged. It's the kind of thing that we never would've funded ourselves from the get go because it would've taken too much time or too much money, but somebody else funded it and they may just not get paid for the risk that they took. I think there's going to be a lot of those opportunities. Cost of capital's high. Cost of capital's low. Doesn't matter. In the former case, you're picking up the commentorial fodder and spinning things out. In the latter case, million experiments are getting tried and statistically a handful will survive Chris: In a low cost of capital environment where there's too much capital, you're making a bunch of bets, but the execution on the ground floor is really sloppy. The cost of making the bet with a low cost of capital is much higher, because a bunch of people are hiring software engineers when they could have done with two and they do with five. The other thing is, this is what I think we've seen over the last three or four years, which is why I keep going on rants about people trading cat pictures on the internet for millions of dollars while society's collapsing around them. If you get these capital stacks and people are simultaneously inventing the product, inventing the customer, inventing the user, because of the capital flood, you might think you're making a bet and you're seeing traction and that bet is paying off, but the signal is so distorted from all these capital flows that you can say that there's more bets in abundant capital environment, but they're not good bets because the signal is so wonky. Patrick: Chris, if you think back to that fat startup versus lean startup concept, you were talking about, what was the most difficult part of that for you and Hadrian? Obviously, if you're coaching others on this process, you've been through it yourself. When you were doing that year long period or whatever, what was the hardest irreversible decision that you made and how did you make it? Chris: The irreversible one I think is location, because you're assigning yourself up to a center of gravity in a talent pool. The bet that I made was we're going to be able to pull enough software engineers down to LA where the customers are. That that's a better bet than trying to build a factory in San Francisco. That is truly, truly irreversible. In terms of difficulty, the way I think about starting businesses is that the market of the universe is actually very efficient and the economist's were right that the supply and demand curve meets, but that the way we measure it just in finance is incomplete. A good entrepreneur seeks arbitrage all over the place. In an environment like Hadrian, where people ask me all the time, ""How do you know what the margins are? How do you know all these machine shops? How do you know what the supply chain issues are six layers deep in this defense environment where it's unclear to everyone else?""The answer is, because I've been in sales before, and I have this weird thing where I can face up to a lot of psychological pain. I can cold call a thousand plant managers and discover all this information and no one else can, but that is part of the efficient market. No one else can do it. I just happen to have a gene that makes me slightly psychotic in these things. That's hard for me, but I know how to do it. It's the same as body building. You could be genetically predispositioned to put on a lot of muscle, but unless you're that type of person that actually really enjoys lifting the same weight over and over again at slightly increasing increments, then you're going to fail. This is the sort of market where you have to really love schlep work. That's not necessarily hard for me, but anyone doing deep tech with these undiscovered bits of knowledge, you have to really enjoy the grind of going bottoms up on stuff and discovering things that no one else wants to. The information is not Google. You have to go get. Patrick: There's this great Paul Graham idea from one of his early essays that if someone overweight is chasing you should run upstairs, not down them. All of a sudden the relative game matters a lot. That idea of schlep work I'm really interested in. Josh, do you find that? Is it a good signal if a company has to endure in its future, a lot more schlep work than less? Josh: I think it's predictive of probability of success. Things that are hard that people are able to persevere through, I think we're going to see a lot of that in the coming years, predictive of survivorship, which survival is a necessary precondition for growth. But there are some people that get lucky and don't really have to suffer pain and thrive just as much.",3156
87,"Josh Wolfe, Chris Power - Factories of the Future",Thoughts on the Future of Hadrian," Patrick: I would love to close with a bookend pair from each of you of questions about the future through this lens of what's being built at Hadrian and the related industries. If we think about a really ugly and a really bright future, I'd love you to describe the things that you would think about in those two futures. The necessary conditions for the bright future, the things you might stay up at night worrying about for the not so bright future. Chris, may be starting with you. How do you think about that spectrum and what defines its edges? Chris: A really bright future looks something like US wins space race two, the CCP gets put back in their place. We solve all these supply chain issues then we can build the Jetson's future, or as Josh calls it, taking science fiction into science fact. Ultimately, where we are at as a country in my view, I think about what is the root cause of problems all the time. You can say that they're supply chain. You can say that they're technological. You can say that there's all these issues, but at its core, there are many, many people in all these fundamental industries that make society go that are no longer serious about doing their jobs in society. What I mean by that is, the reason why you can sit on a laptop creating crypto stuff is because there's this whole structure of society behind you, where someone fixes your alarm, someone comes and puts out the fire of your apartment, someone built the DoorDash, there's farmers making food. There's all this infrastructure of society that enables us to work on all this cool stuff. As a country we've failed to generate the culture. Jewish society does this incredibly well. There are constant rituals and reminders of, you have to reinforce and remind people and the new generation that what built the successful country has to be maintained. It's not for free.The most crisp definition that I've found of this, which me and Catherine Boyle agree on, is that the American populace in general has turned from a bunch of serious people to a bunch of unserious people where, because we've had so much success, they don't realize that these things matter anymore. We're about to go through a rude awakening of that. This is why I think the cost of an iPhone is going to be this real trigger in the American mind of like, ""Oh shit, I can't just eat the bugs and click the laptop anymore. This stuff actually matters."" Success for me looks like, and this is what we want to fulfill through Hadrian, is can we be a beacon of financial success fixing a really hard problem for customers in the country, but we have this culture of seriousness about the mission and the purpose, which I hope radiates out and reminds people that none of this is for free and working on hard problems is not just this funny VC thing, it's if we don't have a culture in America that people in manufacturing or people in operations or people working in deep technology are as respected as people in finance or working on esoteric software problems, then the culture and what we produce is upstream of solving all of these problems. The main one is that we've got a bunch of people in leadership seats all across, where for some reason they're unserious people and they haven't been maintaining the structures that made this country successful in the first place. We really have to realize that is the most important possible thing that we could work on. Patrick: What do you mean by serious in this context? What does that word mean? Chris: Serious means we are all running a town together. Josh is the security guard. You're the guy that cooks the food and I'm the guy that hunts the animals, right? Josh: Can I just object to that assignment of roles? Chris: What I mean by that is, in that very simple example, you all know at a tribal level that if we don't all perform our roles, we're very quickly back to, we're all hunting or we're all fighting over food. In the winter solstice, we're all getting hammered at the local tavern on a Friday, all bets are off, we're friends, like whatever. But when we are performing those societal roles, we are serious about them. Now what unserious looks like is ... I'll give you a really practical example. The fire hydrant goes out outside the factory the other day, because some guy hits it with a car. So our head of operations calls the water company and they say, ""Oh, it's the fire company's problem. Call the fire company."" And they say, ""No, it's the water company's problem."" There's all this finger pointing. It's not my problem. It's this guy's. It's this guy's. Right now, I'm fighting with the California state government to get more power connected to the factory.It's turning into this ridiculous 20-person Kafka game of, you fill out a form and yada yada yada, and it's completely insane. It's all downstream of this attitude of, yeah, we're all living in this society. We can party together or whatever, but unless you are dead serious about performing the intent of your role in the scaffolding of this country that we've built, then everything falls apart. Everything falls apart, because ultimately there's a hundred layers of society that we've built downstream from the military protecting us, to people building up food, energy, electricity, all this other stuff. If you have people in those seats that are performing processes, but are not taking their dedication to the function that they perform in society seriously, it collapses very, very, very quickly. If that makes sense. Patrick: What an awesome answer. Josh, what is your same conception of this spectrum and what defines its edges? Josh: Something that Chris said, which I happen to agree with and I'll put it in different terms is the sort of shirt sleeves to shirt sleeves in two generations. The fact that prior success has allowed complacency from a younger generation. I don't think there was a more controversial tweet I've put out in recent times than recounting a friend who was hiring somebody that showed up eight minutes late. They called the front desk and said, ""Well, what time did they check in the front desk?"" And it was five minutes late. There was no excuse. There was no apology given. Half the people were 10 minutes early. You're on time. On time. You're late. 10 minutes late. You're fired. The other half were like, ""Oh my God, this particular candidate dodged a bullet, what kind of horrible boss?"" I just couldn't imagine the great generation, the kind of people that were actually making things, ever showing up late and thinking that was okay. There's a sense of complacency, entitlement. Some of that is a natural function of excess. You've had people today between 22 and 37 years old, looking back at the last downturn 15 years that have really never experienced the downturn have never really experienced down rounds in companies, hardship, et cetera. Watched wars, sort of war porn on YouTube and news, but haven't really experienced the need to serve and suffer in a very long time. So there's an element of that. There's also a natural understandable trend towards complexity where you go back to 1958, the Leonard Reed essay of ""I, Pencil"" manifests today with any of the objects around us. No one person can really articulate the simplest objects, let alone the most complex ones and our objects have only gotten more complex. But the complexity of those objects in turn lead to competitive advantage on the global stage.Much of a thrust of what we're focused on is making sure that we're finding the most cutting edge, crazy technology to put in the hands of war fighters to defend us so that we can go and live a life full of trivialities and comfort that you see today in the very giant, to put it in the Ishiguro book about the rise again of a war of long forgotten, that we see with revanchist Russia invading Ukraine and suddenly saying, ""Wait a second, there are good people and bad people. There are bad actors. Lives can be uprooted and put in threat."" Some of it is the race that Chris is helping to fuel and that starts with a space race and starts with aerospace and defense. I think it'll trickle out into a whole bunch of other industries as people start to reshore certain manufacturing, imagine new capabilities. Something you described earlier, when Andrel is designing a part, thinking about the modularity of how that same part can be used in four different systems that many people will say, ""Oh, that's an interesting part."" And artistically take that and put it into something else. There's a moral dimension. Chris talks about it. I talk about it. About not being anti-Chinese at all, but being anti-CCP and authoritarian regime and what that means for society as influence grows. It's interesting, when I started talking about Hadrian to some of our friends, two people who I hold in super high regard, both send me the same book within two weeks of each other. It was this book I'm holding it up here for you. Freedom's Forge. It's the story of World War II, how our industrial base was basically mobilized and in the course of four years helped to create the American war machine. Patrick: Incredible. Yeah. Josh: I just think that that capability, which for the past generation was effectively outsourced in understandable sense of peace and a quest for ever increasing profit margins, but eroded a domestic capability that was a historic competitive advantage. People like Chris and Hadrian are going to help us return to that so that we can be technologically advantaged and let a thousand flowers bloom and just rebuild this American base. Patrick: Chris, would you hire someone that showed up 10 minutes late to an interview? Chris: We have, but they were on a 50 minute commute and texted me 10 minutes saying, ""Hey, the GPS is just blown out. There's an accident."" In a situation like that, absolutely. If it's the frivolous type of situation that Josh described where it's just like, ""Eh, I'm six minutes late to an interview."" Absolutely not. I actually think that's the perfect definition of, you're running a serious company as this entrepreneur being late to things like that is a strong signal this person is not serious about building something. Patrick: The ownership and responsibility, and maybe even duty that's underneath some of your answers, it's just super interesting to me, and that also it's good for the person executing those things. That ultimately you feel much better when you do have those senses of ownership and responsibility. This is a dimension that I don't think I've ever talked about on the show. I really, really like closing in this area. I just think it's so interesting and very appropriate for the environment that we've entered geopolitically from a capital market standpoint. Batten down the hatches focus, work hard. I think is a wonderful closing sentiment. Chris, I've already done this with Josh a number of times. He's answered this question probably too many times for me, but I haven't done it with you. I get to ask you my traditional closing question. What is the kindest thing that anyone's ever done for you? Chris: This is the beautiful thing about this country. I would say that there is three to four people that in the first three weeks that I moved to America and San Francisco, through no other reason than kindness, took me under their wing and helped me navigate what I wanted to do. That without them, I would not be here and none of this would be here. There was no financial motivation to it. There was no nothing. It was just a pure, ""Hey, you seem like a nice guy. You're trying to do something. Let me help on all fronts."" There's less than five people that were directionally so important to my life and where we are today. Patrick: It feels as though we need to do one of these with the three of us every two, three years or something to check in on the progress of what you're building. Really excited to watch it happen and unfold. Chris and Josh, thanks so much for your time.This site uses cookies to improve your browsing experience.

88,"Martin Casado - The Past, Present, and Future of Digital Infrastructure",Introduction," Patrick: My guest today is Martin Casado. Martin is a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, where he focuses on digital infrastructure. Before joining a16z, Martin pioneered software defined networking and co-founded Nicira, which was bought by VMware for $1.3 billion in 2012. Martin has studied, built and invested in digital infrastructure his whole career, and is the perfect person to discuss the most interesting aspects of the industry. Please enjoy this great conversation with Martin Casado.",109
89,"Martin Casado - The Past, Present, and Future of Digital Infrastructure",The State of Digital Infrastructure," Patrick: So Martin, I think we might call this episode, the past, present, and future of digital infrastructure, which is the world that lives beneath all the stuff we all spend all our days using, and probably almost no one's ever really thought about, but represents enormous markets in terms of revenue, market cap. People have heard of things like AWS, et cetera. I'd love to begin by you giving us a state of the union of digital infrastructure today. The major aspects of it that you think are more important. I like starting in the present, then maybe we'll jump to the past. But if you had to describe this to a new initiate into this part of the business world, how would you describe it and its importance? Martin: The primary narrative for the last decade has been the cloud. You have basically an oligopoly of three providers, Microsoft, Google, and AWS. They provide all of IT, which used to be provided by central IT teams. It used to be the case that you would have these IT teams and they'd rack servers, they'd provide services, and now this stuff's just available online. And not only is the compute, the storage and network, which are traditional infrastructure, but higher level services on top of those. Today, if you're going to build an app, you don't have to know a lot about infrastructure. You don't have to rack servers, you don't have to know about how to build a database. You just use those and then you focus more on the business logic. Patrick: How would you put chapter headers on the stages of cloud adoption, going back to, I think, Azure and AWS, are sort of mid-2000, 2005, 2006, thereabouts, relatively speaking, a short story. What do you think the major eras of the cloud story have been so far? Martin: Right before the cloud, of course, everybody ran their own internal IT. Right? And so they kind of write their own servers and their own wiring closets. The cloud showed up and the early usage was what you would typically find in a technology early adopter ecosystem. It's more new projects and startups and hobbyists, the average workloads were relatively small. There was exceptions to that of course, like Netflix is a very famous one, which went all in the cloud very early. But in general, that was what it was. This is like 2005-2010 timeframe and still was very experimental. A lot of the time there was big discussions on whether the enterprise would actually go into the cloud. When I ran network and security for VMware, which is 2012-2016 timeframe, I think that was the more mainstream adoption of the cloud. You saw large organizations, traditional enterprise moving workloads to the cloud, very serious discussion with the Fed and the government. It became a mainstream way of doing things. If you were a large organization and you didn't have a cloud strategy, I mean, you were either considered a laggard or a special case. That brings us to 2018-2019, and now we're seeing a shift where the move to the cloud has implications on your finances, because now instead of you being able to buy a physical asset and internalize that, you're basically paying a portion of your income to a third party.Now there's a lot of discussions around, how do you optimize the use of cloud? Is the right thing to go all in on cloud? Is it something that you do a portion or whatever? I just want to make one quick analogy, which is, I always view companies going in three stages, the product stage, the sales or growth stage, and then the operation stage. The product stage you're finding product market fit. The sales stage is you're getting to repeatable sales and growth. You don't really worry too much about unit economics. And the operation stage is when you care about unit economics and you go into multiple products and you do all the operation of complex things. The cloud had gone through the exact same three phases, which first was trying to find product market fit, which tended to be within new projects, funding the projects. Then it went to the growth phase where everybody went all in and didn't worry about the implications to the economics of business. Now we're at the operations phase where we're starting rationalize all of that.",931
90,"Martin Casado - The Past, Present, and Future of Digital Infrastructure",Case Studies on Public Cloud Computing," Patrick: Maybe tell the story of Dropbox, which I think as an individual company, is a great example of cloud isn't just some panacea. It has incredible benefits in terms of how quickly you can get going, outsource the reliability to somebody else that's just focused on this, AWS or whatever. But from a cost standpoint, it can get really out of hand. I think Dropbox is a good and probably unfamiliar to most tale of going the other direction. Martin: There's basically two trends that happen at the same time. It's important to understand those two trends to understand what happened at Dropbox and actually a number of other companies too, it's not just Dropbox. The two trends are the following, the first one is cloud, which we talked about. The second trend is SaaS. And specifically what's unique to SaaS is, is before if you were a software vendor, you would build software and you'd ship software, and somebody else would run it on their own infrastructure. Your COGS, your cost of goods as a software vendor did not include the infrastructure that it was being run on, because it was being run on somebody else's infrastructure. For example, my startup, we built software for networking, we shipped it, other people would run it on their infrastructure. However, if your SaaS, if your product is software as a service, then part of your cost of goods is actually the infrastructure. Someone comes, says, ""I've got a SaaS site and someone comes and uses it, then they pay me some, and then I pay say, AWS a portion of that."" That is a change of cost structure. The books look very different.While the cloud is getting adopted, all software is going from basically on-prem to SaaS, and in some cases, and there's many of these cases, it turned out that it was very tough to get software margins just because the cost of the cloud services on the backend was so high. The era of shipping software, we'd all say these companies have 80% margins because you basically write the code once and then it's free to copy bits, so you just ship it to everybody else. Especially in infrastructure, there's many companies that felt like they're basically reselling a thin layer on top of AWS or one of the big clouds, and then paying a large portion back to them. For example, I know multiple companies that are household names, where they've got product lines that have 0% margins because all of the money goes back to the cloud services it's hosted on. Dropbox very famously had this situation where S3, which is the storage layer on Amazon is not optimized for this use case of many small objects. They found that they were paying a tremendous amount. Now, they were a very large user of this specific use case. AWS was not optimized for it. They decided to build their own internal infrastructure and probably saved the company at the time, by moving off the cloud and taking it internally. Patrick: Literally what they did is built the equivalent of data centers or like an AWS. They were just building some series of places that had the same infrastructure, but they controlled and it was optimized for their use case. Martin: Dropbox is an often used example. It's a very specific use case and things to highlight is, there's a subset of the workload. Like, listen, if you're just doing a webpage, it doesn't make sense to do your own infrastructure. If you're adjusting some kind of vertical SaaS, that's not compute heavy, it doesn't. But many workloads, let's say if you're doing music serving, a lot of data intensive stuff, especially if you're one of the world's largest websites, then you may have a certain workload amongst all of your workloads where optimization really matters. This is the case of Dropbox. What they did is they noticed for the storage, that Amazon AWS was not optimized for their use case. It was a large compute workload. Then they built their own infrastructure to support that. Their own data centers, their own servers, and then their own software on the backend in order to do that. But again, it's not like the entire company moved over there. It was specific workloads that they moved over. Patrick: There was a really interesting thing that you wrote about the interesting concept of lost market cap of companies that were big users of the public clouds. I'd love you to walk through that concept, because you mentioned maybe this saved Dropbox, the company, and I get that that's a very special, specific case, but it sounds like there's a bigger story here of lost margin and therefore lost market cap because of the use of public cloud. I'd love you to walk us through that. Martin: We did this analysis, a very simple analysis, which we said, ""Okay, right now there's a tremendous amount of money that SaaS companies spend on cloud."" Let's say if they brought it inside and they were able to drop those costs by half, which most people agree that you can drop the costs by half by bringing it inside. If you could do that, what would that do to the stock price? Normally when people look at this problem, they say, ""Well, if you bring this inside, yes, it'll save you money. You'll save 50%, but that money won't cover the team, the complexity, because that's not a lot of money."" But if you look at the leverage that increase in margin does to the stock price, now you can free up for a large company, potentially a lot of money, which will flow over to cash, so it could be a big win.What we learnt is that we looked at just public software companies. We looked at 50 of them. We looked at all of their spend and we said, ""Let's assume you cut that spend in half."" Then we calculated their margins. And then we said, ""Benchmarking against other public companies, if their margins were half, what would that do to the stock price?"" It turned out that it would increase in aggregate the stock price by $200 billion. Just a tremendously high number. I think we wrote $100 billion to be conservative in the actual blog post, but $200 billion. That means if you're a company that's say, worth $10 billion, and you can reduce your COGS by a bit, you could now become worth $14 billion, and then you have access to that for debt and hiring or whatever else. Because those two trends happened at the same time you had the cloud trend, as well as the SaaS trend, I don't think there had been a lot of focus on what it does to the margin structure. We did the first analysis and said, ""Actually it's huge and it can impact your stock price."" I do think, especially now in this market correction, it's a good thing for companies to start looking at. Patrick: I think Netflix was one of the very famous early adopters of this public cloud infrastructure. I love the evolution of product to sales to operations. It seems like right now, given what's happening in public equities at least, that every company is going to be looking for ways to save money. Do you think this becomes a huge headwind for the three public cloud providers, that everyone's going to say, ""Wait a minute, if we can do that consolidation, this is the time to do it?"" Martin: The three big cloud providers are going to continue to grow and continue to preserve margins. And the reason is the following, we're still in relatively early endings for the cloud and there's a lot of workloads that should be in the cloud that are not, that are going to continue to move there. I also think a lot of the companies that can benefit the most from these already have very much sweetheart pricing for historical reasons, so they've got a lot of pricing power. I think even if they do move certain workloads off the cloud, I don't think that the margin impact is going to be as significant, just because I don't feel like a lot of the margin comes from those.By the way, there's one more trend I think that we should also talk about, which is, you had the cloud and then you had SaaS, but there's also been the evolution of things like Kubernetes or technologies that enable you to run on clouds, in between clouds, that's also matured. That's also matured to a point now that makes it easier for folks to run their own infrastructure and move between clouds. I do think we're at a point that companies will now have honest discussions, like, should portions of our workloads be run on third party clouds, on the big three, on our own infrastructure? They'll have that discussion. There is the technology for them to do it. There's enough proof points of it happening that they can have the discussion. And we'll start to see that optimization, but I don't think that the workloads that are going to be impacted, let's say in the next five years, are going to be the ones that are primary margin drivers for the big three. I really don't.",1983
91,"Martin Casado - The Past, Present, and Future of Digital Infrastructure",The Biggest Innovations This Cycle," Patrick: Before we get to something like Kubernetes, a little bit more complicated of a topic, I'd love to just return to super basics around digital infrastructure in the first place. And maybe even go all the way back to the original AWS website, where I think it was storage, compute, database. You mentioned networking. What are the base level, most primitives of the digital world? What are the most important, big things that actually happen? Because I'd love to understand what's changed in those areas, like compute sounds like compute. What is changing in those three, four, five base level areas? Martin: The traditional infrastructure's computing and storage, and then databases. Prior to cloud, you'd buy a server from whatever, Dell or IBM or HP. You'd buy a switch from Juniper or Cisco. You'd buy a storage array from whoever, EMC. And databases from Oracle. So all those have now been, basically, collapsed into a software layer over basically merchant hardware in the cloud. So you can get the equivalent of just compute by TC2. You can get very flexible networking layers, where you can put security policies and that's largely implemented in software within the cloud. And then you get these scalable services, like the database services that are scalable because they're in the cloud. And so that's the bread and butter of the cloud.For a cloud is basically you take these traditional abstractions, compute and storage, that were connected to a box and now they're just basically software services that you can spin up and they should be able to grow to the size of the workload. But what has also happened in the last say, five years is a number of services then built on top of those that are higher level abstractions. So for example, machine learning workflows, analytic workflows, different types of databases that focus on different types of query patterns. I want to do analytics, or I want to do LTP, or I want to do very fast queries or time series. We have seen this renaissance of infrastructure, again, which used to be tied to a box now being implemented as a software services in a way that's much faster than we've seen historically for that exact reason. That it's not confined to a box. Patrick: In terms of just like, what literally is happening in those three key original areas, how much innovation has there been? And maybe it's like a Moore's law question or something. How much has that evolved on a unit basis, and how can we expect it to continue to get better or evolve? Martin: I think we've entered somewhat of a dark ages for infrastructure innovation. And the reason I say that is just because it's become so consolidated into three companies who keep it so under wraps that the rest of the industry just doesn't enjoy it, or just doesn't have as much access to it. So, for example, when's the last time you saw big innovation in servers? You know, and I still think there's a lot of great work to do there. Just so dominated by the big three. The same thing I would say with networking. So much of this has been consolidated by the data centers and driven by that one vision. I think this stands to reason as you have this aggregation phase where like a few companies drive probably 50% of the infrastructure market. You know, just something enormous.However what's happening is we hit this operations space like you and I spoke about. Users of the cloud are starting to evaluate, ""Where can I get benefits that are outside of the cloud? Are there other, maybe not part of the big three companies that provide something interesting?"" So we're just starting to see glimmers of innovation again in traditional infrastructure stuff like compute network and storage. And so we can talk about that. I think it's actually very interesting to talk about, is now we're starting to see the innovation come back out of the cloud and be exposed to more. So we're entering again, this cycle of innovation. Patrick: How will that happen? It's like up against a death star or something. Like facing these three big companies. What do you think the best entrepreneurs will do? Pick something like crazy specific and just go after a single thread? How do you think this innovation cycle will happen? Martin: All of these companies are like, very strong repeat founders and the companies are Mighty, Fly Out IO and Mosaic. So, what do these companies do? So Mighty is browser as a service. I don't know about you, but right now even as we speak, I probably have 30 tabs in my browser. My laptop goes slow. If you use Mighty all of that's offloaded and you get this crazy good experience, which is great for most of us, especially as the browser gets more workloads. What is Fly? Fly allows any developer to run compute workload at the CDN tier all across the world, which is important if you care about responsiveness to the users. And what is Mosaic? Mosaic is, basically machine learning as a service. So they provide the ability to run models very quickly for AI specific loads. So, what's unique about all three of these companies is all of them are doing their own hardware. They're looking to run servers, they're racking and stacking. And these are very, very strong founders.All of them are repeat founders and all of these companies have great traction. So what is happening here? I think it's exactly what we've spoken about, which is there just are across the industry certain workloads that, if you look at that very specific workload, the cloud is just not optimized for them. And that provides room for the Mighty and Mosaics and Flies of the world to provide something that is a very attractive proof point or performance point or whatever it is, with respects to the clouds. And so I don't think the answer is we're going to see a lot of drop boxes, where the end customer builds their own data center. I do think we are seeing very concrete signs of third party companies coming in and providing cloud services that are just at a much better price point, or a much better performance point, or much more optimized for a workload. And because the cloud is growing to size, there's enough market now for solvent companies to do these. And so I think this is the very beginning, again, of a much bigger trend.",1381
92,"Martin Casado - The Past, Present, and Future of Digital Infrastructure",Building API and Open Source-First Companies," Patrick: Can you say a bit about your view of what I'll call API first companies? Which I think a lot of people would include in this definition of digital infrastructure. If I can hire Stripe to be my payments processor by simply inserting a API into my software that I build and care about. And then there's one of these APIs that's proliferating for kind of everything. What do you see happening here? Is that infrastructure in your mind? Where does this fit into this equation? Martin: As markets grow, the unit to which you monetize gets more granular. And my favorite example of this, and it's one that may be a cliche but it's worth saying, is the car market. So, way back when in 1913, Ford had a factor called the Rouge River Factory. And this factory literally went in on one side, it was like water, rubber and coal. You know, and like iron ore, and what came out on the other side was cars. And the reason is there wasn't a sufficiently large market for cars to actually have suppliers. You couldn't be someone that provided wheels or whatever. And if you look at the car market now, I mean, there's companies that provide nuts and bolts and you've got multiple tiers of OEMs and integrators, et cetera, et cetera.So the same thing has happened to systems historically. So in the 1970s, the same company would build literally the chip, the motherboard, the sheet metal, the operating system of all the apps. And then of course the OS got disaggregated from the hardware and then the apps got disaggregated from the OS. So now what's happening is the application itself is being disaggregated. You take any application, you blow it up and assume the market for this application or any application is so big that independent component of applications now can become companies.So what does an application do? I mean, applications authenticate users, they need access controls, they need to send emails, they need to do payments. These are things that all applications can do. So it's almost like every help or library in an application is now becoming a company. So much so that I remember even five years ago, you drive up 101, the heart of Silicon valley in the Bay area, and you'd have billboards where the entire company was an API. PubNub, Sendgrid, you know, Twilio. And so this is a major movement where now you don't have to build a business app to build a company. And for an infrastructure person, this is super exciting because most of the founders I invest in are technical founders that are providing technical functions that are only useful to developers. And in the past, it was hard to build a business that way, but now you absolutely can.If you're in tech at all, or you're an investor at all, I definitely think you should look at an application and assume that any sub-component does have the potential to now become a company, because the market is just so large. Patrick: What stage of that process do you think we are in? Twilio and Stripe, everyone knows turns out payments and sending messages. It's almost like the equivalent of storage and compute in application building. Where do you think we are in that process? Martin: I think we're still pretty early. I mean, on average, an application uses 17 external APIs. I think like a mobile app, something like that. But if you look at the use of libraries and open source and everything else, it's still incredibly high for people having to integrate external components and management operate themselves. I think that there's still a long way to go, especially as we get into kind of more complex things. So for example, every application often requires some sort of internal policy. Who can access what, or you know? And this is a very specific computer science problem. How do you build a language or a policy language that kind of accesses, that allows a third party to declare a set of rules and mitigates access to those rules? Like, this is a component in most programs that can be pulled out and turned into a company. There's a number of companies looking at that, that are just getting started. Patrick: When it comes to this developer facing tooling, there's this open source way of building and there's the more proprietary, closed source way of building. What have you learned about what works well in which domain? And then I'd love to also learn, like if you're an open source company versus not, what is more or less important as you think about product and go to market and everything like that? Martin: I'm starting to be of the opinion that as we move to SaaS and that's the primary way of consuming infrastructure, which it seems to be, that open source matters a lot less. And the reason I say that is, if I'm a developer and I'm writing an application and I need to authenticate my users and I need to authorize their access to things, and I need to send them emails or send them SMS texts or whatever, I have two options. I could download some open source package and then operate that, or I could just use an API that somebody else operates. The secular trend is I'm going to use the API that somebody else operates. And if I'm doing that, whether or not the code for that is open source, doesn't matter that much to me. So let's take the case of it is open source. So, even if it is open source, there is some value there. A lot of actual code to running that service has to do with the operations of the service. Like, how do you make sure that it's high availability? How do you debug it? How do you check for performance? Like, and that operations code is to be very specific to the actual service running. So it isn't even useful.So that would never be open source anyway. So even if I had the source code, I couldn't really use it and operate it in the same way that somebody else could, or is running it. When it comes to dev tools, things that I am specifically using in my program as I develop, like that will always be open source and that's very important. But anything that's functional and offered as a service, I think the actual value of open source decreases. And what raises importance is actually open standards, which is, I still want be able to make sure that I'm not locked in to one and I can move between them, but that's not an open source argument. That's kind of an open standards argument. And so the role of open source has obviously shifted very, very quickly in the last 10 years, largely driven by this consumption with SaaS. And I think that we're getting a more nuanced view of where it's useful and where it's not. Whereas 10 years ago, there was this broad consensus that open source is great and it's going to take over the world. And that just doesn't seem to be the case in the way that we all thought. Patrick: So whether or not a company's open source based or not, what have you learned about successfully building relationships between a company and a big market of developers? Like, it's a very unique market to be marketing to or selling into. There's bottom up, there's top down. There's lots of ways to do it. Just generally, what should we know about developers as a buying class? Martin: This is still very much an early and evolving area. There's a number of truisms that everybody knows, but we're saying. So one of the truisms is developers can have more and more budget. Another truism is that traditional sales and marketing technique don't work for developers. Another truism is developers tend to be very opinionated and have strong identities and tend to create factions that localize around certain types of technologies and so forth. The best companies in developer space have really unlocked what it means to build communities of developers and this creates a tremendous amount of sensitivity to their problems, their workflows, their aesthetics, things like that.So one area I'm personally very interested in is, how do you go from the art, which is develop the relationships, and it's very much an art? There is no rule book for how you do developer sales, even if there are rule books in our work. How do you get more visibility into that? We're seeing a number of interesting companies pop up. Orbit is one that I'm involved with, which like their entire goal is to help companies build developer ecosystems and then have some visibility into those so that it can kind of move more into a traditional motion. Like I said, I haven't been involved in this now for the last while. There's a lot for the industry to learn about that. Patrick: Can you say a little bit about the difference between a front end and backend developer and what you think is changing in that relationship or set of responsibilities? It's an interesting one. Martin: We use the term ""developer"" like there's this generic developer out there, which is not the case. There's a number of ways you can classify them. One way that I think that's particularly useful is the difference between a backend or a front end developer. So, backend developers tend to be like system folks like I used to be. They build big, distributed systems, they build infrastructure. It's less specific business logic. It's almost like a service operation to the front end developers who are building like, the user experience. So the back end is you're building some heavy data platform or compute platform or whatever. And front end developers are actually developing the UI and the logic that's facing the customer.And in the past, the view was the front-end developers was mostly about presentation and user experience, and a lot of the work was backend. What's very interesting is, there's probably, I don't know, 100 frontend developers for every backend developer. So what we're seeing is frontend developers slowly consuming more and more of the stack. And this has broad implications on the type of people that are frontend developers, it has big implications on the type of infrastructure that supports them. The big trend we're seeing is frontend developers are now doing more and more of the application, which has naturally resulted in atrophy of the backend. But that's the distinction that... A very helpful distinction to make. And this one, certainly we make on the investing side, because it does dictate a log of what technologies get adopted where, and who needs what.",2304
93,"Martin Casado - The Past, Present, and Future of Digital Infrastructure",Evaluating Digital Infrastructure Businesses," Patrick: Going back to this notion of, so if they're the consumers of these APIs or little pieces of infrastructure, I absolutely love the Ford factory example, and what happens as it matures, that it's so clean. What do you look for as an investor when you are seeing one of these, let's say API forward or first companies for the first time? What is your method of investigation? How are you processing a new company? Martin: So throughout this all together, we talked about a trend. So there's a lot of frontend developers. We talked about probably 100 to everyone backend. And those frontend developers, they're building more and more of the application. So in the past, they had to... Were very tied to the backend more and more. Instead of having their own backend, they can use it an API from a third party company. Let's say they're using 20 little SMS or whatever. The interesting thing about these API companies that offer to the frontend is that the unit of consumption really is like a function call or an API call. So they almost have these consumer-like dynamics. So the primary evaluation criteria, to answer your question, and why it's so different, in the past, if you're going to evaluate a server company, who's the buyer, what's the go-to market motion, what's the ACV.You talked to a bunch of the buyers, you'd see if they can build the technology, et cetera. Now, with these API companies, you literally just can look at what the usage graphs are, how many users, how do they monetize them, et cetera, and it's become much more of a bottoms-up, or SAS, or consumer type profile. So we stopped a lot of that approach to investing when evaluating these companies. It's much less about can they build it, who's the buyer, and it's much more about how they use it in a practice, then it'd very interesting. A lot of these companies, they do. They've got these beautiful growth patterns, just like you're looking at the next WhatsApp. They really are almost consumer-like phenomena. Patrick: What would be the most common red flags or disqualifying observations if you're investigating one of these companies beyond lack of that nice looking usage or engagement? Martin: Well, I'll tell you what I've gotten wrong. I do come from the older era where you actually evaluate the technology, you have a thesis on go to market. Often, we've seen these companies come in and they've got these beautiful usage graphs. They haven't monetized yet, but we're like, ""Oh well, who's going to pay for this?"" Or this is just developers, like whatever. And then we kind of talk ourselves out of the deal, because we know the market better than the founder. And in almost every case, I've regretted that because the reality is, and this is an internal thesis of ours, is the graph in almost every case is just smarter than our theorying. The market actually knows what it wants.These days, if one of these API companies is doing very well and the usage is great, I'll give you an example, Hugging Face is a phenomenal company. And if you looked early on at the usage, this thing is a rocket ship, and you can have a bazillion theories why you can't monetize the model, and you have a bazillion theories of why their go-to market is going to work. But the reality is the market loves it, it's a great company. For me, it's almost like a counter thing, which is, I do think that this API makes life a lot easier. You don't have to have a grand unified theory about how things work, because you can literally just look at how this thing's being consumed, because the consumptions become so bite-size; you get a lot of early signals. I think it really boils down to... Patrick: It comes down to usage. Martin: Yeah, to usage. Patrick: How should these things be priced? What have you learned about actually building the revenue model around something that looks more usage based? All these examples, AWS, what we started with, these API companies, they tend to be usage-based pricing. So what have you learned about that? Is that the right thing? Do you think that changes? Martin: It feels to me though, apps are for seat pricing, and infrastructure is usage pricing, and that's basically how it is. And if you're in the frontend, you're not doing usage pricing, you better get there. You really have to. And if you're apps, and you can get away from seat pricing, that just seems like that's where you'll end up. I do feel that when it comes to company building, there's a few areas where there's no simple answers. There's a lot of stuff that's systematic, like how do you hire your sales force, it's pretty systematic. How do you create your org is systematic. But one of the things that's just not systematic is pricing. Pricing is actually dictated by the shape of the market and the shape of the product. And it takes months to get it right. I'll give you three mental landmarks, and I think the rest is just actual work.So one of the mental landmarks is pricing is often fixed by the market. And so you should look at the ecosystem and the other types of companies and how they price and I think you should follow that model. For example, if you're building on top of Snowflake, how Snowflake charges is going to be very similar to how the customer expects to buy. And if you're building on top of that, you're going to want to align with that. And I've been in many cases where the companies wanted to innovate on their own pricing model, but the ecosystem alignment just wasn't there. And it was just painful until they had to change. I think another mental landmark is the market will tell you the price over time, but not initially. The less that you have public or the less that you force your opinion on, the better it is. I do think that a lot of early sales discussions is just to figure out pricing, that's what it is. Your goal is to reverse engineer how they think about that. The good news is because the consumption is so much higher on these, and the unit of consumption is lower, it's per API call, there's kind of a lot of room to experiment.",1438
94,"Martin Casado - The Past, Present, and Future of Digital Infrastructure",Breaking Down the Modern Data Stack," Patrick: I'd love to move a little bit into some of the biggest reasons why all of this proliferation is happening, and the modern data world or modern data stack as it's commonly called in the investing circles is one really interesting place to dig in. And everyone's familiar with AI and ML and their importance in applications, and the exciting stuff around DALL·E and GPT-3 and all this kind of stuff. I would love to focus on the infrastructure portion of the modern data stack. Maybe just give us a little bit of a lesson, what is going on here? Why is this a theme with the name? What are the important parts of it? Martin: 10 years ago, the company comes in and they pitched their dog-walking company to you, or whatever. If you would have big questions on whether they could build it, whether it would scale, can they go international, you have lots of questions about their infrastructure. You don't ask those questions anymore because if anybody wants to build a website, even if one that's globally scaled, we've got the technologies to do that. So let's say in the case of dog-walking, let's say I am an investor and 10 companies come in and pitch the dog-walking company to me. In almost every case, the differentiation now between these types of companies has to do with how they handle data. How do I match dog-walkers to dogs? How do I do dynamic pricing? How do I do personalization? How do I run acquisition campaigns? We've moved as an industry to the businesses competing on how they use data, not how well they use software. I think it's a very, very big shift and it's actually very, very real. Again, even in just how we evaluate these companies. And so what we've seen to catch up is this dramatic improvement and maturation of tools to help with that.Because if you look at the use of data in systems, it's very archaic relative to tools we have from software systems. So the modern data stack is just a catchphrase that folks use when it comes to modern tooling to help build these types of systems, ones where you can provide deep insights and real-time insights into running applications. And they're normally split in one of two ways. There's the analytics side, which is generally... Helps with human decisions, having a lot of data and doing dashboard. And then there's the AI/ML side where this becomes part of the application itself and provides real-time decisions. So just to throw out a few names, the modern data side is typically typified in the kind of AIML of the world, like Databricks is a keystone company, and there's an entire ecosystem around that. In the analytics, you've got BigQuery Redshift and Snowflake has tended to be. For ETL, you've got dbt and Fivetran. So these are kind of modern companies using modern approaches around this to address this shift. But it's all converging now. Where it used to be analytics and AI all were separate, they're all converging now. So we're actually seeing, I think one of the greatest battles for technical supremacy playing off right before our eyes in the modern data stack, as the tools mature. Patrick: Maybe to double-click on a couple of examples just to bring them to life, Snowflake is one that we've had Slootman on the show. It's a very popular stock, not just company. Main Street's familiar with it because it's a great business story. So what does something like Snowflake do for its users and why is this unable to explode with the sort of growth that it has? Martin: So before, you just did not have... The industry did not have a solution that was cost effective to throw all your data into. You had to buy tera data or these big data warehouses. They're very expensive, you're buying hardware. And what they did is they basically offered a cloud service which allows you to throw all of your data, and it's cheap enough that you can throw it all there and keep it in there. Snowflake is the independent company, like Redshift from Amazon is larger and started this. Then BigQuery is also a phenomenal company. So all three of these companies provide that. You actually can treat data almost like this resource that you can continue to come back to as an organization or as an application, rather than something that is outside that you've got to process once, because it's so expensive, and then bring in later. Patrick: Are there primitives in this world, maybe it's ETL or something similar to the primitives in the cloud world that we talked about before that you think of as the core use cases or uses or whatever you want to call them? Martin: So on the operational AINL, it's the model where you want your application to be able to make decisions, and those decisions, rather than being something somebody coded, it's the product of analyzing data. Patrick: It's a prediction, the model prediction. Martin: A Model prediction, but importantly, it's based on analyzing data rather than Martine sitting down and writing a number of rules or something like that. And so that's very much primitive and these are used for things like fraud detection, or pricing, all the things that we know of. And then the entire tool change to create that, the entire workflow to create that is becoming a standard primitive. Also, the data pipeline which creates these models. So from the sources of the data, all the way to the workflow to create their models is becoming a primitive. And this is kind of where ELT comes in. You've got these data sources, whether it's cars or old databases or people on websites. That always get synced into the data warehouse, they go through a set of transformation, features are pulled out and then you actually create models based on those. So I think that entire workflow, from data sources all the way to the models being served, are the primitives that are starting to evolve. But very importantly, this is so new, we're all still kind of trying to decide what piece is what, and what categories are going to emerge. And so, we're starting to get the glimpse of a stack forming. Part of our act of diligence every day is to try and figure out how exactly that's coming together. Patrick: We haven't talked at all about security as a pervasive theme or important function across all of this. People understand the importance of security, and it seems like if anything, this is going to be something that gets more and more important as more stuff is put into digital sphere. What has been the history of securing all of this? And what is most interesting to you as an investor as you think about the future of digital security? Martin: Security has always been a very tough one for me, because it's been a very fragmented market... Impacts everything. One thing that's for sure is that security itself is also becoming an API, like we had talked about, and it's becoming something that's endemic to the building of applications. Xero is a great example of this, where authentication is something. We're seeing this for policy, which I meant. We're seeing this for data integrity and data management. So I view the movement very similar to the infrastructure in general, is it's becoming primitive and programs are starting to get stitched in, which is significantly different than what it was in the past, which is almost this afterthought, and it's a box or this application that you put in that watches everything else. I think it's becoming more intrinsic to the industry.",1682
95,"Martin Casado - The Past, Present, and Future of Digital Infrastructure",Exciting Possibilities Offered By Digital Infrastructure," Patrick: And as you think about the ways that all of this intersects with the real world now, which we really haven't talked about. We basically talked about digital infrastructure that leads all the way up to applications at the top end, and the APIs in between and all this great stuff. But it seems also like as we mature, more of this technology will apply to the real world too, whether that's new kinds of hardware, whether that's intersection with physical goods like cars. How do you think about that side of things and maybe the hardware world of technology? Martin: People have a hard time grasping what, let's say, AI and ML concretely provide, because it's such a diluted buzzword. So for everybody that's listening, the important thing to realize is that what modern AI and ML does, which we've never really been able to do before in systems, is take unstructured data, and digitize it, and add it to the typical logic of the program. And we've never been able to do this with vision, like objects out in the real world. We've never been able to do this with natural language in the level of ASCII we can. We've never been able to do this with voice or speech.That technology just hasn't existed and so we've never been able to build the big programs around them. And now we can, and it's a sufficiently different workload that two things happen. First, it pushes software into the realm of the physical world. We can now see things and interact with things. And we're talking quantum leaps of accuracy improvement. It also drives the type of hardware and software that we build, because the workload is so different, right? So we're seeing tons of innovation all the way down to the ASIC level. Mosaic as a company is building a data center focused just on this type of stuff. So I think that this really is a massive impact on infrastructure at large, not just the infrastructure, but also what sorts of applications software can go after. Patrick: It's very cool to consider what all that might mean. I mean like self-driving cars is like the obvious constant example of what computer vision might allow us to unlock. Obviously, cloud had this crazy impact on the services you consume. It's unlocked innovation by reducing friction. As you think about what's going on in the digital infrastructure world, period, what are you most excited about in terms of what it might unlock in the 2020s or over the next decade that maybe we're just starting to think about? Martin: Any problem that human beings go after that's been outside of the realm of software is currently in the realm of software. And this is farming, agriculture, oceanography, you name it. And so I am a tech optimist and tech maximalist. I think that part of our job is to solve problems. It has really been limited to IT, like information. And now I go from IT to just tech. You look at any industry, any industry at all, and I think that it'll be touched by this. That's, to me, just tremendously exciting. What's interesting, I would just say very quickly is we're still asking the question. Are these still software companies or something different? So you could say, this is just software going after agriculture. Now you still have a software business, or you could say this is still an agriculture business, or you could say it's something totally different. That's a question I'm personally very interested in. Patrick: If we think back to the people behind all these innovations, are there any things that you've learned about, I guess the first meeting, the first two meetings, the first three meetings for screening out people specifically and their potential to deliver against building one of these transformative technologies? Martin: Hardest thing about being a founder is just managing your own psychology. And a lot of that is you have to have this balance between diluting yourself enough to not run away streaming, but not diluting yourself so much that you'll run off a cliff. And this sounds like a very high level answer, but having lived this so significantly in my own startup and now living it with others, my biggest early sensitivities is, is the person tackling this optimistic enough to push you the hard times, but self-aware enough to know and realistic enough to know to make very practical decisions. I actually think that's the biggest balance for all of us. Patrick: How do you test that? How do you try to get a sense for that without having worked with them yet? Martin: Oh, there's two types of evaluations that you do on companies. One of them is all of these things come out in the state of the business. So if it's later stage company, you kind of don't have to. If it's a problem, it would've materialized. And I do believe that later stage investing can largely be relatively mechanical, like you should do the work, due diligence, do all the market work, this and that. Early on, I think free form discussion is just incredibly important because anything that's rehearsed is just not an indication of reality. So I personally just like to spend a fair bit of time talking about things. And often I like to talk about things that aren't actually the company itself. So I love to talk about experienced backgrounds, lessons learned. Probably my favorite line of inquiries, lessons learned, especially if we've got a shared background, like they work the company and know the company worked. They've at startup, and they know the startup. So I spend an inordinate amount of time there. And mostly what I'm looking for, I don't really care about right or wrong answers. I really do care about self-awareness. You know, an appreciation of the level of sophistication, the problems that are being solved.",1278
96,"Martin Casado - The Past, Present, and Future of Digital Infrastructure",How to Invest in an Uncertain Future," Patrick: If you put your investor hat on, I guess your purely selfish investor hat, meaning you were just trying to maximize returns, and you could somehow have a crystal ball that would reveal some information about the future, which is currently uncertain, where if you knew what the future was going to hold, be super valuable to you as an investor, trying to earn a return. What would you ask of that crystal ball? Like what would you want to know about the future that you're not sure which way it will go? Martin: I am very curious about where crypto lands, and I think there are three potential views, right? On one end, on the most negative and barren folks are like, ""This is all fake. It's just Ponzi scheme, yada yada, yada."" On the extreme other end, it's a total reformation, not just of technology and companies, but an organization. This is like everything. You don't just have routers. You've got crypto routers. You don't have just storage. You have crypto storage. You don't just have businesses. You've got dos. You don't just have money. You've got DeFi, like everything changes. And then there's a bit of a middle view somewhere. This is a continuum which says, ""You know what? There's something very innovative there on the ability to build networks. There's a number of primitives that are very innovative on the ability to build applications. There's a number of innovations on how you offer new services to consumers where you don't know the endpoints. There's a lot of great primitives, consumption to monetization layer, just like social was primarily a consumption monetization layer.""In that future, that layer is on top of a lot of systems, but you still have traditional computer networking and storage. You still have traditional clouds. You still have to know all of those things. And it's something that's added to that. And I think the answer to that question given the amount of money that's already involved is enormous. And I don't think anybody knows the answer. I tend to be in the middle where I think that there's a real innovation there. I think there's real value. I think it's a real unlock for a lot of new business applications and use cases. But I think that infrastructure itself, a lot of the traditional models still applies. You still have to build databases. You still have to use storage. You still have to understand the trade offs of asset. A lot of these things still apply. Patrick: Obviously distributed systems. Some of the smartest people in the world are working in distributed systems, not necessarily crypto networks, but just like the ability to distribute state or update state constantly faster, smoother, or whatever. As an infrastructure person, when you look at the current technology in crypto networks, maybe the dominant three or four, what are you watching or interested by or looking at, the consensus mechanisms, the scaling ability? What are the dimensions that you as an infrastructure person are keyed in on today? Martin: The crypto origin solves a very important problem. That's traditionally not been solved practically. And that is allowing basically an anonymous set of people with no prior trust relationship to have strong guarantees on something, right? Originally it was a ledger, and then it's become more to generalized compute. That's a very, very real innovation thing. And that unlocks very, very interesting business use cases like we've mentioned. But distributed systems is one of those things that you just can't paper over with a thin software layer. You can't hide it under an API. You've never been able to. There's entire languages that just help programmers manage distributed systems. What's important is what developers end up using, or what distributed paradigms they end up using, because that will drive the capabilities of the system. So if everybody says, ""This is a purely distributed world and everything I write must be purely distributed,"" that will have some implications of the type of systems that you can build.So the thing that I'm most interested in as kind of an old distributed systems guy is what are the nature of the applications? Is this going to land in the realm of purely distributed stuff? Is it only embarrassingly parallel applications, like DeFi is an embarrassingly parallel application? There's other things that are embarrasingly parallel. Or, is this going to go more to the model of general compute? Is that something people are going to do? Are people going to build like the AWS in crypto? The answer to that is actually very, very significant, right? You could say, ""Well, listen, traditional distributor systems are great for building AWS, and this is going to just be the consumption monetization layer, or it actually is going to cause innovation in the way that we do distributed programming in the future."" I don't think that's clear yet where that's going to land. Patrick: When I first had Chris on, maybe it was a year and a half ago now to talk about that left end of the spectrum. It's so compelling. There's so many aspects of it that sound like it will unlock so much. And it just seems like the pace has been frustratingly slow in terms of just actual outcomes. Do you think that's a fair characterization? Martin: There's the promise of crypto that's what it means to the users of crypto. And then there's the mechanism you use to get there. Those are two totally different things. And I think a lot of the promise is actually being realized. The amount of innovation, the amount of developers, the amount of platforms, I think that has been tremendously rapid and very exciting. But I think sometimes we conflate the innovation of crypto, what it means to the users and innovation with the actual mechanisms to get there. There's this grand conflation. And if you can get that with traditional mechanisms in combination with these newer innovations of distributed systems, I think it's still a win.And that, to me, is the big question, like where does that land? So I believe that you're still going to have traditional switches and routers to make the internet. And then I believe that you're going to still have traditional storage layers and things like that for some large subset of the workload. And then there's going to be certain portions that are embarrassingly parallel. Now, Chris and Ali were on our crypto fund. They would say, ""You know, Martin, like you can distribute all of those things and we're going to, and it's democratized. It's going to disrupt the traditional infrastructure."" That very well may be the case. And again, sitting on the board of all these traditional infrastructure companies, I'll tell you, they're selling to all the crypto companies would suggest there's a lot of adoption of traditional infrastructure. Patrick: As we wrap up, step back and think just very big picture within the world of digital infrastructure kinds of companies, trends, et cetera. Where do you think your most bullish relative to maybe your peers and most bearish relative to your peers? Martin: Here's where I'm the most bullish? I think we're just getting started. I literally think that like infrastructure is basically the beginning and the end of technology. Honestly, I believe that the future like vertical SaaS ends up becoming horizontal thin layers on top of core infrastructure components. And if infrastructure unlocks the capability of these apps to do new things, I just feel like we're in early innings of this. I think we've got decades of massive, massive growth. And I think a lot of the value is that most of the value will accrue to the infrastructure. So I just think on the entire space, being hyper bullish. As far as being bearish, I tend to be the most skeptical that infrastructure businesses look like software businesses. AI businesses tend to look more like services businesses. I think infrastructure business tend to have lower margins. So I tend to be quite skeptical, not skeptical, but I tend to be a little bit more conservative on the actual profile of these. Patrick: Martin, this has been so much fun. I've learned a lot in our conversations just about how things are being built in the modern digital world, and all the guts matter a great deal. And I think I've done a nice job exploring those today. I ask everyone that I interview the same traditional closing question. What is the kindest thing that anyone's ever done for you? Martin: Oh man, my entire life has just been people taking big bets on me. You know, every major move has been someone taking a big bet on me. Every major positive inflection in my life. And this is from PhD to being invested in, to being hired. Whatever is someone taking a huge, huge bet on me and boy, I'll never forget that. I really think that major inflection points have been through the kindness of others, not through like any sort of skill of my own. Patrick: Fantastic. So many people say something like that, be a reminder to pay it forward. Martin, this has been so much fun. Thank you so much for your time.

98,Aswath Damodaran - Making Sense of the Market,Inflation as a Dominant Force," Patrick: I've wanted to do this with you for, I don't know, I guess more than a decade since I started reading your work on valuation and markets and narrative and numbers, so many different things. I think because we have the opportunity to talk about so many different topics today, it's important that we start with the most important one in today's markets in late May 2022, which is inflation. Inflation's something that almost no modern investors below a certain age have ever had to deal with as professionals, and all of a sudden, it's been thrust in their face. I'd love you to just do a deep dive for us on how you as an investor, ultimately focused I think on valuing companies, think about inflation as a now dominant force in markets. Aswath: I think it's interesting when you said most investors below a certain age haven't dealt with it. That's true for investors in the US, perhaps in Europe. The reality is there are countries outside which have had inflation, sometimes astronomically high inflation. Turkey, for instance. I mean, they've had to deal with inflation now for a decade. I think that sometimes talking to people outside your geographies can give you some sense of what you need to be scared about. I think that's one thing that I found early in this discussion. When we first started talking about inflation in 2021, I found it disconcerting that people are so quick to dismiss inflation. Not only did they buy into the feds and the administration sales pitch that this was transitory, it was going to go away, it also was a big deal. I think only people who've never lived through an inflationary period will ever say, ""What's the big deal about inflation?"" Because it takes over the conversation as it is right now. It drives everything else out of discussion and it drives the market. I'm afraid we're in one of those spirals where inflation drives everything we do in markets. Patrick: Maybe you can describe just exactly how that mechanically works. Why is inflation so incredibly important, good, bad, and ugly? Aswath: To understand inflation, I think we've got to break it down into two components. Now, one is what I call expected inflation. Expected inflation is something that we can build into our financial assets. So, if you're buying a bond, if you expect inflation to be 5%, you set the coupon rate at seven or 8% to cover inflation. Expected inflation to me is the more benign part of inflation. The part of inflation that's deadly is unexpected inflation, which is inflation coming in higher or lower than expected. When inflation is unexpected, you've not had a chance to adjust to it. Now, if you own financial assets, unexpected inflation can cut both ways. When inflation comes in below expectations, as a bondholder, you're happy because you set coupon rates at 7%, and inflation is now at 2 or 3%. That actually spreads across all financial assets. When inflation comes in above expectations, it's devastating, because you never had a chance to build it into prices, you have a mad scramble going on adjusting prices to reflect the new inflation. What does that mean with bonds? You got to mark down the price of the bond because a coupon rate is not high enough. With stocks, the same phenomenon plays out in a more subtle way. With stocks, at least you get a chance to adjust your cash flows, unlike bonds, so the effect can vary across stocks. It's unexpected inflation that is so deadly. I was just finishing up a piece on inflation to follow from what I wrote a couple of weeks ago, where I actually in each decade look at both expected actual inflation and the portion of that that's unexpected.We talk about the seventies as a high inflation period, and it was. The eighties were also a high inflation period if you look at the average inflation rate. But here's the difference. In the seventies, unexpected inflation was always positive, which meant inflation came in consistently above expectations. In the eighties, inflation was high, but towards the second half of the decade, inflation came in lower than expectations. We look at what stocks did in the seventies and the eighties and what bonds did in the seventies and the eighties, you can see how devastating it is for financial assets when inflation becomes high and volatile. My concern with what's been happening in 2021 and 2022 was seeing a pattern that we saw in the seventies, which is people's expectations are set by what they've lived through. The reality is most people entering the market, if you look at the investors in the market in 2021, enter the market in the last 10, 15, 20 years. For those people, the only inflation they've known is low and stable inflation. It takes a while, and this is the behavioral component, for people to adjust their expectations. One reason I think we were so slow to adjust to inflation is because we thought this was a passing phase. It's going to go away. We fell back on, ""Inflation's always been low,"" because that's the only thing we knew. So, I think it's the unexpected inflation that I think is so damaging. What we're seeing in markets right now is markets are trying to adjust to what's the true inflation going to be. I mean, we all agree that the 8%, 9% that we're seeing is probably too high a number, that some of it is supply chains, COVID excuses that were given early on.But we all also I think finally agree that we're not going to go back to 1% or one and half percent inflation, which is what we had in the last decade. The question of where we fall between the one and a half and the 8 or 9% is what's driving markets. If inflation subsides back, the most benign scenario, goes back to 2%, which is supposedly the fed's target, that's the most benign scenario. But that scenario is becoming a lower and lower probability scenario the further we get into this process. At this point, the question is, will it go to 3? Will it go to 4? Will it go to 5? And adjusting from a 2% expectation to a 5% expectation is devastating for all financial assets. It's not just stocks. It's not just bonds. In any type of financial asset. That's why I think we need to think through this process a little more carefully and adjust our portfolios accordingly, because we're going to have this go on, I think, for pretty much the rest of the years we try to find what I call steady state, an expected inflation we can live with. Patrick: Obviously, we have some historical precedent for this. You mentioned the seventies and eighties. What are the big lessons that you take away from those periods of history as it pertains specifically to portfolios? Obviously, cash lost a lot of its value in the seventies. What about everything else? What is the lesson that you think might be portable from other periods of high inflation in the west or around the world to today's market? Aswath: If you think of cash as investing in T-bills, which is what cash has become now increasingly, it actually did very well because it kept up with inflation. What was more dangerous, we invested in longer duration financial assets, bonds, stocks, because there unexpected inflation meant you had to readjust the price for whatever the new inflation came in. That said, though, there are some subgroups of stocks that'll do better than other subgroups. In the seventies, for instance, you found low P stocks, small cap stocks did much better than higher P stocks. So, in a sense, if you think about this as a very lazy categorization of value versus growth and the small cap premium, much of the small cap premium that people keep talking about in valuation was earned in the 1970s. It was the decade where the small cap premium was strongest. So, for whatever reason, small cap companies had more flexibility to adjust inflation, and there's a reason why the more established you are as a company, the more your business model has already been set, the more adjustment is involved when inflation hits you, because you got to change the way you do business. I think that the lesson from the seventies and the eighties is there's really no safe spot among financial assets, but among financial assets, there are relatively less damaged versus more damaged assets. Patrick: If you think about something really naive, which would be that equities might be a safe place because they might have pricing power in aggregate and they can sort of pass the inflation onto their customers, why is it necessary then that equities as a financial asset are in bad shape in a high inflationary environment? What is happening inside of companies that make that the case? Aswath: That's where the contrast between expected and unexpected inflation comes in. You're right, companies can adjust to expected inflation. I tell people, ""Look, if you tell me inflation's going to be 10, you can guarantee meat's going to be 10% forever."" We'll all learn to live. We'll all write our compensation contracts with a 10% clause in there. We'll adjust for prices. The problem is when inflation becomes higher, it also becomes volatile, which means that when inflation is 10%, it's far more likely to be swinging from 4 to 16 than inflation is 2%. What kills companies is the uncertainty about inflation. Here's why. Let's hear a company with long term investments. You got to make a decision on a 30 year project. I mean, go through the basics of capital budgeting in a company. You sit down, you make projections about how much you can raise prices in the future and what your cash flows will be, and you're building it based on expectations. But now that expected inflation could be 4 or 16, you're going to be far less likely to take that long term investment. Here's the first area of disparity. Companies that have to make longer term investments will be far more hurt by high inflation than companies who can live with short term inflexible investments. Inflation kills infrastructure companies. It kills companies which make long term investments, because those investments now will either be delayed or not taken when inflation becomes uncertain.If you look at outside the US at countries which have had hyperinflation, not just talking about 5, 7, I'm talking about 50, 100 or 5000% inflation, every company in that country becomes a financial service company, because they discover it's easier to run a bank on the side and lend money out short term than it is to build factories or toll roads. So, you need pricing around the sense of not just setting prices, but being able to adjust prices quickly. Very few companies have that degree of pricing power, because that requires that your product be incredibly non-discretionary, that people buy it no matter what the price you charge, that the competition behaves the way you do, because you can't unilaterally just adjust prices if you're in a environment. Third, that the regulatory framework you work with actually is quick. I'll give you the example, utilities should be relatively protected against inflation. The reason is that there are regulatory commissions that should allow you to set prices that incorporate inflation because you're supposed to earn a return equity roughly equal to your cost of equity. The problem is regulatory commissions are composed of people appointed by politicians. So, inflation is 12%, you know the right thing to do is pass on that 12%. ""Well, why don't we set it at 4 or 6%? People can't afford the 12%."" So, during high inflationary periods, even though in theory, your prices should keep up with inflation as a regulated company, in practice, they don't.It's one reason, I mean, real estate was one of the few bright spots in the 1970s, and people say, ""Should I go into real estate now?"" Especially if it's rental real estate, because you should be able to raise rent when inflation is unexpectedly high. Well, that's true. If you don't live in a rent controlled or you don't own property in a rent controlled city, I can almost guarantee you that even if inflation is 12%, rents in New York city are not going to go up 12%, because I've seen that rental committee get into meetings and decide on what to do. They've had a tough time putting in a 2% increase when inflation is 2%. If you think they're going to increase rents by 12%, inflation is 12%, I don't think so. So, I think the problem is while in theory we can talk about how companies can be insulated against inflation, in practice, they cannot. There's one more thing. Our tax laws are all built around book value, what you actually invest in. So, things like depreciation actually become less valuable when inflation goes up, because you get the same dollar depreciation that you used to with 2% inflation when inflation is 12%, and all of those benefits become less valuable.",2775
99,Aswath Damodaran - Making Sense of the Market,Social and Policy Implications of Inflation," Patrick: What have you learned about goods versus services and that mix in all of this as it pertains to inflation? Aswath: I think it's not so much goods versus services, it's discretionary versus non-discretionary. I think that if your good or service that you provide is something that people can live without, they can delay buying, they can defer buying, you're far more exposed to inflation than if you're not. A grocery store chain will do far better than your special retailer. As you've noticed in the last week, we've seen Walmart and Target, the big retailers all come out and tell the world how badly they're being hit by unexpected inflation. I don't think you're going to see Krogers do the same thing, because you can't delay buying groceries. People are going to pay the higher price. They'll complain about it, but what choice do you have? So, I think that it's discretionary versus non-discretionary. But the big challenge for us, the money we spend now is on things we didn't have 40 or 50 years ago. We don't know how discretionary or non-discretionary your Netflix subscription is. We're going to find out very quickly, right? So, this is going to be the real test. So much of our market cap comes from companies that provide products and services that weren't around 30 or 40 years ago. We're going to find out how inflation plays out on those decisions. Are you far less likely to upgrade your iPhone if the prices are going up 15 or 20% a year than if they're going up 5% a year? We're going to find those things out if inflation is here to stay. Patrick: What about broader economic implications? The idea of income inequality, which is already a big issue, comes to mind. Obviously, this kind of inflation can especially hit the lower end of the income spectrum. How do you think about its impact beyond just companies, just on the overall economy and on people? Aswath: That I think is the human side of inflation. I mean, inflation is described as the tax on the least well off among us, the least powerful among us, because they're the ones who don't have the capacity to hedge it. I mean, it's not as if they have portfolios that they can move around. They're dependent on their income stream keeping up its inflation. If you had concerns about income inequality coming into this process, it's going to get exacerbated by whatever inflation does, at least at the lowest end of the weight spectrum. There's another hidden cost, which is we know that to break the back of inflation, there's only one path, and it's a painful one, which is you got to put your economy into a deep and long recession. I call this the Volcker scenario. Most of the time, people don't have the stomach to sit through that, which is one reason why a lot of countries start in the fight for inflation, but very quickly give up, because an election is coming up and you don't want this to get in the way. But I think the reality is if inflation turns out to be higher than expected and we don't like the results of high inflation, the only way you get out of it is through a recession that's deep and painful, and guess who's hurt by that? Exactly the same people. So, in a sense, you're between a rock and a hard place here. There is no easy pathway out, which is one reason early last year I argued that even if you believe that inflation was transitory, the thing to do was to act as if it was not and act quickly. I've described inflation as the genie in a bottle. As long as it's in the bottle, you can look at it, you can laugh about it, but you let it out of the bottle, getting it back in is really difficult to do. Patrick: Do you think that the policy environment, and again, I'm focused very much on the United States because it's what I know, but I'm interested, I guess, around the world, it seems as though the language out of the fed is that they take this extremely seriously now, after not taking it seriously at the beginning, and that they don't want to be known as the fed that let inflation get out of hand, given that unemployment's at effectively all time lows, things like this, is your sense of the policy response constructive, good, bad? Aswath: I fully understand that Jerome Powell doesn't want to be viewed as the next Arthur Banks. Arthur Banks, of course, was the central banker in the mid seventies who ended up being tarred as responsible, even though there's a whole series of actions that led up to it. So, I think the fed is serious about inflation now, but I don't know whether it has the stomach to carry through what that seriousness requires. The fed has only limited power, and that's the other thing to recognize. The only power the fed has is to make things so painful that the economy, in a sense, shuts down. That's the power it has. It's not got the power to change inflation rates or change interest rates, even. I think that the scenario that is terrifying is if in fact the fed does push the economy to recession but inflation doesn't come down quickly, because then you're caught with this combination of a bad economy and high inflation, which is the late seventies playing out again. That's the danger of having let inflation run ahead for such a long period that getting it back under control might take not just three months or six months, but maybe a couple of years. I started in markets in 1980, and I remember what the world looked in 1980. It wasn't a place where you could easily find a job or you could find places to invest. The benefit of hindsight, we pushed it back so that we don't think about it. It's not something that I want to live through again, but I don't think I might have a choice in this matter.",1311
100,Aswath Damodaran - Making Sense of the Market,Regime Change in Equity Markets," Patrick: If you go look at the long term chart of price to earnings ratios, however you want to calculate them, cyclically adjusted or not, look at that early 1980s and you're going to see a very gnarly looking tale when markets traded at single digit PEs, which is a far cry from what we've experienced. Two more categorical questions on inflation. One is what the behavior of companies can and should be, and then also I want to close on portfolio too. What do you think the smartest, shrewdest companies are doing in the face of this regime change, we'll call it, assuming it continues. Is there going to be a premium on adaptability? You mentioned infrastructure as one example, like longer investment companies have a harder time here, but if you could generalize, what do you think the smartest companies are doing already in the face of this? Aswath: Whenever I think about any issue related to valuation, I go back to my value drivers in the sense think about what can companies do if inflation is the bogeyman that they're worried about? The first thing they'd like to do is make the products less discretion, saying, ""How the heck am I going to do that?"" I mean, think of Microsoft. I mean 10, 15 years ago, the way it made revenues was by you upgrading your Windows whatever to your Windows whatever next. In the last decade, increasing your Microsoft has shifted away from a software upgrade business to a subscription business. Subscription businesses by their very nature tend to be less discretionary. For whatever reason, people are far less likely to cancel a subscription than they are just not upgrade. So, I think about companies pushing towards platform businesses and subscription businesses. I think this gives a very good reason why you might see more of a push happening on that front. The second dimension, of course, is your cost structure. If you have companies with large costs, which are rigid, are more effected by inflation, so you're looking for ways to make your cost structure more flexible. When you're negotiating with your unions if you're a unionized company, you might actually accept higher wages in return for flexibility on those wages, which is rather than set a 7% guaranteed or a 5% guaranteed increase every year for the next five years, we're going to tite it to inflation, so the more you can tie your cost to inflation and your revenues, the less you're affected by inflation. It's easier for some businesses to do this than others. But I think that you're going to see this disparity play out in companies.In my portfolio, this is the first time I have 5 of the 6 Vanguard stock, everything but Netflix. One of the reasons for that is when I look at those companies, I see the capacity to that their products and services, they've actually done a very good job of making the products and services less discretionary, hey have cost structures that are incredibly flexible, their investments tend to be short term and reversible. In terms of risk, they're low debt and very little failure risk, things that you worry about with inflation, because if you're a heavily indebted company and there's big failure risk, swings and inflation can very quickly put you under. So, when I look for my list of, ""Hey, these are the things I want in a company,"" I find them more in technology companies than I do in old time, brand name, consumer product companies. It's kind of a shift away from what you might have seen in the early eighties as to where do I go for companies that are best protected against inflation. I think the places you go now are very different than 40 years ago. Patrick: How do you think about something like return on invested capital, with emphasis on invested capital as a key thing you care about in companies now? Aswath: I know it's become this magic bullet that people focus on. Every year, I actually compute the return invested capital for every company on the face of the earth, 46,000 companies. So, I'm intimately aware of what accountants can do to screw up that number. I mean, I'll give you a classic example. Forget about using the return capital. Computing the return on invested capital for a company that grows through acquisitions is a nightmare. Why? Because acquisitions create debris. Goodwill, what do you do about that? What do you do if you pay with stock instead of cash? I can make a really bad company have a high return on capital if you give me enough accounting discretion to play that game. So, I compute the return on invested capital. It's a metric. It's a useful metric, at least at some broader level of law of large numbers level, but it's not a metric I want to tie my investment strategy around, because I can see things that can go wrong. I think it's one of many metrics you should look at. The problem with return invested capital is as a metric, it's designed for mature or declining companies. You can be a great growth company. Its return invested capital can be either meaningless. The return investment capital if you take Apple is negative. Why? Because the cash actually exceeds a book value of equity and debt. If you take that to mean, hey, the ROI is that Apple takes terrible projects, you're completely mistreating the number. It's the denominator that's negative, not the numerator.For young companies, the ROIC becomes almost meaningless. It's not the kind of metric you want to focus on. So, if you have an investment strategy built around ROIC, and I know there are people, value investors who buy into this, remember, this is going to leave you with a portfolio of older and declining firms, and some of them will be value traps, because what you're capturing with the return investment capital is your past, that this company used to have great investments. Kraft Heinz, has a great return investment capital. It's not because of the new projects it's taking. It's because that 57 varieties of Ketchup are paying off in terms of what they did for you 10 years ago, 20 years ago, 30 years ago. ROIC is a backward looking accounting number to keep that in perspective when your investment strategy is driven entirely by ROIC. I mean, I remember in the 1990s, this outfit called Stern Stewart, this measure called EVA. Half of the S&P 500 bought into it. It's a measure built almost entirely on return on invested capital. The consequences were incredibly predictable, which is companies gamed it, which is they figured out what showed up in invested capital. In those days, if you lease something rather than bought it, it didn't show up as part of in invested capital, so they would switch. I know companies play games with ROIC. So, I'm not saying don't measure it, don't use it. I'm saying make it part of a portfolio of things you look at and be aware of where it's going to lead you in terms of investing bias. Patrick: What do you think about, thinking about the company management, CEOs, CFOs specifically, the importance of the capital allocation toolkit? I'm thinking about debt, raising debt, paying down debt, buying back shares, dividends, these sorts of things, which really haven't so much defined the last decade as tech has dominated and it's been product. I feel like it's been product that really has dominated, not so much this kind of capital allocation, the cash flow from financing type of capital allocation. What do you think about the importance of that skillset for leaders? Aswath: It tells me that you're growing old as a company. You're a young company and your projects make 35%, who cares what your cost of capital is? In a sense, you're not playing games. The very fact that you see companies playing games with that number tells me that your best days are behind you. Coca-Cola, Kraft Heinz, of course they're going to do it. So, investment banks will come in and they'll do the dance, and the reality is the cost to cap from a mature company, no matter how many games you play, it's tough to move. It moves by 20 basis points, 30 basis points, but an inflation could be 3% or 9%. This is like moving the chairs around on the Titanic while you're heading for the iceberg. When you see a focus on capital structure, you're already conceding that your best days are behind you. Nothing wrong with that. It's good to act your age and say, look, our returns used to be 30, they've come down to 18, they're dropping every day. I want to move my cost to capital 10% to 9%. I understand that's where you're focused, but you are not going to be the 10 bagger in my portfolio. You're going to be the company that creates that middle of my portfolio, you might do better than expected, but no, I've got to build my portfolio with a mix of companies. And if every company in my portfolio is playing capital structure games, I've overdone it with mature and declining companies. Patrick: You mentioned going to portfolio some of those stocks that you now have more than you have in the past. What do you think about the other lessons from history and how portfolio positioning should work? You mentioned T-Bills already, that did okay if you just held those through the seventies. I'm even curious about things like gold that I'm sure will become popular topics again. Gold did incredibly well in the 1970s. Yeah. Tell me a bit about what you're doing as a person very interested with your own portfolio. Aswath: Real assets generally hold up to inflation better than financial assets. I mean, that's why real estate did really well in the seventies. The only problem is we screwed up real estate as a physical asset by securitizing it. What's happened as we've securitized real estate is it started to behave more like stocks and bonds. If you look at the last 20 years, look at a year in which your stocks went up as an individual, those in the years, your house probably also increased in price. These stocks go down, your house also drops. We've screwed up at least the segment of real estate as an inflation hedge, but I think more traditional real estate where you buy a rental property and you collect the rental income can still hold its value. I don't own any rental properties, but I am actively looking because I would like to move some of my portfolio into physical assets where I have some control over my cash flows, rather than be dependent on companies paying it. But I think in a more general sense, I know I've always been leery about those people who argue for concentrated portfolios. And I've put some old time value bets to say, it's an admission of failure if you have more than five or six or seven stocks in your portfolio. That if you have conviction, and I hate that word conviction, because conviction goes with arrogance. If you have conviction, you should be able to find companies and put all your money in five companies. Maybe that was true 50 years ago. You're asking for trouble in this market environment to load up your bets on five companies. I would say spread your bets, spread your bets across asset classes, spread your bets across different types of companies.Spread your bets across geographies. European stocks might not have done as well as US stocks in the last decade, but they might be the place to be if inflation is coming back more in the US than in Europe. I think that there's a lesson that you learn from the 1970s or any period of market confusion. It's to be diversified, to be spread your bets. Doesn't mean you've got to own an index fund. If that's what makes you sleep at night, go out and buy an index fund, buy a bunch of index funds. But I think even if you're an active investor, owning only five stocks in this market is almost an invitation for disaster. I would say spread your bets. And I'm glad you brought up gold because again, there are ways you can invest in gold. I'm not a gold, but I'm not going to put 50% of my portfolio in gold because that's a loser long term. I've never owned gold in my portfolio. It might be something I can... Because I've never had a portfolio at the beginning of an inflationary period, but let's give gold credit for what it's used. It's a collectible that's held its value for thousands of years. And I think when I see gold wannabes, which is where I put cryptos and NFTs, they've got a lot of proving to do before they can be millennial gold, which is how I've described them as some people hold them saying, this is where people are going to go if inflation is coming back. Gold has a 3,000 year lead on them, and it'll be interesting to see how these wannabe golds make it through this. This will be the ultimate test.",2798
101,Aswath Damodaran - Making Sense of the Market,The Importance of Narratives," Patrick: When it comes to equity specifically, the idea that you are more concentrated in those big technology companies is a great excuse to ask you about Amazon specifically, because I think you've valued Amazon every single year since it IPO'd. You have an incredibly interesting long experience with the company. I'm just interested in everything you've learned doing that exercise. That's such a cool exercise to think about just in general, but also as it pertains to today's world. Just talk me through what you've learned doing that every single year between late nineties and now. Aswath: I valued Amazon for the first time in 97, I valued every year since. Now when I first valued Amazon, it was an online book retailer, telling a story. I still have that letter that Jeff Bezos sent his shareholders, I think 97, 98. If you get a chance, read the letter. It's amazing in terms of the story it tells. In fact, the way I described Amazon when I first started valuing it, I called it my field of dreams company. The movie, Kevin Costner built a baseball field in the middle of Iowa. The farmer shows up and says, why are you building the field here? And he says, if we build it, they will come. That was the Amazon team in 97. If we build it, they will come. If we build revenues, the profits will eventually come. And they've kept that story as their base story and acted consistently with that story for 25 years. And I described Amazon as a company with the patience built into its DNA. Now I'll give you an example. Amazon Prime was introduced, I think 2003, maybe 2004. For the first seven years of its existence, it did nothing. It had a million subscribers in 2010 seven years later. It was a money loser for Amazon. The shipping subsidies were just killing Amazon every year. In fact, the shipping subsidies alone dropped their margins by about three to 4% every year, but they stuck with it. I can't think of another company that would let an experiment run that long and not kill it when it's not working. Because today, Amazon Prime, I mean, I described Amazon now as a disruption machine. It's not an online retailer, it's not a logistics company, it's a company that basically targets any business which has softness in it and goes after the status quo, which means everybody's fair game. And they have an army every time they want to disrupt a business, that army is called Amazon Prime. They've built the loyalty in that army over 20 years by making sure that when you order things, they get delivered the next day. And if you don't like it, I mean, I live in San Diego, I can go drop it off in a drop off box two blocks away from me. No questions asked, I get an immediate credit.They're building up loyalty here. And that loyalty is going to come into place if tomorrow Amazon says we're starting Amazon bank, would you be willing to switch from JP Morgan Chase? I would do it in a second, but they were willing to wait. If you look at how Amazon has evolved over time, it shows you how critical stories are to driving value. And how critical is that companies stay consistent about their stories over time and acting based on those stories. I can't think of too many other companies that tell the same story year after year and act consistently with that story. What I hear from CSO, big story today, but a different big story next year depending on what's working or not working. You have no credibility if your story keeps shifting and you don't act consistently with that story. To me, Amazon is an illustration of how much stories drive value, and how critical it is for investors to understand the story that animates a company and not just think about it as a collection of ratios and numbers, which unfortunately is what some aspects of all time value investing lead you to do. You take the 12 screens from Ben Graham, you run them through, you got a bunch of screens. Think of that as the Ben Graham branch of UNO. And I've disagreed with Warren Buffet in many aspects of what he does, but one thing that I agree with is he talks about how when you buy a company, you need to understand not just the numbers, but the business, the management, the story that... He doesn't use that word, but that's basically what he's investing in is a story that he understands and he believes is actually meriting a higher price than the price that the market is attaching to it. I would encourage people, even if they're number crunches, to start thinking about the stories behind companies and whether those stories actually make sense long term. Patrick: When you're, let's say coming upon a new company and trying to figure out its narrative, how it uses stories, what do you do? What is the way to do that with fresh eyes? Aswath: I listen to their stories. I mean, let's face it. Silicon Valley is now training founders to tell stories. The problem is those stories are fairy tales, which is they tell big stories. And I'll tell you the vehicle that drives these big stories, it's this number called total addressable market. You might have seen this in the prospectors of every young company that's gone public. Uber went and went public, said that total addressable market was $5.2 trillion, trillion dollars. You know how they came up with that number? They estimated how much people spent buying cars or buying subway tickets. They added up everything spent on transportation. And there is no way that Uber's actual market is 5.2 trillion. But what they did was they put that number up front and they hope that it'll dazzle investors so much that they would never ask any of the follow up questions. They said, market is big, therefore Uber must be worth a trillion dollars. It's what I call the Cathie Wood approach to investing. Tell a big macro story and say, therefore, every company has to be worth a lot because it's that big story. I call it the big market delusion, but they get away with it because people listen to their story. They look at the total addressable market and they don't try to construct a story of their own. When I look at a young company, I listen to the management, I listen to people who like the company, I also listen to people who dislike the company and then based on everything I've learned, I try to construct my own story. Every big name tech company that's gone public in the last 12 years, I valued at the time that they filed their prospectors. I don't wait til a banker puts a number because that kind of biases your evaluation.I try to value based on what I see in the numbers and what I see as the story for the company. In hindsight, I've been horribly wrong on some of these. I don't apologize for it because my investment decisions have to be based on my story, not a VC story, not the management story, not Goldman Sachs' story for that company, but my story. And I've tried to stay true to that notion of Hey, I value company based on my story. I'm going to be wrong 100% of the time, but I'm willing to reconsider. I valued Uber every year since 2013. For the first six years, I didn't think it was a company that I would invest in, but towards the end of 2019, I told my story, I came up with the value and for the first time, I found Uber to be trading at a price lower than the value. I bought Uber, even though its story might not have shifted for me that much, but the price had shifted enough. I hate Netflix as a company story. I like to think of my stories in terms of pictures and for me, the picture I get when I look at Netflix is a hamster wheel, which is this is a company that goes to market, tells them that they have a lot more subscribers. That's been the selling point. The way they get a lot more subscribers is by throwing stuff at the wall and hoping. They spend billions on content, they've ruined the entertainment business for everybody else. They get more users, make more content, get more users, go back to the market, get a higher market cap. And I said, the problem with this wheel is how the heck do you get off that wheel? And we're discovering the pain of getting off that wheel right now with Netflix is because the user numbers start to slack off. How do you stop producing or spending as much as you did on content?Because you've hardwired all of us Netflix subscribers to turn on the TV and expect 15 new shows every day. With HBO, I expect one new show every month, maybe, but Netflix, at least 15 shows a day, otherwise something's wrong. And that's how Netflix has trained me, how the heck do you untrain me without losing my subscription? I think that Netflix has a bad storyline or at least a number, but for the first time, the price is getting to a point where even with that bad storyline, I might be interested in investing. I'm going to say something that traditional value investors might view as sacrilege. At the right price, I will buy any company. No matter how damaged it is, how terrible the... At the wrong price, you could be the greatest company in the face of the earth. And I'm not jumping on the ship with you because the price is not right. We spend a lot of time assessing company quality and management quality, we need to think about as much what the price we're paying for that is. We're looking for mismatches, a company that is of great quality that the rest of the world thinks is crappy. That's what a great investment is. Patrick: I love the visual of the hamster. What other visuals come to mind? Maybe among the FANGAM stocks or something? I just love this concept. Aswath: Amazon, of course, a field of dreams work really well. I would rewatch the movie every time I thought about Amazon, I'd rewatch the movie. And now of course, whenever I see Thanos in an Avenges movie, I think of Amazon. Patrick: That's a great one. Aswath: Because if you are a competitor, that's all you need is one click of the finger and there goes your business model, right? The day Amazon entered the grocery business by buying Whole Foods, the collective market cap of companies in the grocery business dropped by $60 billion. Every time Amazon enters a business, we have no idea whether Amazon will ever figure out a way to make money on that business. Everybody else in that business becomes less valuable. To me, Thanos and Amazon. It depends on how you think about Thanos is the bad guy or the good guy. I mean, the power that Amazon brings to the game, I think I've never seen a company more feared than Amazon in my experience in markets because companies in every sphere kind of fear. When I think of Google, I just think of the search box. See, I never called Google ads because I've never bought into this fiction that it isn't seven businesses or eight business or whatever it claims to be.If it's an eight business, it's like Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. If you look at the collective revenues, it's amazing how much of Google's revenues still comes from that search box. You might talk Android, you can talk about all the other stuff, but 93, 94% of its revenues comes from advertising driven by that search box. Whenever I pull up Google on my browser and that search box comes up, I said, there's the engine that drives it. In fact, the interesting question with Google is it's got all these smart people on that campus. It's created all these great products, Nest, it's got Google Home, it's got all the Google documents that we end up using. Why has it been so difficult for Google to take the skills it brought into the online advertising business and convert to success in other businesses? Part of a broader question is why do established companies in one business have so much trouble extrapolating that success into other businesses? Because I think if we can know the answer to the question, maybe we can save ourselves a lot of money and ask some companies to stop trying. Patrick: What about Facebook and Apple? What images come to mind for you for those two? And Microsoft, I have to ask about all of them. Aswath: For Facebook, I think the notion of a Facebook friend is actually a very good way of thinking about Facebook status. 10 years ago, everybody wanted to be Facebook's friend. Even six years ago. Today if you think about it, it's friendless. I've never seen a company that is this bereft of support from any part. I mean, everybody hates Facebook. That's not a good place to be, but it still has a money machine. This is, I think, the irony of Facebook is that everybody claims to hate them and what they do, but they complain about Facebook on Facebook, which to me is the hip... And that's why I bought Facebook after its Cambridge analytical scandal. As I said, I understand that you guys are very upset about the fact that Facebook has invaded your privacy, but ask yourself a question. How did they get all this data on you? And the answer is, you gave it to them. I mean, there's an old saying in Silicon Valley that if you're getting a product or service for free, you're the product. And that's basically what you need to remember is we've used the technology companies because of the conveniences they've given us. I mean, I remember when I used to have to buy a Garmin GPS to put in my car, I mean, cost a couple hundred dollars, pain in the neck to maintain. Do people even have traditional GPSs in their cars? It's because our phone's a free GPS. But there's a price we pay, which is to use Google Maps, your location has to be turned on all the time. And you might say, what's the big deal? The reality is this is a quid quo pro. We've used the free products or service or what we thought were free, and in return, we gave these companies data about us and they're using the data on us to build a business.Facebook's business model is built on invading privacy. I mean, let's be quite real about this. And we're contributing to that business model. I don't think we're going to walk away, because we're addicted. I think that with Facebook, I think about the notion of how you can be friendless and still be extraordinarily wealthy. Apple's too close to my heart to actually think about anything and I still have my Mac 128K, the very first computer that I ever bought. I've been an Apple user since 1981, but whenever I look at the Mac 128K, I realize very quickly that Apple is not a computer company anymore, it's an iPhone company. All I have to think about at Apple is look at my iPhone. It's an iPhone company. With all its pluses and minuses, the iPhone is perhaps the most lucrative single product in history in terms of cash flows it's generated for Apple. The problem with the iPhone is you're now in mature business. Pretty much everybody has a smartphone. You're very dependent on upgrades and keeping this business going. With Apple, the problem is you've essentially built a $3 trillion, $2.5 trillion company now on a single product. And I think from that perspective, it's probably more danger than a Google or a Facebook, because any failure on the part of that single product is going to have consequences that are monstrously large. I mean, imagine an iPhone 14 that nobody wants to buy. And I don't even want to think about the consequence, but that could be disaster, because that's 75% of your revenues and profits right there.",3446
102,Aswath Damodaran - Making Sense of the Market,The Evolution of Alpha," Patrick: I would love to spend some time talking about the nature of alpha or edge in markets. How do you think about the evolving nature of edge and alpha through time in the great investors you've studied? You said last time we talked that idols is a very dangerous word in the investing world, maybe you can describe why. I'd love to spend some time here and pick this topic apart. How has it evolved? Aswath: I don't much care for Tom Friedman, but I'm going to steal a title of his book. The investment world has become a lot flatter. I give the example, 1981. If you're an equity research analyst who worked in New York, you already started with an advantage. In those days to look up an SEC filing, you actually had to walk in the SEC offices. The SEC didn't have offices in Des Moines, Iowa, but it did in New York City. You had access to information that let's say an investor in the Midwest, an individual investor, would not have had. You had mainframe computers that you were able to use as your tools to feed in and people didn't have mainframe computers sitting around in their backyards. You had execution advantages because the way in which you were able to trade, I mean, so remember these were the days before online trading. If I wanted to trade, I took on a broker. There was a time gap, there was an execution gap, perhaps even a cost disadvantage. 1981, you had a comparative edge over me if you were a professional investing. Didn't mean that you took advantage of it to make money because you were trading it, but you could see why some people were able to exploit that edge. I tell people, look, if you take Ben Grahams 12 screens. To run those screens in the 1950s, you know what you'd have to do, right? You'd have to sit down with the ledger sheet, take every company, enter the numbers by hand, sit there with, I don't know, an abacus- Patrick: Months, yeah. Aswath: There were no calculators, whatever it was and compute each ratio. Then can you imagine sorting that page? It's not an Excel sort. How the heck do you sort a page where you computed these ratios physically? Just doing this on 50 companies, the thought of it gives me a headache, but if you were able to do it, you had a significant advantage over other people who didn't have access to those annual reports, who didn't have the time and the patience or the resources to do it. Today I can go online and there are all these automated Ben Graham 12 screens, I hit them, they're on the 12 screens for me two seconds later, the companies pop up and the question is, if I can pull that up, what makes you think that running these screens is going to give you a differential advantage? I am shocked at how much of traditional value investing is just running screens. Whenever I've had a chance to go to Omaha, I don't go to the meetings themselves, but talk to people who come to those meetings. I asked them a question. These are self-defined value investors. I said, when was the last time you actually valued a company? And don't tell me you buy companies low PE ratios and high dividends or whatever it is, that's not valuing the company, it's running screens. Maybe one in 100 actually values companies. And the response is classic. They said, we don't value companies because we don't like to make assumptions. What? Investing is a set of assumptions. The fact that you have using past data doesn't mean you're not making assumptions, you're just not making the assumptions explicit. And the second argument they give is even more preposterous, which is we don't like betas. Okay. I don't like betas either. You don't like modern portfoliotary, that's fine. That doesn't mean you can't value companies. If you're telling me that just because you don't like modern portfolio theory, you don't think risk matters, then you've reached the wrong conclusion.But I think so much of value investing has become screening. The question I would ask is what you do as a portfolio manager is run screens. What makes you think you're bringing something to the table? I can run screens, I can run the same screens you can, often on the same databases you do. Where is the differential advantage? I think the first reality is finding that niche has become a lot more difficult, which is one reason I think active investing collectively has had more and more trouble with passive investing, ETFs and index funds. And that's not going to change. I don't think active investing is going away, I think it's going to become smaller business. A business where niches have to go beyond we have a 23 story building with big computers and lots of databases, because that's not going to be enough of a niche for you to find your alpha. If your focus becomes all about finding alpha, you've lost the script and here's why. In a sense, you need to find alpha, but not at the expense of creating a backstop on my portfolio. And what I mean by that is our portfolio has become so focused in creating alphas, they go out and take insane bets on companies because they want to deliver that positive alpha. I'd much rather that you go for a tiny or even a zero alpha and keep my portfolio... At least keeping up with the market than seeking out alpha.I think the way we rank managers based nav encourages them to be not just risk takers, but reckless risk takers, because that's how you end up at the top of the alpha list or the best perform... I would never invest in the best performing manager in any year or even over a five year period, because they're going to almost wager that best performing manager has a much greater chance of being the worst performing manager in future periods than the middle of the group. I think that rather than look for the highest alphas, you want to go for consistency, even if it means settling for little or no alpha. The Hippocratic oath of doing no harm should really be first, front and center for anybody's managing other people's money. If it's your own money and you want to make bets, big bets and hope they pay off, fine, but don't play games with other people's money. We take 40% of your portfolio and buy Valiant, which is what some value investing funds did in the five years ago before Valiant blew up and then say, well, we never saw this coming. I know you didn't see this coming, but you didn't have to put 40% of your portfolio into one company. Patrick: As I've grown and studied in this world, I've become probably less interested in investors and more interested in companies. And you mentioned this idea before about being dangerous, maybe to have idols and just study other investors for example, and then maybe take the wrong lessons from those studies. Do you think there is any utility in studying other investors, and if so, what is it? Aswath: I think there's something you can learn from everybody, including bad investors. There's something I learned from Cathie Wood. I've learned about how macro trends do matter. I think she's very good at calling macro trends, but I've also learned from our mistakes that just because you get a macro trend right doesn't mean that the microbes you make in that macro trend are correct. We all agree that 10 years from now, a greater percentage of the cars sold on the face view are going to be electric cars. I think there's consensus on that, but does that mean Rivian is where I want to put my money? Not necessarily. I think you can learn from both good and bad investors, I think you can learn from retail and professional investors, I think you can learn from Uber driver's mistakes on what he did wrong. Because when Uber drivers, I constantly chat with Uber drivers because I've learned more about Uber by talking to Uber drivers than I would ever learn from talking to Uber management. And often our conversation veers off into investing and what they're doing in investing and they talk about what they did, and classic of course is I put my money in Bitcoin and look, it's doubled.I think we can learn from both good and bad investors, as long as we're open to recognizing that there are things that each of these groups does that is good and things that they do is bad, but that the overwhelming factor driving success and failure in markets, we hate to admit this in academia and practice, is luck. It's amazing how as human beings when we succeed, we attribute it to our skills. And when we fail, it's always bad luck. I remember the shock of I CEO complaining about markets and how markets didn't understand the company, because the reason there's a stock prices drop, he's convinced that markets are misunderstanding the company. I said, it's amazing how you discovered markets misunderstandings when your stock price is dropping, but you never talked about this new stock price was going up, quadrupling in a year. I think people often attribute to markets any of their mistakes and then claim for themselves as successes. Recently, Cathie Wood has been complaining of how inefficient markets are. How amazing how in markets move against you, they're inefficient, but they move with you, they're efficient. Very strange definition of efficiency, but it's self-serving.",2036
103,Aswath Damodaran - Making Sense of the Market,Modeling and Valuations," Patrick: If you think about skill versus luck, as you think back on the God knows how many company level valuations that you've done by hand, what are the most common mistakes that you've made looking back on those? Aswath: I think the most common one is that you let recent history drive your forecast more than they should. I mean, this is well established by April finance, which is what's happened in the recent past. I'll be quite honest, the aftermath of COVID, I made COVID part of my stories for a little too long. I finally let go, because I think it was such a big part of our personal lives that we assume that this was here to stay, that everything that you saw happening was now a long term trend. When you look at the Zooms, the Pelotons, the companies that benefit COVID and how quickly they've come back, it's a recognition that when we sit down to value companies, as human beings, we tend to wait in our most recent experience the most. It's one reason why I look at data. I call this my version of playing moneyball, which is I look at data, not because I want to drive everything to data, but to get a sense of perspective. And it's one reason why when inflation came back, I had to go back a hundred years to think about, because if I thought about just the last 10 years, it's very easy to dismiss it. So I think my biggest weakness often is the lack of perspective, and of course there's bias, which is sometimes you've fall in love with a company and your story for the company to the point that you're not willing to listen to others. I call this keeping the feedback loop open. I'm human like everybody else, I get defensive when people critique my story. But I've learned that to make my story better, I've got listen, and I've got to say the three most powerful words in investing, so I was wrong. I mean, my most successful valuation exercises have come about after I've said, I was wrong. Patrick: That's really an Excel spreadsheet and a traditional DCF, one of the things that you tend to find in there is some term at the end, which is some steady state assumed long term growth rate. When we last talked you made an interesting point that maybe that little assumption at the end, which sometimes can drive a large percent of the value is a lurking error. And the reason is that the life cycle of companies, just the nature of businesses, how fast they grow, how fast they mature, how fast they decline has changed or evolved over time. Can you describe that shift in change and how investors should think about it? Aswath: The best way to think about it is think about two examples of companies. One at 20th century classic, let's say GE, they founded in 1893, peak, I don't know when, then you had the second coming with Jack Welch, and then finally, now if you look at GE, it's a walking dead company. I mean, there is no happy ending here, it's just limping its way towards the end. But it's had a good run, a great run, 130 years from start to finish. In contrast, let's think about a company that's not truly a 21st century company. It was founded in the late part of the last century, Yahoo, right? Founded in 1992, got to a hundred billion dollars in 1999. From nothing to a hundred billion in seven years. Glory days lasted about four years until Google came along, went into a decline that very quickly turned into a steep decline. By 2015, the company was done. 23 years from start to end. Another reason I emphasize that is when we use that forever assumption that we see in discounted cash flow evaluation, we're really not assuming forever. We're just saying if it's 70 or 80 or 90 years, using a forever gives you a number close enough that you can get away with it. So with the 20th century, that was perfectly okay.Companies took a long time to build up, stayed a long time at the top, and then took a long time to decline. If you're valuing Airbnb, I'm not sure you want to make that same assumption because it might be a great company, a great platform, but the nature of platforms is here today, gone tomorrow. So I think that when you look at technology companies and the companies that are coming at you in the 21st century, there's nothing in valuation that requires you to use a perpetuity. So it's a convenience assumption. You can assume for instance that after your 10 or your five, that your company will last another 15 years and be done. And mechanically, there's no reason you can't do that. We don't do it because inertia drives us to do the same things we were taught to do on the companies of the 20th. So I think then when people talk about the need for new models and new metrics, they're missing the point. The old models work fine, it's this new thinking that's needed with those old models. And that's tough for us to do as human beings because we tend to do the same things that we did when we first started. And I think that unfortunately locks us into practices that might not work for the companies of today. Patrick: Two of the strategies, I guess, maybe on other sides of the spectrum that have worked really, really well, I'd love to get your take on. One is momentum, literally just buying things that have done well in the recent past. And the second is maybe from the value side of the coin, ignoring macro conditions like inflation, that we started the conversation with, that really all that matters is the company specific work. What do you think of those two ideas in today's new market? Aswath: I mean, let's say momentum. Momentum is a trading strategy. In fact, I like to draw a contrast between investing and trading. Investing is about assessing the value of something, buying at a price lower than the value and hoping and praying the price adjust your value. In fact, much of what you see in investing discussions is about. Trading is much simpler, you can argue a much more honest way, a much cleaner way of approaching markets. Trading is about buying at a low price, selling at a higher price. There's no value, cash flows, growth, who cares. Momentum is a trader's best friend, and we know that at least in the short term, momentum is the strongest force in markets, much bigger than earnings or cash flows or growth or any of the fundamentals. So as a trader, you live on momentum, but you die on momentum, which means that you make money when momentum is in your favor, but if you don't get out early enough, that same momentum that was your friend becomes your enemy. So I think momentum is a force that we underestimate at our own peril as investors. That's why I sell themselves short on overvalued companies. Many of these companies are in the throes of momentum. You try to sell short on these companies. You might be right in the long term, but you're going to be bankrupt before you're right, and that small consolation. So momentum is a force that we've got to respect. So when people make fun of charters and technical analysts, let's face it, they're bringing the right tools to the trade if they're trading, because those are tools that are designed to detect shifts in momentum. You might not believe in support lines and resistance lines and all the need candle stick shots, but let's face it, they're trying to detect shifts in momentum and get out ahead, and I applauded it to them. They're at least being honest about what they do. The problem is there are many people who claim to be investors, but they're really playing the momentum game.It's amazing how their top 10 stocks happen to be the 10 stocks that have gone up the most over the last two years. It's amazing that your value approach gave you those same 10 stocks. Traders masquerading as investors. On the second front though of just buying good companies and ignoring the bankrupt, that worked really well in the 20th century with U.S stocks, and the reason is the U.S was the most mean reverting economy of all time in the 20th century. Everything almost was on clockwork, recessions lasted a certain period, the way you came out of recessions, you could almost graph out exactly how you came out of recessions. Mean conversion as a strategy worked really well. Which means that if macro variables got out of sync, they came back to sync. And when that's the case, you can in the very long term ignore macro variables, and if you pick the right companies, everything's going to work out. The only problem is let's say you bought Russian companies two years ago based on them being good companies, guess what? There's no rescue package waiting for you because the Russian economy is definitely not an mean reverting. So the question I would ask for investors who adopt that strategy is, do you believe that the 21st century is going to be the same as the 20th century for the economy in which you're investing? Is it going to be a mean reverting economy? And if you can tell me with having thought through this that that's an assumption you're ready to make, then I think it's perfectly okay. Going out and picking the very best companies and letting the macro variables fall where they might.And I'll give you a classic example, a lot of people invest in oil companies based on normalized oil prices, which is kind of a, no, I'm not going to be worried about what the oil prices say, there's a normal oil price. I'm not sure that I could tell you what a normal oil price is anymore because we're facing climate change and pressure on fossil fuel companies. Assuming that cycles will return back to what there were in the 20th century or even the first part of the 21st century seems to be asking for trouble. So I make a general statement, mean diversion works, it's a very strong force until it doesn't. When there's a structural break in the economy you're in, mean reversion can be one of the most deadly forces in investing. The mean you revert to might not be the mean you thought you were going to revert to. And unfortunately it's been the weakest link and people use Sheila Pease and Capes to kind of... many of those people have been out of markets now for a decade because stocks have looked expensive to them. Because they've said, I don't care what interest rates look like now, I won't buy stocks if they don't trade it below 15 times earnings. I don't care what kind of adjustment we get in this market, the amount of money you've lost by staying out of the market for the last 10 years, because you believed in mean reversion is money you're never going to get back. So I think people have to be careful in assuming mean reversion and at least think through explicitly whether they believe that things will revert back to the way they used to be over the world has changed, and the answer world has changed. You got to be careful about not making that mistake and just jumping in based on things reverting back.",2422
104,Aswath Damodaran - Making Sense of the Market,What Happens Next to Risk Assets and ESG," Patrick: It brings up two things. First I should have asked about interest rates and discount rates and what the difference is in your mind between those two things. We'll do that first, and then I also want to talk about ESG, which is one of the things I've been most excited to talk to you about. But I should have asked this earlier, how do you think about interest rates and discount rates alongside inflation. Aswath: Discount rate is a generic word, a rate that I used to discount cash flow. So for instance, you gave me a T bond, the discount rate is a risk free interest rate. If you gave me a corporate bond, the discount rate is a default risk adjusted interest rate. If you gave me equities, the discount rate is a riskless interest rate plus an equity risk premium. So discount rates and interest rates are not alternatives, interest rates are a part of discount rates. Interest rates ultimately are not set by the fed, and this is I think the delusion that's driven a lot of bad investing choice over the last 14 years, is the fed can keep rates at whatever it wants to. No matter what happens. I mean, think about what's happened at the T bond rate just in the course of the last four and a half months. Started the year at one and a half percent, now it's flirting with 3%. And you can't say this is because the fed is raising rates. In this case, I think the fed is chasing market interest rates. So interest rates are driven, if you think about macro variables by expected inflation in the future, and this is why inflation comes back into the conversation. As the market tries to find a steady state and inflation, the T bond rate is going reflect what that steady state looks like. If we settle on 5% as inflation going forward, there is no way the T bond rate stays at two and a half or 3%, it's going to 5%. Why? Because why would you ever buy a bond with a coupon rate that's lower than your inflation? That's like making yourself poorer intentionally upfront. Now this is not an after the fact surprise. So to me, whenever I think of interest rates, I go back to basics.What is inflation? What is real growth? Because that's ultimately what's going to drive interest rates. And if interest rates rise, all discount rates go up. It's like a tide rising somewhere, and the tide rises, all boats go up. So the risky or a safe company, everything gets pushed up as interest rates go up. So I think that we've had a decade again, of really low interest rates and really low discount rates. The start of 2021, the cost of capital for a median company in U.S dollar terms in the U.S was about 6%. The implied expected return on stocks in the start of zero is 5.75%, think about it. You're buying stocks expecting to make 5.75% returns annually. If I'd offered that to somebody in the 1980s, they'd laugh me out of the office saying, ""What? Do you want me to buy stocks?"" But the reality is when T bond rates are one point half percent, 5.75% doesn't look bad. So I think that we've been spoiled again by a decade of low discount rates, low cost per capital, and that's why inflation is going to be such a painful adjustment process. We all have to reset expectations and that means everybody's discount rates are going up, whether we like it or not. Patrick: How do you think about equity risk premium in a market like this? Aswath: It's a price of risk in equity markets. In fact, I think of it as the one number that reflects all our collective fears and hopes. So when we're feeling good, guess what happens? Equity risk premiums go down. When we're feeling void, everything's going well, equity risk premium goes down. When you get terrified, what happens? The equity risk premium goes up, which is one reason why I find it difficult to believe that the equity risk premium is some constant number that you can go back to. The way in which many people look at equity risk means they look at the past. What have U.S stocks earned over T bonds going back a hundred years? But that misses the point that this is a shifting dynamic number. Russia, invades, Ukraine, guess what? Your equity risk premium needs to go up. We're facing a recession, you might lose your job, your equity risk premium goes up. That's why the start of every month I compute the implied equity risk premium for the U.S market. I'm not claiming this is the right premium, but I'm saying given what's happening, this is what the market is pricing risk at in the equity market. Take it or leave it. At the start of this year, that number was 4.24%. At the start of May, it was 5.2%. I wouldn't be surprised if at the start of June, this number is closer to 6%. That's a huge increase in risk premiums over a short period in market like the U.S, but it reflects that collectively, we were all much more terrified of the economic future than we were at the start of the year, and it's going to show up in the equity risk premium. Patrick: How do you think all of this affects what has been a historic period of time for early stage equity investments? Given I think all the trends you've talked about, it's been a lot of cash gone out onto the riskiest part of the return spectrum, if you will. And I think generally, a lot of investment in new companies trying new things is probably going to lead to good outcomes for people in the world generally. What do you think happens in that part of the world and the ecosystem there? Aswath: The best way to think about that ecosystem is to think about collectively what I call risk capital. Risk capital is the capital invest, the riskier spots of economy. Venture capital is even public market investors investing in the riskiest companies. And one of the unanticipated side effects of having really low interest rates is that risk capital became a much bigger part of markets. Why? Because you really don't lose much by not putting your money into something safe when you're making 1% or one and a half percent. So far bigger chunk of capital in the market became risk capital. That's what saved us in that COVID crash is risk capital stayed in the market, it pulled the market back very quickly. The question is, can risk capital survive inflation? And I think inflation is a much tougher test than COVID because what inflation does as I said, brings in the uncertainty about the future that makes it much more difficult to start new businesses. So I think we're going to be in a period where you're going to see risk capital become much scarcer, which is bad news if you're a young company even with great prospects, because you need capital to keep going. Because you're a cash burning machine, you need capital to keep going, and if that capital's not there, then I don't care how great your potential is, you're going to have to sell out to the best bidder.It's what happened in 2001. It's what's happened every time, risk capital. It's been a long time since we've had a significant draw down of risk capital, 2009 first half maybe, but I think we're going to see a significant draw down in risk capital, and that's going to affect the pricing of not just young private companies. You saw SoftBank took a big write off recently for all of its investments in young private companies, but also those small growth companies in public markets that are dependent on continued capital access to keep going. So when you're seeing the Pelotons and the Zooms getting marked down, it's because of the worry that, Hey, these companies need to raise fresh capital. They're approaching a market that's much less receptive to that pitch than it was two years ago, five years ago, 10 years ago. Patrick: It allows us to go to the topic of ESG, and one of the big maybe born of climate change, one of the big trends that's affecting the behavior of companies. You mentioned oil companies earlier, and ESG went from sort of something that early in my career was always kind of around like a net or something. You'd hear that term over and over again, but it didn't really seem to impact anything. All of a sudden, almost overnight, it's seeming to pervade assets, decisions, BlackRock being sort of the poster child here. Curious what your mental image of BlackRock is. Talk to us about ESG, I think you've got a very contrary view here. Aswath: It used to be contrary, but I think increasingly it is becoming more the consensus because when I first wrote about ESG in 2019, I wrote about it because I was really curious, like you were about. What is it that's taken this concept off and what made it take off was the establishment bought in. Usually when you have something new come in, the establishment is, and this case, what I mean by the establishment buying in is that was the year that the conference bought the bunch of 171 CEOs who signed off on this stakeholder declaration, where they said the end game for a company should be to keep all stakeholders happy. Larry Frank of course jumped in and saying, ""The ESG should be what they prize as one of the big strategic imperatives."" And I said, no, what's going on here? So I started looking at the sales pitches that I was listening to on ESG, and here's what I found. These services that claim to measure ESG, didn't agree with each other. Second, you had all these consultants going around to companies claiming that ESG would make them more valuable companies, and I looked for evidence and I couldn't find any. Had all these ESG funds claiming to beat the market, and I took a deeper look and it looked like their entire outperformance came from the fact there's a lot of tech companies in their portfolio, not because they had good companies. And I also heard talk about how ESG is making the world a better play, and I looked at the percentage of energy we're getting from fossil fuels, and guess what? It's not changed much over the last decade. So I said, ""Where's the beef here? You're making all these claims, there seems to be no basis for it."" So my first post was actually an invite.The ESG advocates should tell me what I was missing. And over the next year I heard from ESG advocates, and what I heard from them made me even more doubtful about whether ESG had any foundation to it. First, I think an ESG expert is an oxymoron. How can you be an expert on a discipline that has is nothing to it? Are you some kind of Deli Lama and mother Theresa rolled into one that you can see virtue and recognize when you see it. And in the two years, since of course, I've become more and more convinced that the reason it's taken off is become a money machine for the people involved. Services, S&P, sustained analytics basically are making money measuring ESG. Investment funds, you slap ESG on the tight level of a fund, you can add 15 basis points. That's what BlackRock did for its carbon transitions fund. Almost exactly identical to its regular index fund. But by taking three stocks out, they're able to charge 15 basis points more. You have consultants, experts, running around charging companies for ESG advice. I'd love to be a fly on the wall, listen in on exactly what it is that I can do to become more virtuous. And you've got academics, and I don't think academia issue who are publishing papers on ESG that shouldn't see the light of day. I mean the quality of research in ESG is abysmal. In fact, this is the only area in finance where I've seen people use meta studies. They take 500 studies and average them up, which is absurd. It's not the way to do research, the law and large numbers doesn't work. When you got 500 bias studies and you put them all and you come up with an average. When I made all these points, the response was, ""But what's the big deal when making the world a better place?""And they pointed to engine one and how successful it was at Exxon Mobil. Engine one was that activist fund that essentially had BlackRock and others throw the weight behind them, and they got Exxon Mobil to divest themselves of some of their fossil fuel reserves, amazing victory. The key word is to divest themselves, who do they sell it to? They sold it to a private equity group. In the last decade, private equity funds have invested 1.2 trillion in fossil fuel reserves. You're not stopping the development of fossil fuels, just pushing them behind the curtain. And the people exploiting these reserves now are far less scrupulous than the companies. Putting selective pressure on publicly traded companies in the U.S and Europe to behave virtuously is not making those things go away. You think Aramco's management is sitting around and saying, ""Well, what is the ESG thing to do?"" They're pumping out oil, and this is I think the Kabuki dance that ESG leads you to. It's a feel good scam that is making a lot of people wealthy. The new story past yesterday, when S&P, ESG, whatever index they've created, which is a money machine for them because they create an index, then funds get used to the index, then ExxonMobil on it. Patrick: They're not Tesla. Aswath: They're not Tesla. And of course I read Margaret Graham, I think was her name. She's the person in S who heads their ESC group. I don't know the person, I'm sure she's well intentioned. And I read a blog post on why Tesla didn't make the cut. And as I read it, the four things that have always troubled me about ESG all came to the surface. First is it's an incredibly opaque topic. I mean, at the end of the blog post, it was not clear what Tesla had done, they all claim it's based on numerical scores, but what determines what factors go up that score and what weightings you touch? Completely opaque. The second is she actually gave away the fact that it's a gaming model and what gave it away is in a blog. She said, it wasn't that Teslas score dropped, it was that everybody else's score went up. Now I'm a teacher and if I find the scores of a group of people all selectively go up, it's because they're playing the game I ask them to play, which means that there's a checkbox system and Exxon Mobil has learned to play it, and Tesla's not playing it. So guess what? Exxon Mobil climbs the ranks, Tesla does. This has been the greenwashing gaming part of it. I've always described it as a feature of ESG, not a bug, and it's kind of in there. The third is it illustrates that ESG is political, it's always been political. To argue that it's some objective measure is, I think, delusional. When I hear ESG advocates complain about the political backlash that's coming against ESG. Like some of the red states now have movements to stop their endowment funds. They complain about how it's become political, my response is that's like APY Romania complaining about all the fires that are around. I mean, you brought the politics to the game, what made you think that the politics would always work out in your favor?No, the question is not why it's happening, but why it took so long to happen. So I think the mask is off ESG. To those people who say, ""But I want to invest in good companies,"" please do, but use your definition of good because your definition of good and my definition of good are going to be very different. If your definition of good is built around data privacy, don't invest in Facebook. If my big issue is climate change, then I won't invest in Exxon Mobil, I'm going to invest in Tesla. So I think that by definition, goodness is not going to be global. The E part is where they've had the most success in coming up with the number, carbon footprint, and of course, they've gone crazy with all of the different disclosures. The S part should be a non-starter, and here's why. Name me one social issue where you can define a global consensus. There's not a single one. This is where the politics comes in because the minute you start saying the S includes this, for instance, one of the things that was mentioned in the new stories was that the reason Tesla didn't make the list was because of the way they treated employees. And here's what I'd love to see, I'd like to see a comparison of a GM employee and a Tesla employee in terms of wages and benefits. And I'd also like to see a survey of how many Tesla employees would like to go to work for GM and vice versa.So if you are making this judgment, it must be because of some aspect of what Tesla does that led you to believe maybe that doesn't have a union for you, that's a game breaker. And that's fine if that is what makes or breaks a game for you, but you can't then define this as your measure of goodness and enforce it on everybody. This, I think, if nothing else should make people think again, what exactly is an ESG score and what does it measure? Because even the measurement services have no idea and to build an entire discipline on something that cannot be measured is I think just malpractice. I can't wait for this concept to die, but I'm afraid there's too much money to be made for this concept to go away quickly. And it's going to be a long and painful death, and guess what? They're going to come up with some other buzzword to replace it. Because the history of businesses, what was ESG was called SRI and CSR. And I mean, I've seen the acronym slide through the only acronym I want to attach the ESG now is RIP, but I think, but they're going to come up with something else, replace it. I'm sure.",3953
105,Aswath Damodaran - Making Sense of the Market,Discussing Disruption," Patrick: Bringing up Tesla is an opportunity to ask you about the nature of disruption. Two things are curious to me, Tesla versus all other car companies. You mentioned Amazon earlier as sort of universal disruptor, but one company that it doesn't seem to have disrupted is Costco. And you might think if you had said in 1999, Amazon is going to be Fano snapping its fingers. Costco is probably one of the first companies you might have thought of OGs they're in trouble and yet they've thrived. So I'm really curious how you think about disruption as a force and also about companies that seem protected from it. Aswath: That's a great case study to examine. I mean collectively, brick and mortar retail in the U.S has been devastated by Amazon collectively. So Bed Bath & Beyond, the department stores. So you got to ask why do the companies that managed to evade this storm, what did they do? In a sense we can tell what they shouldn't do. The department stores tried to out Amazon, Amazon. They thought that what Amazon had was an online site. So if we start an online site, then we'll be like Amazon. And then they started cutting costs in their stores. They had less sales people. I remember going into a Macy's, I haven't been in a department store in a decade. And part of the reason is my last experience at stores like Macy's, you walk in, you pick up something you want to buy and you can't find a cash register that's open. This is not a great business model if you're a retailer. We are not letting people pay for things they want to buy, but they cut cost to the bone. So the brick and mortar stores that try to out Amazon, Amazon, are trying to cut costs and make their experiences worse as brick and mortar stores fair. Costco built a model that is a different one. I think that subscription model is an act of genius because first, it self-selects the people who walk into a Costco. It might not be a lot of money, but that set whatever it is, 79 or $80 or whatever it is now, $60, is that entry fee makes it more of a selected group that wants the kinds of things that Costco offers. And Costco is not a traditional retailer. You walk into a Costco, you walk out with not one month's supply of something, but 10 year supply of something, it's found a way in brick and mortar retailing saying, you will not be able to find this on an Amazon.Every time I walk into Costco, there at least one or two items that I feel I never went into buy those, but I said, that looks like something I could use. I don't know what percentage of Costco sales come from impulse buy, but I guess that even people who shop regularly at Costco, walk out with one or two items that they didn't think they wanted or needed before they walked in. And the experience to me in Costco is unique. It's an experience that you know what the system looks like. It's, you're not going to get a lot of sales, people help, but those tasting stations, you're not going to get tasting stations on Amazon. I don't think they've figured out a way virtually for you figure out what something tastes like. But I think it's designed an experience that makes shopping, if not fun, different. I think that's what people in businesses that are disrupted by Amazon have to think about is, what can we do to make people still come to us? Because they tried out Amazon. Amazon, it's not going to work. I think the other example of a company that managed to fight off Amazon successfully was Alibaba. 2003 or '04, it was any person's game. eBay, Amazon, Alibaba, anybody could have won, but Alibaba crafted an online retail presence that was uniquely suited to China, starting with a website Taobao, which is the Alibaba main shopping site.If you ever click on it, wear sunglasses, because you're going to be dazzled by multiple things hitting you. It's basically the way to describe it, it's like walking into a bazaar, which is exactly how Asian shoppers shop, is they're used to bazaars. They're used to chaos and multiple people coming at them. That's not what Amazon thought their customers needed. In the US, you hit people with a bazaar, they're going to click out and move away. That's too confusing for them. But Alibaba succeeded by creating a China centric version of online retailing that essentially allowed them to win that game. So it's not that fighting and beating Amazon is impossible. You got to do it on your own terms. And that's not easy for many companies. Patrick: When you value an individual company, will you often assign some sort of disruption risk premium to it? And if so, how do you do that? Aswath: If you believe the disruption is expected, the best way to do it is to build it into your cash flows and growth and margins. You got to build it into your story. If it's your worry that there will be disruption, then you got to bring it in as some kind of external risk. I think of decision trees and statistics. When you do a discounted cash flow evaluation, you're valuing a company as a going concern with the assumptions you've made and then you say, ""Oh my God, this could happen. There's a small chance. There's a 10% chance of this happening."" Then you actually have to value a company with that. So rather than try to put it all into one valuation and try to get the discount rate to carry a weight that it was never meant to carry. If you truly are worried about a scenario that could happen, that could very well change a value, treat it as a different valuation. When I valued Aramco, I valued it as 330 million barrels of oil under the sand where you stick your finger in the sand and oil comes out, a huge cash machine. I came up with a value of 1.8 trillion, I think for the company based on oil prices then.But the thing that worries me about Aramco is not that they would stop pumping the oil or that oil will cease to be used. I think they will continue to be the one company standing, even if there's climate change and people continue to use less oil. It's the worry that there might be a regime change, because when you buy Aramco, you're buying a piece of Saudi Arabia, because 80% of Saudi Arabia's GDP comes from oil. And by extension, you're buying a piece of the Saudi Royal family, because they're all connected at the hip. And the question you got to ask is, what if something happens? What if something like what you saw in Egypt 13 years ago? You woke up one morning and Hosni Mubarak who is viewed as dictator for life is no longer running the country, what if that happens in Saudi Arabia? What will that mean? Rather than try to bring it into my Aramco valuation, I said, I value the company twice. I valued with the status quo. The House of Saud stays on long term, running the country and I benefit from the cash flows from oil. And I said, what if somebody else?I didn't put an ISIS scenario, but a scenario where somebody who's less receptive to foreign investors. It's very easy to add a royalty tax. What I thought was an incredibly profitable company can become much less profitable overnight. I valued the company twice and took an expected value, based on the probabilities I assigned. Those were subjective and I've never felt the need to run away from that word. Subjective is the word that I would use for pretty much everything you do in valuation. There are no objective numbers in valuation. Last year's number is objective, but you don't invest based on last year's numbers. You base it on the expectation that last year's numbers will be next year's numbers. That's subjective. So for those people who critique valuation as being subjective in making forecasts for the future, I'd much rather face up to uncertainty than hide from it. Patrick: Speaking of subjective, what characteristics do you think will define the most successful leaders? I'm thinking specifically CEOs and investors over the next decade. Aswath: Use the word adaptability. That's one word that I think is going to be critical, because I think one-size-fits-all is not going to work in this market. You got to have people who are willing to change, who are willing to listen and who build companies that can outlast them, who build management teams. It's the one thing I admire that Jeff Bezos did at Amazon, is he built a management team at Amazon. Same thing with Bill Gates at Microsoft. It's the one thing that terrifies me, even though I admire some of the things that Musk has done at Tesla. The one thing that terrifies me at Tesla is how the entire company is built around a single personality. I can't name a single top executive at Tesla. Can you? Do you know who the CFO of Tesla is? I could probably go look it up.The fact that we never hear from the guy is interesting. I don't even know, it could be a male or a female. That's how little I know about the CFO. I know about the top management team. I don't even know who the PR person is. Because every time there's an issue at Tesla, guess who the respondent is? It's Elon Musk on a Twitter feed. You want companies where adaptability is very much part of the business, where you have CEOs who are willing to trust the people they hired to make big decisions without constantly looking over their shoulders. Companies run by imperial CEOs and people who think they're Cesar, I think are companies I would stay away from. Patrick: Yes give me the perfect excuse to close on a really fun topic. What do you make of everything going on with Twitter and Elon Musk right now? Aswath: With Elon, you never know. It could be a big, long game in which he's willing to throw away a billion dollars. I think that for him, it's not about buying a business. I believe him when he says it's about buying a platform for free expression. I don't think he understands fully what that means, because I don't think you can actually have a social media platform which is completely free and open to everybody, because there'll be chaos and lawsuits. But I do think that he feels, for him, I think about his investing in Twitter as the same reason Steve Ballmer bought the San Diego Clippers. He wanted a plaything. And for Musk, this is more, I think, a reflection of his belief in people should be able to say what they want without having somebody censoring them. I believe that that's his main motivation.Now I don't think he's going to keep Twitter as a private business forever. I think he intends to change it and then take it back to the market. And what you're looking at is financing, is essentially his personal financing funding a deal, which normally I would say is not a good idea. You don't want to borrow against personal assets to fund a $45 billion bet on privacy, but it's his money. I think he's serious about it. But I think also that by the end of this process, there are going to be lots of bridges we've got to get and cross before the end game plays out. Patrick: Are there any major topics on which you have a divergent view that we haven't talked about today? Aswath: I think disclosure is the issue where I think I'm most in disagreement. A lot of people think that more disclosure is the answer to our problems. I hear this from value investors, growth investors, just let companies disclose more, from ESG people, more disclosure. And my experience, disclosure is this double-edged sword. Do you think that more disclosure leads to more information and more sensible decisions? But if there's anything we've learned from behavioral research of giving people information, is sometimes less is more. I think we're actually doing a disservice to investors by having what I call disclosure diarrhea. Have you read the risk section in any prospectus? Patrick: It's ridiculous. Aswath: 50 pages of garbage. And this is the problem, companies have learned to play the game. They've discovered that if you disclose everything, it's like disclosing nothing, you lose perspective. They don't know the big thing versus the small things. You throw them all into the same pile. It's like going to confession. And in a sense, disclosure is a very good analogy to confession. You confess for an hour to a priest and along the way you confess to small sins like I coveted my neighbor's car with, oh, I murdered my neighbor along the way. And because you spent an hour, the priest doesn't remember what you said by the end, he says three Hail Marys and you're done with your sins. I think unfortunately, disclosure has become the same way. For many companies, disclosure is not about telling you that they won't do things in the future. It's about confessing their past sins, and in such detail that you don't even remember what they confessed to and they can go back to sinning again. I think the SEC has missed the entire script on this one by focusing on one-size-fits-all. And take the latest climate change things that are coming out of the SEC. I'll predict that 10 years from now, you're going to have 300 pages on carbon footprint at every company and that nobody's going to read those pages.Last time I was at an ESG conference, I asked people how many of them had flown to the conference. I was actually doing it on Zoom, but they were actually at a physical conference. About three-quarters of the people had flown to the conference. I assume that you flew to conference, you picked an airline. How many of you picked airlines based on carbon footprint? If you noticed when you take an airline, it tells you what your carbon footprint is going to be. There's a room full of ESG advocates, not a single person picked an airline based on carbon footprint. And I said, ""So what are we accomplishing by disclosing this? Are we actually not diluting the value of carbon footprint by having everybody disclose it?"" California, we have this system of propositions, which allows people to get things before, in fact, the Athenians when they argued against direct democracy should have used California as an example of why direct democracy is dangerous, is you can put anything on. In the mid '80s, they passed this proposition that, well intentioned, that any product with the ingredients that could create cancer had to label that the product could create cancer. But it was written so badly that it covers pretty much everything.That proposition, if I go down the street from where I live, I go into the taco store, there's a sign that says our tacos could cause you cancer. If I go into CVS, coming in through those doors could cause you cancer. And after a while, you just stop reading it, because to close this actually my neighbor has an 18 year old son. He was standing outside the other day, smoking a cigarette. So I said, ""You're smoking a cigarette, we've known for 40 years it causes cancer."" He says, ""Everything causes cancer."" And this is exactly where we're going to end up is, if you label everything as cancer causing, then how do you separate tobacco from tacos? I think that's a problem with disclosures. If everything is disclosed, then I have no idea what matters and what doesn't. And that's unfortunately where we're headed. And that train's left the station again, because the accounting firms have jumped on, the disclosure firms have jumped on, the activists on every single issue have jumped on. And we're going to end up with disclosures that nobody reads. Patrick: Aswath, I've so enjoyed this conversation, but I'm more thankful just for a decade plus of writing that you've done that's taught me a lot. I'll definitely point people specifically to Narrative and Numbers being a book among your many books that really had an impact on me. I've so enjoyed our time together. I ask everyone the same traditional closing question. What is the kindest thing that anyone's ever done for you? Aswath: Probably how I was treated when I first came to the US. I came from a part of India where I'd never watched TV. I'd seen TVs when I traveled, but I grew up in a part of India that was probably 200 years behind the times, in terms of where the rest of the world was. I landed in LA my first day and talk about a culture shock, where you go from never watching TV to watching roller derby as your first show on TV, followed by, I don't know, some talk show where people are screaming at each other. I was completely lost. I am still thankful for the kindness that the people around me showed for my complete ignorance about how things worked. When people asked me about why I prize being a US citizen, I still talk about, that's a kindness I wouldn't have anticipated in much of the world, but I did get it here. And it made me who I am. It allowed me to stay and flourish. For that, I'm always grateful. Patrick: You've reminded me of one more question I want to ask, which is about teaching. You've taught for a long time. And you've said to me before that what your goal is when you're teaching is really not the facts of the class. It's a change in mindset for some subset of the students. Can you just describe that idea? Because I think everyone out there, like you said, you can learn from anyone, you can teach to anybody. So the notion of teaching is powerful. Say a little bit more about that goal that you have. Aswath: Everything I teach is going to be dated. Even as I said, things change, what works today will not work tomorrow. So if all that people learn is how to do things the way I do them, five years from now, three years from now, even six months from now, they're going to find themselves lost. I view my job as letting people see how I come to the conclusions that I do, why I do what I do. Now, I call this having a window on process, so people can see why I value companies the way I do. So it's not what I value Tesla at, but why I ended up with that value. In the process, what I hope they will get is a way of thinking through questions. I think my biggest worry as a teacher is how Google Search has ruined thinking. Because when you have a question now, what are we trying to do? Go to Google Search, look up the answer. Let's take as an example, what tax rate should I use in evaluation? Rather than think through how you would answer that question, you say that takes a lot of time.Let me go to Google Search. Somebody must have answered the question already. And also there's somebody out there that says, ""This is what you should use."" But what you lose is that capacity. Your mind is a muscle like everything else. If you don't use it to reason your way through to answers, then you will find it very difficult to ever start reasoning. I view teaching as giving people a window to my reasoning, so they can see my reasoning. They can agree or disagree with my reasoning, but at least they can see how I think and hopefully that'll rub off on them, so they develop their own way of thinking. It doesn't have to be my way of thinking, but their own way of thinking through issues. Patrick: It's a wonderful place to close. Again, I'm thankful for your time. I've learned a lot today and always do. Thank you. Aswath: Thank you.This site uses cookies to improve your browsing experience. By using this site, you are consenting to this policy.",4393
106,Brian Schimpf - Anduril: Building The Future of Defense,Introduction," Patrick: Today we're breaking down Anduril. Anduril builds high tech defense systems for the US Department of Defense and its allies. Crucially, it does so with a speed that emanates from Silicon Valley. Founded in 2017 by Palmer Lucky who previously built and sold Oculus to Facebook, Anduril has achieved the rare feat of challenging the established order in the defense industry. To breakdown Anduril, I'm joined by the company CEO and co-founder Brian Schimpf. We discussed the history of the defense industry, how Anduril's business is counter positioned against the legacy cost plus model, and what Brian has learned about selling to DOD. Please enjoy this breakdown of Anduril.",156
107,Brian Schimpf - Anduril: Building The Future of Defense,The History of Anduril and Defense," Patrick: So Brian, ever since we met over dinner, I don't know what it was, two months ago now, I've been really looking forward to this conversation. I've got a weird fascination with military history. My best friend growing up was a special forces officer. I've just always been around this world without being personally in it. I'm really excited to try to suck as much information out of you today as I possibly can. And given that Anduril is kind of like Tesla, the first new car company that made it in a hundred years or something, something similar could be said of Anduril in the world of defense. I thought an interesting place to begin would be to have you give us a bit of a history lesson of that industry as you saw it maybe when you and your co-founders started Anduril. People have heard names like Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman, but give us from your perspective what the history looked like from the seat of trying to start a new company in this very intimidating space. Brian: Might actually rewind a little bit back to 1950s era, talk about a lot of the projects there that were incredibly successful. So defense was this scion of being able to move fast, do really innovative things, where all the new technology came from. You look at a lot of the past successes, even relatively trivial things like Pentagon, largest office building in the world, built in 13 months. Build anything in 13 months these days. You look at ICBMs and the intercontinental ballistic missiles. A lot of the first rockets, those were done within the DOD in a very short time period, just a couple of years going from not existing at all through to having these incredibly capable systems going very, very quickly. We built something like 50 different airplanes and configurations and things like that over just a couple decades period. Skunk Works was legendary in everyone's mind around building the most advanced technology, pushing the limits and they did this all with pencil and paper. So there was this period where this was just an incredibly innovative industry where the best and brightest went to work. It was really generating a lot of novel ideas, the new R&D, it was just moving so quickly, such an impressive pace, building such impressive technology. Throughout the Cold War, that was really the case. Things started to slow down late 70s, early 80s, where duty went to a model of much more cost controls, very predictable schedules, trying to drive a little more discipline into the organization, which was hard to argue with, but the result has been just a lot more bureaucracy, a lot more focus on process over what is the most innovative. And then you fast forward through to the 90s and there was this dinner where they called it the last supper in DOD, where there was, I think at the time something like 50 defense companies that were considered significant players in this space.I think it was the Secretary of Defense at the time said, ""We are going to go through a period of consolidation. Budgets will not be growing. You guys will have to consolidate. I'll leave it to you to figure it out."" And that entered about a decade long period of intense consolidation, where now you end up with about five, six major players capturing the vast majority of the DOD's budget. You have big names like Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon, lesser known ones like General Dynamics, Huntington Ingalls. There's a variety of these companies that have consolidated down nearly every player in the market. And you have this big capture with just relatively few players winning most of the awards. If you're an engineer going into this space today, you may work on one airplane in your career. If the timelines have gotten longer, you look at the F-35. This was started in the early 90s, I want to say, was when they started looking at this. It's going to cost over one and half trillion dollars over its life cycle. The timeline to get fielded is getting insane. They're putting a new nuclear attack submarine in the water with an expected timeline of 2035, with a lifetime running through 2085. I can't imagine doing technology on this time scale. The desire for more predictability, having this very bureaucratic approach I think is incentivized both the government and the defense industry to take this very slow, steady, measured approach and it's really showing at this point. What shifted compared to 10 years ago was there was a belief at the time, early 2010 timeframe that the current players could really solve the problems, it just was a matter of different process or different acquisitions. I think today there's less of a belief when you start looking at modern software problems, looking at AI, how you would actually make the stuff more affordable, how you would have a more software defined approach.There isn't that belief anymore. There's been a real shift that the current players do not have the, it's not even necessarily skill set and talent. It's really the process, the way they think, the way they build is tooled to these very expensive, very large, very time consuming big airplanes, big ships. And that software necessitates a different approach and a different strategy. And that wasn't obvious 10 years ago, but now it is today. And everyone agrees with this, that there has to be something very different, there has to be a new model, and that's what will enable us to win, the speed, the pace, different way of building, different way of iterating, different way of figuring these things out, separate from what we need to do to build a fighter plane or something like that. So it's a very large scale shift that's happened. And this is very recent. This was just not the case 10 years ago. There was still a belief it would all work. But with the rise of more autonomous systems, more intelligent systems and seeing what Silicon Valley has been able to do with modern software approaches, it really has changed the way DOD thinks about how they will build and what types of companies will enable them to be successful on some of these different aspects compared to the past. Patrick: What was that like being a part of those minds changing? We were at dinner with a former JSOC commander when we met and it struck me that it was incredibly important that you had to use military terms, but get a small beach head inside of DOD in order to demonstrate this new style of building deploying, updating, et cetera, that Anduril represents, we'll come to that in a minute. Say a bit about what that early experience was like. I want to come back to why this all happened. It's such a fascinating history, but first, what was it like being around that and a part of that change and what was that beach head? How did you do it? Brian: I think there's a lot of push for taking new innovative approaches and the government gets beat up a lot for not having more innovation and not doing things more innovatively. They're certainly not blameless in the matter. But on the whole, people do want to succeed. They do want to move fast. They do want to field exceptional capabilities. It's just not obvious how. And our view to this has always been, you're going to have to find these early adopters, the people with an urgent mission to solve that need to do something quickly and are willing to take the chance on a new entrant, are willing to take the chance on a new way of building because their problem necessitates it, because they need to do so. And then from there we get success. People start to see models that do work, that starts to become de-risked. And a lot of what we view ourselves responsible for is not just building the technology that can actually solve these problems, but actually helping think through the policy changes that need to exist. How you can acquire this differently, how you can run contracts in a more fair and objective way. How do you use more test and evaluation instead of IS company investment directly? All these things we think are net good for the department, they don't apply to everything, but they apply to a pretty broad range of problems. So for us, it's always been about finding those customers who have that urgency on a problem that requires a different approach. Probably the first real beachhead within the Department of Defense was working on counter drone systems where this is a threat that was very urgent. It was one of the first times the US has had adversaries that can attack them from a distance, where being at bases was not necessarily safe anymore.And we saw it first with the special operations groups that are deployed actively, that the folks who are going to see this threat first and we started out, everyone was looking at it from this problem of, okay, we have these small commercial drones, think GGI drones, that's what the threat is. An IED style threat dropping hand grenades from these things. That certainly was one of the risks for sure, but as we were deployed and as we saw this evolve, you start to see what you're seeing in the news now where there's significant numbers of Iranian backed rebel forces getting higher and higher end drones and really evolving very quickly on their tactics, how they approach this, what sort of munitions they have on it, what sort of protections. And this necessitated a strategy which was taking a very evolutionary approach, where instead of just saying traditional military approach for this would be, we're going to write the requirements, we're going to define exactly what the problem is, we're going to then go send it out to bid. In five years, we'll have a system. We'll put it in production, we'll ship. It'll all work out.We tried this with the IED threat back in the day and it didn't work. What we believe does work for a threat like this is you need to have a constantly evolving strategy. You need to say, I need a, the term they use is a system integration partner, someone who can look at this, understand the threat, understand the state of technology and develop out a roadmap of how do you actually continuously address this, adapt and push out new capabilities according to what we're seeing in the wild? And the key to this is also really doing this in a very software first way. So you're not going to be able to get massive new hardware systems out in the timeline that's necessary, but can you push out new software modules over the air? Can you monitor constantly how it's doing? Absolutely. It's the same model that we've come to take for granted with our phones, even with things like Tesla autopilot. It's just going to keep improving and you're going to learn and adapt as you move through this. That model seems so straightforward in the commercial world, but it's very different than how the DOD has run historically, especially as you start talking about these integrated hardware software systems. Finding that first customer that had that urgent problem actually really wanted to solve it and had the risk tolerance to actually work with someone like us was absolutely critical. We're hugely grateful to be able to work on this problem and the opportunity to make a difference on it.",2356
108,Brian Schimpf - Anduril: Building The Future of Defense,The Product Development Journey," Patrick: Through both your history and this other bookend, your recent experience, it just strikes me this idea of necessity being the mother of invention is just so true in that the Manhattan Project happening as fast as it did, or some of the examples you gave were in arguably more dire conditions than when the US was the clear global military hegemon and a lot of this bureaucracy seemed to have set in. Maybe you can walk us through with that necessity being the mother of invention lens, the idea that the drone itself would be an area of first focus. I want to talk about some of the more interesting stuff, including the autonomous sub that is in the news recently from Anduril, but the drone was the original thing that you focused on. Was that an easy decision? Were there other things that were potentially considered as the first piece of hardware technology? Just walk us through the story of creating this first product from Anduril when you did. Brian: One of the key areas we've focused on throughout is what's the software platform that will enable us to solve a variety of DOD problems? So being kind of a very software heavy company, one of the views is, well, what's worked in, let's say the AWSs of the world and similar, or Amazons or any of these companies or Googles? You have these very general purpose software platforms that you can apply to a variety of problems. These are very hard to build. They're very expensive. But they enable you to solve a wide array of problems in a very connected way and have everything you create with each other. So from day one, we knew that a key part of this was going to be, how do we apply the latest in computer vision and sensor fusion to actually understand what's going on in the world? So this can be detecting drones. This can be detecting things underwater. It really can be any sort of these applications where you're processing sensor data, you're making sense of it. You're trying to automate as many of the simple parts as possible to give humans the right information. And then the other side of this is then how do I actually affect this in the world? This could be deploying one of our interceptors, Anvil out to go and knock a drone out of the sky. This can be steering a sensor to go look and interrogate and get more information to tell me what exactly this is. We can take a variety of forms depending on the problem set you're working on. So throughout this, the software layer we call Lattice was something we knew from the beginning was absolutely necessary and was the only modern way that you're going to be able to build the interconnected future that you really need to have.And again, this sounds so obvious, but let me contrast this to how aircraft are built in the past. Boeing has multiple aircraft programs. That software stack is completely independent for every single one of these. The idea that you would share software across these is quite foreign. It's almost more incidental than it is intentional. This is not the norm. The incentives are not set up to do this. How they contract it, how they price this, it doesn't fit in the normal model, but it's necessary for how you go about these things. So then in terms of applications and problems to work on, there's a variety of things we kicked off in parallel, but I think what has worked for us is recognizing where there's that problem set, where there's the early adopters and leaning in on someone who wants to move quickly. So recognizing that and being able to say, ""Hey, we think we have tech that can solve this problem. There's an opening here. Let's move fast against it"" is something that's very, very important for us. And I think that's easier said than done in a lot of ways, recognizing where you will have that traction and being able to lean into it is not obvious. It takes some experience inside the department knowing where these things can move, who can go against it, where there's a lot of people who work in the science and technology space doing an early research that have that easy entry, this where a lot of the innovation stuff happens. But getting it to fielding is very, very hard. So finding those windows is absolutely key. So for us, fairly early on, we saw this as an emerging threat. We knew this was something that a traditional approaches of just a single sensor that'll solve everything or a single system that'll solve everything will not work. And our style of integrating a solution together with this unique software approach was absolutely key. Then actually manifesting that into a successful working relationship took a fair bit of luck and a lot of hard work to get there. Patrick: Can you talk a little bit about what it's like to develop software and hardware together, understanding that you wanted Lattice, the software platform, to be this fundamental infrastructure layer on top of which you could build apps, which would be the different kinds of drones, the submarine, whatever, really interesting switch up relative to the Boeing example. You've seen other people talk about how the best software comes from people that also make hardware, Apple being the prime example. What's your experience been like there? You ran engineering at Palantir before starting Anduril. So what lessons have you learned about co-developing software and hardware together? Brian: There's two reasons we went after the hardware side as well. Probably the more exciting one is what you're describing, which is being in control of our destiny and being able to shape the hardware to really take advantage of what we can do with software and vice versa is absolutely key. So simple examples of this, being able to design the processing to take advantage of the cutting edge GPUs. So everything we have to do is done on the edge in these very austere conditions and deserts, and very limited connectivity, often running off solar power. It's a very hard problem for AI inference, for example, to really work on. So being able to constantly be able to adopt the latest and greatest embedded GPU while really evolving what the software can take advantage of with that has been key. Thinking about this for drones, you have this ghost drone, we designed that thing to be as simple and modular as possible, where you've got a flying stick and you can bolt things onto it that actually do interesting stuff. But being able to then design and say, hey, here's what I think is achievable in terms of computer vision performance, or what's the very simple API I would actually want to be able to control this drone? What information can I even get from my batteries? That's actually really hard. Being able to pull that information out is very important. When do I need to land? How much power am I consuming? How do I optimize for this? All these factors start to really matter. If we were to go at this from a counterfactual perspective and say, we didn't control the hardware, we'd have to then go get permission or get people to buy in to using our software. And honestly, what's very hard there is, our vision for how the future will come together with larger quantities of smarter systems that are cheaper, that is not the normal business model in DOD.So you'd have to convince someone not only that your software is compelling, but that their business model is probably not going to work and that you need to take a different approach here. It's very, very hard, the timelines are long, and this is not an industry that's incentivized generally to work on IRAD and pursue a vision. If there's not a customer signing up on a contract, it's very hard to get traditional players motivated to work on these problems. The other aspect of this is DOD still really struggles to articulate a software business model that is very effective. So where people have converged on software as a service and will pay what is comparatively a very cheap cost for licensing this product compared to me building it myself, I will then in turn get a working product that actually solves my problem like Slack or Office or any of these things. That model is not very typical in DOD. Where they typically want to, and often for good reasons, custom build the solution, own it themselves and it ends up turning very quickly into a services and labor structure. So it's very hard to have a software business model in DOD. Hardware is very straightforward. They understand why it costs what it costs. It's countable. They understand the value it's providing, before it was there and now it is not. They understand why it would cost money in the future to continue to build this. There's a very straightforward model there that allows you to scale very, very quickly in a way that was very challenging, just selling software in past life. So there's a lot of reasons why we went down this hardware path, partly business, partly to be in control of our destiny, partly to build the tech we think needed to exist. But I think it's proven to be very, very successful in showing what's possible and being able to just manifest something that otherwise would be very misaligned and very hard to create. Patrick: I don't want to lose the opportunity to really contrast this more SaaS-like modern business model of Anduril with the legacy defense model and very specifically the notion of cost plus. And maybe so you could just walk us through how does the defense business complex work from a business model standpoint? Because obviously Anduril is very uniquely counter positioned against that business model and it evolved the way it did for reasons you discussed already, but give us the detailed cost plus model and what you think it leads to, which sounds like it's super long lead times and very expensive unit costs on something like, say, the F-35. Brian: So the cost plus business model, this is the significant portion of the DOD contracts is you run this cost accounting system. So you track every hour, every piece, every PO, everything you're doing and that tracks your cost. And the cost plus fixed fee is then on top of it, you get a fixed profit. So this is somewhere in the range of seven to 12% typically. Look at a defense business, the operating margin will be in that range. Somewhere around 10 to 15%, sitting around there. So when you're developing a product, the government just reimburses you for what it costs. So you spend engineering hours, you spend R&D materials, you get paid back for that. The advantage, well, depends on whose advantage it is. So one, it really shifts the risk of the contract and delivery from the contractor to the government. So the government's absorbing all the risk. This is impossible, it takes too long, they change their requirements, they change what they want, they want it more complicated. It just costs the government more. So the contractor doesn't end up bearing any risk. They're going to get a fixed profit regardless. But you can see the perverse incentive here where there's no risk and has no particular incentive to move faster and actually get these things done on time.So the alternative to this is what they would call firm fixed price. So this is what you'd expect in the commercial world. I read a contract, you're going to deliver me X, and I pay you a fixed fee. If you can do it cheap, great, and if you can't, you lose money. It seems like a very straightforward model. So that transfers all the risk to the contractor to actually be able to deliver. Fortunately, I think a larger number of contracts are being written in this way, where there's pros and cons to this. There was recently a news article where Boeing has bid a number of these firm fixed price contracts, but because of a strategic calculus of underbidding, which works when you do a cost plus contract, then they're losing a lot of money being able to actually deliver these things. And when you're tooled to sort of not require that efficiency, it's corrosive. And it's not malicious, it's not people trying to do bad at their jobs or anything, it's just the nature of the incentives. And incentives do matter on these things. You even see the director of NASA saying these cost plus contracts are a huge anchor on them right now. These are causing a huge problem for them. And you have companies like SpaceX doing things firm fixed price and they deliver on time and it works and everyone's happy. It just seems like so clearly a better model in the long run. And that's how we work.The other idea here is we want to invest in our own research and development. Most defense companies spend a very low percentage of their budget on research and development. The even crazier thing is you get to build that as a cost. The government pays for your internal research and development. Your fee is on top of that, which is wild to me. So most of these companies do relatively little internal research and development. And to me, this is indicative of, you have this belief that the money I am taking in, that profit I'm taking in, is a higher return for the company by just straight giving it to shareholders than me driving growth, new contracts, new ideas that will make my business successful in the future. And I certainly understand why a lot of companies have gotten there when this period of consolidation, unclear if there's a real threat, I certainly understand why these companies have moved to more of a financial engineering and dividends view. But as the threat changes, as the problems change, it's hard for me to believe that not investing in these areas that not trying to lead the way on new technologies is the correct move. So for us very much everything we've done is, we're not going to work on a problem unless we're willing to put our own skin in the game on it. We'll have to have a lot of conviction on the roadmap, what's going to be successful and what we'll be able to scale and what's going to be a real capability. And everything we do we have to have that conviction in because we really do want to put our own skin in the game on it. I think it just aligns our incentives, our goals, and gives us the right motivation to succeed.",3002
109,Brian Schimpf - Anduril: Building The Future of Defense,The Current State of Military Technology," Patrick: You said something there which reminds me of a question I probably should've asked maybe as the first question, which would be for you to give us a state of military technology and military conflict as it pertains to technology today. This is especially important with what's going on in Europe, with Ukraine, with Russia, with our involvement with it. You see bills going to the Congress floor about providing tons of additional aid. I would love your take on the state of conflict and where you think it's going. Because obviously all of this only matters if things continue to evolve and you're there to evolve along with it, which I think is the whole point of Anduril. Precision and technology and warfare is an important topic that we'll talk about a little bit later, but the stakes are high. Give us just your state of conflict and technology's role in it today because I think that's a really important area to explore. Brian: There's two views to these conflicts. Maybe there's like a day one framing, which is, you're launching a campaign. How do you mass a ton of force to be able to overwhelm the adversary, take out key communications and missile systems and defensive systems. How we did Gulf War, where it was a very large scale, day one campaign, and you just roll in with an overwhelming force. And that's where things like stealth bombers, stealth aircraft, long range precision munitions, all of these things become very, very relevant where you're going to have to fight at a distance. And the U.S. By necessity is often projecting power. We're not building up on the California coast. It's always, we're doing something forward. And that is a very, very hard problem to solve. That's the day one view. And a lot of technology is built up around this day one view of how do we have that overwhelming force to make that battle very decisive very quickly. There's a good calculus for that, which is you want to make it so that any sort of large scale conflict could be decided quickly to be very deterrent. You want to make it so that the adversaries in the world think twice about whether this will succeed, whether my aims will be met. So there's a very good argument for having these very exquisite, very high-end technologies.So a lot of the stuff you see around the next generation pieces are really about that. So how do I have that overwhelming force, that overwhelming mass, in early days of a conflict when I have the advantage? Then I think these conflicts tend towards the extended phase of these things where now it's about ground forces. It's very tactical, it's very extended. And I think that's going to be any sort of conflict in the future is going to end up looking like that. So areas of technology that seem to continuously surprise people, surprising that it's surprising, is the efficacy of unmanned drones at all levels. I want to say it was about two, maybe four years ago, I'm bad at dates, but there was a conflict in Armenian Azerbaijan where the Azerbaijanis had Turkish drones. So this Turkish Bayraktar TB-2 drone was one of them. They had Israeli munitions, loitering munitions, precision munitions, things like that. They even had some very low-tech things. They took old Antonov AN-2 biplanes, made them remotely piloted, and used those to then fly in and stimulate the Armenian air defense systems, which were Russian air defense systems. And the Armenians had tanks, they had armor, they had air defense systems. They had all these capabilities there that were a very traditional way of viewing how warfare would play out.And it was a one-sided conflict. The Azerbaijanis were completely decimated, the Armenians, and took very few losses because they were able to fight this in a very remote way. Being able to use these advanced UAVs and munitions and things like that to conduct strikes, to take out adversary positions in a very effective way that was very hard to hide from, it's very hard to defeat. There's a lot of these things, they're cheap, so your missile systems are going to get targeted early. It's a very hard threat to deal with. You look at the Ukrainian fights and in a lot of ways it's similar where, I would not want to be someone in a tank in a modern conflict. It is not a good place to be/ the ability to use these conventional large land forces is very hard. You look at what's effective, it's highly disaggregated. It's having small units be able to have those precision munitions, be it javelins or stingers, utilizing small drones to be able to target strike the adversary very, very fast. And you see a lot of the electronic warfare showing up as well, where there's constant jamming, interfering with GPS, all these things that have been reported, those are all playing out. So you sort of have what I think any of these protracted conflicts looks like, which is this very tactical, very disaggregated fight. And I think that's going to be the hallmark of what a lot of this looks like. Now, if I'm America, if I'm Taiwan, if I'm Ukraine, if I'm Poland, the Baltics, I know I need to have that defensive capability to fight in a very broken down way. My big central infrastructure is going to get attacked on day one.I need to be able to disperse. I need to be able to put up a huge fight and I need to be the biggest bone to choke on possible. And that's something that I think we've believed from the beginning and a lot of the technology we're working on is very dialed towards that type of fight. Where it's very defensive in nature, it's shorter range, but it's the sort of things you need to hold back an invading adversary to really actually defend yourself. And those are the sorts of things that we think are going to be very necessary in the future. It's going to be less super expensive, relatively few systems that you want as the fight progresses on day one, those are still very relevant, but as these actually happen, these are the capabilities you need. And I think demonstrating that, showing that, training to that, will give these countries pause when they think about taking aggressive action because the cost will be so high and the likelihood of success low, where it's very unclear. Will you be able to sustain an offensive? Will you be able to actually meet your aims? And I think Russia miscalculated that, and I don't think there's any reason for them to believe it would be any easier with any other country around them. I certainly wouldn't want to go against Finland. I don't think it would work out very well. That's the type of tack, that's the type of problems that we think we need to solve. You hear a lot of talk of sending like eight MiG-29s to Ukraine. It's like, it won't matter. They will get shot down fast and that will be it. And it's just not the mass and quantity you need, the logistics training, the fueling, the maintenance, it's so hard to sustain these things. You need cheap, tactical, very disaggregated capabilities. And that's really, what's going to enable the fight once you get past this initial volley. Patrick: Do you think that in the future, most conflict will just be machine on machine? Is there some point that we reach where little to no loss of human life, and obviously I'm probably being naive not thinking about the people in power that could create loss of life as a strategy, but is that the arc of military progress do you think? That 50 years hence let's say, a conflict like this would be entirely waged for machine supremacy and then that's clear to demonstrate and that's sort of the end of the conflict? Do you think that's where this is going? Brian: I certainly think that's one outcome, but you get to the question of, what's the ends you're going for? At the end of the day, you look at Russia, you look at any of these things, it's not merely to show that they could destroy Ukraine's military capability, it's to invade and take over Ukraine. And I think invariably, you get to that place where the ends of these conflicts often involve change of political leadership, changing of territory, all these things. In those ends, I think frequently there will be a loss of human life unfortunately. I think you will end up with troops on the ground. You will end up with some sort of actual campaign to effect the change you're looking to effect, and that will invariably require some sort of human engagement at that point. I think you can make the likelihood of success of that very low. Having that as your deterrent effect is often how we think of this. The ends for all of this military tech is not to kill more people or anything like that. It is always about how do you minimize the probability that a conflict happens in the first place?So I think the reality is going to be, yes, there's going to be a lot more machine on machine that's going to happen. It's going to change the nature of how these things are fought. But I think invariably, there will be a human element and there's still going to be the aspect of destruction of buildings, property, infrastructure, refugee crises, all these things are still very bad. There's this view that, okay, once it's fully machine on machine, there's no risk to human life, there'll be more conflict. I'm not sure I agree. I think the human suffering will still be very bad. I don't think there's any world where anyone should believe that these conflicts become less problematic. I think you want to get to a world where one, countries can truly defend themselves, the more powerful invading countries do really understand the consequence, they probably will not achieve their ends. That's what I think will create real deterrence on this. Patrick: It's been amazing to watch the sometimes decades long shift in policy choices or decisions, whether it's in Germany or Finland, or even in the U.S. around this conflict in Ukraine. I think a great way to really drive that point home is maybe to compare the Ghost system with something like predator. The comparison I think could be an interesting way to understand these two differences. People I think will be familiar with the predator drones, especially around our Middle Eastern operations, post 9/11, and viewed that at the time probably rightly so as this cutting edge of technology. So I think it would be interesting to contrast a drone against a drone to understand what the difference in the systems are, how they're operated, et cetera. Could you draw that contrast for us between what Ghost represents and what predator represents? Brian: Yeah, it'll be a little bit apples to oranges simply because predator was meant to be very long range, very long endurance, carry a lot of sensors and munitions and things like that. And Ghost is a small helicopter, fits down into basically a gun case, can be carried, set up very simply and launched think in the order of a dozen miles sort of range, much shorter range capability. It's probably worth highlighting the state of how these larger drones are operated today. So you have Reaper, you have predator, you have Global Hawk. These are all the well known military drones today. It's better to think of them as remotely piloted aircraft. So these things have some sort of radio connection, be it through satellite, through a line of sight link. And they're flown by someone, sitting in a container-sized ground control station where they have a stick and they're flying it like a plane. And there's a sensor operator sitting in there as well, moving around the sensor, looking with the camera, moving these things around. So it's two people. Then there are about a dozen behind that. So then you have people sitting there and exploiting all of this sensor data. So they're taking screenshots, they're building up analysis decks, they're building up products of all of these things and disseminating them out. Then for each of the sensors you'd have on there, you'd have a specialist managing that. So maybe you have some specialized payload that deals with radio frequency information. You'd have someone exploiting that specifically. Repeat, repeat. So you end up having this very large tail to actually operate these things. Plus the ground crew, the large scale infrastructure to deploy these things. For larger drones, to a degree a necessity, but certainly from the operation side is the very manual process. When we've thought about this, particularly you start getting down closer to these small units, this company level, maybe a dozen people size say. You can't afford to have multiple people pulled off to be manning and operating a drone. So what we've really focused on from day one is how do I make these things more autonomous and more intelligent so that you can just absolutely minimize the manpower required?On top of it, you want to minimize the logistics and complexity of how do I deploy these? So when we think about flying ghosts, you tell it what you want to go look at. You just say, here's a building, go look at it. Plot the course, flies it automatically, takes off, just goes, gives you footage of it. You can tweak it and adjust and task it to go do different things. But it's closer to you tasking a pilot than it is a pilot flying a drone with a joystick is then the idea. And then when we deal with the sensor data, it's like how can I make this as simple as possible for you? Maybe you're looking for tanks. Okay. I can go out and autonomously scan an area with a team of drones to go find tanks. That seems like a very straightforward problem that software can solve at this point. And that's how we view this. So we've tried to have this very autonomous, very light footprint view from day one and everything we're building has that view, which is often your limiting factor of how can you deploy these is how many people can I have support it? What's my communications bandwidth? That's often your limit even beyond just simply budget and how expensive is it, which is a big factor as well. But it's often the manning the operations logistics complexity that the US faces, especially since we have to do this power projection, we have to move forward. That becomes the driving constraint. That's a big part of what we thought of. Whenever we design a UAV, we've got some larger UAVs we're working on as well.Nothing quite in the same size and duration that these bigger ones can fly, but a big step up from where we are today. And again, same idea. Just because it's bigger, it should still be operable with just one or two people. That should be the goal all the time. They should operate a team of these. One person should operate 10 of these instead of 20 people operating one. That should always be the goal. Again, this takes a lot of expertise on software. You have to look at this as a software first problem. How do I minimize the overhead and complexity of this? I think there should be a rule that no new unmanned system can be built with a stick and rudder. Like, nope, we just won't do this anymore. We're going to have these be all autonomous. I don't think anyone will go for that rule, but I think it's a good idea. That's our view. That's our lens through all of these problems is how do we automate as much of the more manual tasks to enable what's just going to be a limited number of operators deployed forward to actually be able to do the intelligence collection, define what they need to find, to do the targeting they need to.",3357
110,Brian Schimpf - Anduril: Building The Future of Defense,Anduril's Guiding Principles and Maintaining Ethics in Defense," Patrick: I'm really interested with that as a backdrop in how you think about what to develop and work on next. And maybe this is a good opportunity to get into some of the guiding principles that you have as a firm, especially around things like ethical considerations. I remember taking just war theory in college and having that be one of my favorite courses. It's such a hard, really sticky, very high stakes problem. And obviously you're right in the middle of it. So as you think about principles that dictate what you choose to build, more requirements like the one you just said, more and more autonomous. Talk to me about that. Your product roadmap is obviously very, very different with higher stakes than a difficult software company. Brian: What do you think through autonomy, there's this dystopian view of those sort of slaughter bots view of the world, which is somehow someone's going to make these robots that go out and autonomously decide to find bad guys and kill them. And it's like literally no one is proposing that in the government. Nobody wants it. It's a bad idea and it wouldn't even work if you wanted it to. It's just not believable. What we've thought about consistently is we want to have these systems provide humans with more agency, more control, and more ability to actually make the right decisions. And this is how any policy framework will work at the end of the day with the DOD, which is we already have weapons that you shoot for. You say there's some sort of target in this area, be it a radar that's emitting. Go find it and blow it up. That is something we do today. That is something where we've said, yep, these are legitimate military targets. We'll have the right targeting process in place to make that decision. But in a lot of ways we will have the systems make decisions about what they will and won't do when they get there. So there is actually a lot of framework around these, but again, the policy framework is the human, the guy that pulled the trigger has accountability over the actions what happened there. Whoever gave the order has accountability over this.So everything we're doing is very much based around the idea of any policy framework we live in and any sort of ethical framework we live in will be based on humans having accountability over the systems, therefore the need to have the right information to make those decisions. The other side of this is AI will be awful at being able to assess contextual things that can't be digitized. All the societal information, what aims you're trying to have, the political objectives of these things. What's an appropriate use of force. What's proportionality. That will be very hard to codify into an objective function. That will be very hard to structure into something that a computer can work with. So humans will be very necessary, rightly so, in every decision making process. So that's one view to this. Another is the privacy and reasonable use of data and technology perspective, which is when we've done these technologies, be it for surveillance or anything we're doing. We always look through the lens of can this be used responsibly? This shows up with how do you retain data? How do you control access to it? How do you make all those pieces go? But then how do you adopt things like we've been asked from time to time to do facial recognition? Our view is it probably won't do what you think it's going to do. And I don't think this is something we can responsibly employ. There's uses where that will work, but not the uses we've been asked for.So we say not really willing to work on that part. It's probably not going to be effective. And I don't think if we gave it to you, it would be possible to use responsibly. So our view to this is as technologists, we have the responsibility to inform the government on what is possible, what can be done responsibly, what cannot, and understand the policy frameworks and the ethical frameworks that largely already exist through a very rigorous process, through a democratic process, and be able to reinforce those and not circumvent them and not short circuit them because you can. The goal is always to live within this framework and handle these things responsibly. From an ethical framework perspective, there is a lot of policy and thinking on this already and our responsibility is to reinforce that and show what can be done in a responsible way. In terms of next technology areas to work on, one of the guiding through line for everything we've done is how can we bring more autonomy to these systems and what that really enables is more scale. So how can I have cheaper and smarter and lower cost systems deployed that change your calculus from okay, if I have to have 20 people managing this, my incentive correctly from the government is I need this to be as expensive and specialized and exquisite of a sensor or a platform as possible. So manpower constraint. So drive up the cost of my platforms. That's the right move. If you can have more AI and autonomy operating these things at scale, it changes the way you think about that cost calculus. And this makes it now so that I can have larger quantities of cheaper systems that I can put at risk. I don't mind if I lose them. They don't need to be as specialized. Maybe I don't even care if people know they're there. It really does change your view on how we can employ these systems. Patrick: To understand the progression of how it's actually worked, maybe you could just list off the actual things that have gone into production that you've worked on that have publicly announced or known just to give people a sense for how it's evolved from that original platform through where we are today. I mean, looking at the pictures of the unmanned submarine, it's a very different looking piece of hardware than where you started. So maybe just list out what you built so far and what each does, and I might have some follow ups on the lineup. Brian: So the first problem we worked on was actually base protection and border security. So when you look at, again, same story of how is this done today? You have cameras, you have radars, and then you have typically several people sitting behind video screens, moving around a joystick, moving the camera around saying, oh, there's something. It's easy to miss things. It's very manpower intensive. And it's just sort of a very inefficient system. So first problem we worked on was could we bring automation intelligence to this very, very quickly? So we built a prototype in three months. We had a pilot on Southern border. And then I think shortly after with Marine Corps to deploy the tech, to learn what worked, what didn't, I think that was within six months. And then within, I want to say about three years, we were in a full scale program of record, which is one of the fastest periods that this has happened in federal government history for quite a while now. Those first system, we deployed scale. There's hundreds of these deployed now, and it's working very well. It's kind of very mature tech. Again, all based on that same core software baseline. The next system, we were able to roll out and get through to production, very similar paths. So the counter drone worked where we solve this problem. We said, all right, well, I think a lot of these techniques for defeating drones today, mostly around jamming or intercepting their communications, those aren't going to work for very long. People are going to figure out that's how this is working and adapt very quickly. So we thought a straightforward solution for knocking out these small drones was to make a very fast bracing quadcopter be able to fly out and knock these out of the sky.Again, same sort of timeline. We built a proof of concept in. I want to say it was about 12 weeks, went to a flyoff sponsored by DIU. So Defense Innovation Unit, one of the innovation groups in duty where one of the best performing systems there knocked out a large percentage of the drone threats that were coming against us. From there, we're able to roll that into a pilot proof of concept deployment. Learned a lot, refined the system, had massive evolutions to how we detect and track and identify these drones, like massively increased radars, visual ranges, optical ranges, all these things. And then from there we're able to then roll into a program of record. And I think that one was about two and a half years. So again, very, very fast timeline from first touch through to something at scale. The third one we've had was this ghost drone. So this helicopter drone, that one took a slightly more circuitous path where we've built some prototypes. It turns out early prototypes for things that fly, people aren't super keen on something that flies 90% of the time. It's got to fly a lot higher percentage of that. So went through and got that fully productized. And now that's a very robust, reliable airframe where we're just starting to see production deployment there, but even there with some of the earlier versions, which were still quite good, we had significant adoption with the 2,000 Royal Marines where they adopted this tech to basically be their squad level intelligence drone very, very early on and learned a ton there, deployed there, got a lot of feedback early.We've also grown through the acquisitions as well. So this is like, I think a little bit unique for startups to be as acquisitive as we've been, but in our space, it's kind of the norm. But B, there's a lot of companies who have built themselves up through bootstrapping and growing on their own. And what I think has been unique with a company like ours is we're able to do a lot of the things that maybe they were a part of the total solution, but we're able to help them solve the totality of the solution where we acquired a company that makes air launch, tube launch drones, this company Area-I, very, very cool product. It's deployed a number of different places. So these things can shoot out of a helicopter, out of plane, off the ground, off a ship, be able to go out and conduct intelligence, video imagery, things like that. Very, very cool product. But I think what their interest was is getting to the next level, having company that can do the business development, the government relations, all the software pieces, integrating field service, all these things you need to sell to the duty. It's quite unique. Dive was another one that we recently acquired that makes these large underwater vehicles where these things go hundreds of kilometers, weeks at a time. Very, very cool. About 20 feet long, six feet diameter, pretty big unmanned vehicle. They come out of Defense World. They'd previously been through a defense acquisition. It's a very bad time. They left to start a new company. And I think looking at it, they said, this gives us the ability to accelerate a lot faster, where we can have more holistic solution. And that's worked out very, very well for us.",2351
111,Brian Schimpf - Anduril: Building The Future of Defense,Dealing with Politics and the DOD," Patrick: One of the things that's been surprising in studying the company is how incredibly open you and other leaders have been about innovation in distributing into DOD and open sourcing the playbook there. Ultra selfishly you'd think, okay, you figured out a way to get into a pretty impenetrable place. You've got that beachhead, you can sell a lot of product into that. For business purposes, maybe keep that playbook to yourself. Why that decision then to be actively open about, okay, now here's how we've done it because it seems like you're trying to educate others that maybe even would be competitors of Anduril? Brian: I think our view is this only gets better if there's more people playing in the space. So there's more success. There's more patterns of what works. Our selfish view to this is DOD being a better buyer and having more bites at the apple of how to do this net helps. The more selfless view is for a lot of us, this is very much about a national security problem. There's a lot easier ways to make a buck than working on this. You get punched in the face every day. It's always like climbing uphill. It's hard working in duty. And for a lot of us, it is very much a mission problem. We do want to see this succeed and we do want other people to succeed in the space. We're not going to solve all the problems. We're fairly focused in what we do. And other people do need to succeed here. There needs to be fresh blood coming in. I think for us, that is a big part of it. We just want to see the space get better and our belief is then if it gets better as a buyer, that's just better for us as well. Patrick: How do you handle politics? I'll just use that broad word as it relates to building and running the business. I think naively people might look at Anduril and say, it's probably a certain political affiliation or comes from a political tradition or something like that. I think that's not true starting with you, but maybe describe the nuance there because I think it's important to understand. Brian: Myself, I'm a lifelong Democrat, give to Democrats all the time, have always sort of identified on more the liberal end of the spectrum. We've got folks like Palmer, sort of lifelong Democrats and has attracted a fair bit of attention for his views. The interesting thing is, especially in defense, it's a massively bipartisan issue. People really do believe a stronger US security position is net better, not just for the US, but for the world. You see what happens with Ukraine when we don't have our allies with the ability to really defend themselves. At the end of the day, I think really there's going to be a spectrum of ways we support allies. It's going to be economically, it's going to be diplomatically. And ultimately, they do need to have the hard power to be able to withstand an aggressor. It just gets there sometimes. I don't think on the whole defense is actually particularly controversial. I think it was for a while. There's a reason we're not in Silicon Valley. It was a period of time around 2017 where I think it was just very controversial to do anything with the federal government. Our view was doing this in places where there's a more broad view, very similar to the rest of America, where defense is one of the most popular things in America.It's one of the most wildly supported aspects of American life. Internally, we've actually been extremely apolitical. There's no political chat on Slack. There's no conversations about these sort of issues. It's about the mission we're working on and it's pretty straightforward. That's what people talk about. And I think we've said that's how we're going to run the company. And we've been very open about what we do here. We work on defense. We work on weapons. That is a reality. We talk about it thoughtfully. We care a lot about what we do. We try to be very ethical and reasonable in our approaches. We're not cowboys with this. We take it very seriously. I think that's worked incredibly well for us. We've just been very open and honest about what we do. And I think people really do respond to that certitude and confidence and clarity. And I think people really do respond to that leadership. Patrick: What are the most difficult classes of decisions that you as the leader of the business have had to make through the business' history? Is there some consistent thing that is just always hard and probably always will be hard? Brian: Probably the hardest is really picking on what to work on. There's a lot of things we could do. There's a lot of problems to solve and these things are very expensive. You have to have a lot of conviction that A, there's a buyer here. If we build this, will someone show up and actually want to scale this with us? Are we solving a real problem? This has led us into sort of a mindset that I think is pretty unique in the space where we're not working in R&D for hire. We're not just responding to proposals. We're very much looking mission first and saying, what are the real problems that need to be solved and how can technology actually move these forward? And if we brought this forward to the customer, would they actually do this? And I think a lot of this has been informed by a pretty broad base of our team, where we have folks that are something like 20% vets.We have engineers from big tech, from defense primes, from everywhere. We have folks from the Hill, from government, all over the place. So it's a really pretty diverse view of folks who can look at this problem in a lot of different ways and say, this is what needs to be to solved, this what's not. But these are big consequential decisions. We'll dedicate a team to these things for years. It'll cost us a ton of money and we just have to have an outrageously high average with success on these things. And the nature of our business is very much going to be there isn't one product that will scale to billions of dollars. I think we'll get there with some of these bigger hardware products where they will be very large successes in and of themselves, but we know we're going to have to have this sort of approach of multiple products that sort of each sell into some part of the market, and that's a very hard decision to make where we're sort of constantly evaluating it, reevaluating what we've invested in, how can we get better signal, and then how quickly can we get to something to prove that there's actually interest and traction in the market? Patrick: If you think about the recent news where you were awarded the billion dollar contract, I think by SOCOM, you've come a long way, that's obviously a huge number. If you were to rewind time before you had had this established relationship with DOD what was the absolute low point in you trying to penetrate them as a buyer for the first time? What is the story of how you overcame whatever that challenging period was? Brian: Maybe I can hit one or two vignettes that I think highlight sort of challenges in working with DOD. One was we had a great early adopter with Marine Corps on using our towers for base protection, and I think this is the pattern a lot of people fall into where these were the operational users. These are guys who were responsible for protecting the bases, managing the bases. So we did a pilot with them a year or two where we deployed, I think 30 different towers across four or five different bases. Users loved it. The success was great. Efficacy was high. There was a lot of demand for it. Then the thing that I think everyone finds very surprising about DOD is the people who have the operational mission are in no way in charge of the budget or buying decisions whatsoever. So they said, ""Hey, we want this. This is great tech. We want to roll it out."" Then I think working through the process of what is the requirement? Okay, you've this requirement, validated, signed off on and that takes time, then where does this fit into the budget cycle? The budget is decided two to three years in advance of the year where you will actually be able to do this. So when we were starting as a company, they were deciding the budget for when we actually wanted to get funding two or three years later for this technology that was then proven to work. So it wasn't even invented at the time they had written the budget for that year.Again, it's like, everyone's well intentioned, they're trying to manage this in the sane way, but the system has gotten so slow and structured to be so slow that when you start having these more innovative technologies, these things that move very quickly, the ability to react, respond even on pretty low dollar value things compared to the $700 billion budget of the DOD, it is very, very hard to move quickly. I think that's probably one of the best versions of DOD in a nutshell, which is like great tech. It works, people want it, wait three years, probably five, by the time requirement, then budget, then everything shows up. That's the timelines you're really looking at, which is quite hard. Now there's people trying to move this faster, a lot of innovative approaches to making this go, but it's slow and that slowness can be very disheartening. I think the part that's probably hardest for folks in DOD to understand is they have not worked at a startup, they have not had to show top line numbers. I don't want to say they're unsympathetic, but it's certainly not something that resonates clearly around. If you want innovative companies to show up and stick around, these are the things they have to put up. These are the numbers they have to show. We've been able to work through that and still be able to put up great numbers, but it's certainly not without its challenges and we are in a lot of ways working against the system as design. Patrick: Do you think that ultimately you will change that, change the way that DOD does its job so that the deployment of useful operational tools can happen on the tighter feedback cycle? Brian: I don't want to take too much credit for it. It's going to be a lot of different people working to like solve this, but our hope is we can demonstrate successful models. We can put forward new ideas. Nearly every idea we've put forward has had a lot of traction and an uptake. Our GC put out a proposal for a different model of software IP rights and has gotten a ton of interest in running a pilot on this, even very weensy things like that. We thought 20 people would read the article, turns out, maybe it was 30. They were all pretty interested. There's a lot of interest in pushing these things forward, and I do think there is a lot of more macro reforms and things like that people are considering. There's a commission to look at the PPBE. I think it's the planning, programming, budgeting, and execution process. They established a commission to look at, how can we go faster? How can we solve these things differently?So there's a lot more momentum, and I think a lot of that is due to China, honestly, and the pace that they're able to develop new technology. I think it's not as obvious to most people, I think the top folks in duty really get it, but the pace is everything. If Silicon Valley has figured out anything, it's compounding is very good. If you compound twice as fast, even if you're a little bit worse, you're still better off, and the pace of being able to evolve, change, get new tech out. That is everything. So if China can get new capabilities out in three to five years, and it takes us seven to 10, doesn't matter if we're starting at a better position, they're going to blow past us very, very fast. I think there's a recognition that speed of compounding, that speed of iteration plus the pace to fielding is so critical. It actually may be the most critical thing. There is a lot of energy and momentum to change around this.",2684
112,Brian Schimpf - Anduril: Building The Future of Defense,Lessons For Technology Startups and More," Patrick: Even though the world's biggest company is a hardware company, the well worn phrase is hardware is hard and to invest in hardware businesses has been, sometimes it's burned everyone that's tried, and it's just really difficult. It's more difficult than moving bits around. So since you're in the business of both bits and atoms, what could you teach us about hardware innovation compounding and doing that effectively? What are the big lessons that if you were to go to just some random hardware startup, you would bring with you on working on hardware given your experience at Anduril. Brian: Coming from a software background, you're a SaaS company. What do you hire? Software engineers, maybe you get some front end specialists, you think that's really different, and then you get designers and some PMs. Probably four disciplines, you've some sales guys, pretty straightforward. You go to hardware, it is dozens of specialists. The variety of folks you need in terms of electrical design, electrical tests, mechanical design, the testing pieces there, manufacturing, specialists in manufacturing, supply chain logistics. It just gets very complex, very fast. It's certainly not for the faint hearted. It's much harder operationally. The thing I think in the valley that has worked so well was, and why velocity has gotten so high is the cost of change, the cost to rework is basically zero. You just roll it out, and a lot of the tech investment has been how do I move faster and make stuff cheap to roll out and make changes cheap? That's worked very, very well, and again, get that velocity up. It's very, very effective. The hardware world, you can do that depending on the problem set. Maybe the biggest lesson we've had is how do we, as cheaply as possible get to test out product market fit. That's the main lesson we've tried to drive, which is how can I cheaply get to a prototype that is not fieldable, that is not robust, but it is something I can see? Is there a buyer?Would they actually move on this? Are they trying to pull me along or am I pushing uphill and trying to fight to get this adopted? There's dozens of companies making these midsize drones at this point. There's a lot of questions of like range and payload and all these things, and it's hard to sort of test those until you get something in front of somebody flying and say, ""What problem would this solve for you?"" Because they just don't believe you until the things flying or working or doing something. So a lot of the approach we try to take is very cheaply getting to that first prototype, that first article and bringing customers along the journey with us say, is this interesting to you? Is this solving a real problem and getting that buy-in as early as possible. The extreme form of it is what the DOD's done historically, which is they come with the idea, you just do cost plus contracts and they absorb all the risk. But the intermediate form that we started doing with the Australians for example, is this co-investment strategy where historically we would just build a big sub, get to a prototype and then get it to production quickly, there where we're able to work with them to validate, yeah this is actually really interesting, and if we can hit the price points and features that they're really looking for, they would 100% want to scale this.So it allows us to shave years off the development timeline and allow us to go much harder, where we can just skip to production much, much faster. So this is something we've been seeing with the US as well as trying to find these blended strategies where we still have skin in the game, we still have an incentive to move fast and we're not trying to make an R&D business that was more successful the longer and worse these things go, but to make a business that we have a real ability to shape roadmap, deliver something that works, but also get a customer really bought in on the journey and see us as a partner to actually solve a real problem for them, instead of having to guess, and then go hunt. We've kind of been playing with both strategies, we'll continue just to do things that we have conviction in, totally independent customers, but then to the extent we can really get that buy-in early, I think it really helps. But the reality is just getting something into prototype. You can do that pretty quick. So if someone's out there starting a hardware company, unless it's consumer hardware where nobody cares about a prototype, you can really try to learn the space fast and learn what you don't know, then really getting those customers bought in, they would run through brick walls for this, then you have something. Patrick: Is there a moment in Anduril's history as a business so far that you are most proud of looking back on? Brian: I'm very happy that the government is kind of moving at this pace. So being able to see these bigger programs move in such a timeline and get the tech adoption, despite all the past conceptions of these things. So be it with Customs and Border Protection, SOCOM, that's always really impactful. Probably the things that are most exciting are really just mission wins. That's the stuff I get really excited about when it's deployed and it solves real problem. Those are the things that I really feel the most motivated by. They're consequential problems when you move the needle on it. Sounds corny, but it actually like, wow, that mattered. That mattered a lot. Those are the things that I personally get most excited by seeing the pace at which we've been able to get people excited, get government really moving in a way that it was different than I thought. I thought it was going to be a lot harder. I thought it was going to take a lot longer. It's still hard. I thought it was going to take 10 years. Patrick: What about the other side of that coin? Looking back, any major moments of regret or things that you would've done differently? Brian: Honestly, not many major decisions that I can think of that we felt like we made major mistakes on. I think a lot of the learning along the way has been for me as a software person has been on the hardware side of how do we actually build these things for production? What does that really mean, and how do you get them reliable? I do think that's very hard and we're learning a lot of hard lessons on that as we go along, like how long does this take to get a drone to the point of reliability, really happy with it? What sort of testing do you have to do? What sort of rigorous kind of process you have to do, and how do we adapt that to being able to move really fast and balance those things? I think those have been hard learnings. I don't know that anyone has the answers. We know what a traditional aircraft program looks like. It's like five to seven years of systems engineering, and then pop to the side, hopefully you got an aircraft that works. But taking this more iterative approach and really learning what's the right people, processes and right way to blend both worlds, I think has been a really interesting learning experience. Patrick: If you think about the very small, but hopefully growing list of companies like Anduril that face the government, that are tackling these hard problems, maybe the two that preceded it that are important, one of which you worked at Palantir, or Palantir and SpaceX, what did you learn from those two companies, either working there or observing them that you think are useful lessons for people thinking about this class of problems? Brian: The Palantir case was really a lesson on how do you sell and work with the government, both from plug an operational view, how does security work? How does contracting work? All those things, which are extremely not obvious, and if you don't know, it'll take years to figure it out. Then really from a business development perspective of what works? What doesn't? Where are they going to help you? Where are they not? What is something they're willing to buy? The really hard lesson is they buy systems and capabilities, they don't buy parts. That's quite a bit different than if you're a cybersecurity company, it's very hard to just go sell to the government cause they want to buy a secured network. They don't want to buy another tool that they have to then deploy, manage, install, and operate. The second piece we really learned there was going through the, being a subcontractor, doing a small part doesn't work. You don't have control over your destiny. These larger companies are well incentivized to minimize your revenue and contribution and maximize their ownership and unique positioning, the very rational incentives. They want to be a unique value add. They want you to be as not unique and as commodity as possible. So you just can't go through these traditional players easily, unless you have something truly unique that they cannot get any other way. But even then it's like, how fast can you scale? You're on their timelines. They're disincentivized from making you the centerpiece of why this is the right technology.I think the SpaceX lesson's a little bit different in that is a class of technology that nobody thought someone outside of the DOD world could do. There was this beliefs like, oh, they can't build these rockets. There's no way, only Boeing and Lockheed consortium can do it. Obviously not true. It's like, ""Well, they can't do it cheaply."" Obviously not true. They went from not having any satellites to being the largest constellation operator in two years, and people like, ""Oh, it won't work."" It's like, it obviously will work. The degree to which they've been able to completely shame everyone and the pace and scale and innovative approaches that they've been able to do on what is considered some of the most difficult and hard to access technologies is incredible. It's just wild. I think it shows that there's really no space that these legacy players uniquely will be able to control. I think it is something where everyone should look at it and say, ""Well, this is one of the hardest areas of tech and they did it and they did it on their own dollar and they did it faster than anyone thought was possible."" The story we often tell is both of these guys had to Sue the government to succeed. In Palantir's case, it was, they had the right tech and the government refused to consider commercial solutions and instead kept rolling their own tech, which was expensive, not delivering, and there was just the very willful disregard for looking at alternative approaches.I think in the SpaceX case, pretty similar, a willful disregard for looking at alternatives. That still exists, if something is locked in and not an approach, it's very hard to get them to changed course, because the incentives and the system and the government are, if you admit that your approach was wrong, you will be punished. Not that you picked a better approach it's that you were wrong before. So it's very hard to drive this change because Congress will yell at you. Your superiors will yell at you, you'll not get promoted because you were picking a prior bad strategy. So it's not set up to adopt new approaches on the whole. So it requires an admission of failure, not an acknowledgement of success. So it is quite hard. So largely where we've tried to focus is then don't require an admission of failure. If you go after those areas, you will be fighting forever and probably will still lose. It'll be so expensive and so painful. So we've tried to target areas where it's novel. There's not an existing approach and this is something truly new and technology has changed, that enables something that you didn't think was possible before, and that's something people can really get behind and I think has enabled us to succeed very, very well. Patrick: I think it's just an incredible lesson to close on such an interesting business that you're building and have built already. I've learned a lot from it. It's completely unique in the lineup of businesses that I've explored for sure. Just like you said, end of one type company. I ask everyone the same traditional closing question. What is the kindest thing that anyone's ever done for you? Brian: Kind and nice are very different words. One of the kindest things in the course of our business was when we were working on counter drone systems, we had kind an early champion and he beat us multiple times to perform better and give us a chance and say, ""You need to step it up."" That was actually one of the best things that has happened to us in terms of really putting real pressure on us to succeed, but in a way that he wanted us to succeed. That to me was that belief and that willingness to trust us and work with us, that was one of the best things that's happened to us and really was one of the kindest things that took a lot of courage on his part. Not the nicest, but definitely one of the kindest things. Patrick: I love that distinction. There is a category of these answers that is tough love, that wouldn't be there if the question was nicest thing. I don't think anyone's made that exact distinction, but I love it as an example, and Brian I'm so appreciative of your time today, thanks so much for having this conversation.

113,Tobi Lutke - Embrace the Unexpected,Introduction," Patrick: My guest today is Tobi Lütke, co-founder and CEO of Shopify. Having first spoken to Tobi at the beginning of the pandemic, just two months into it, this felt like an opportune moment to revisit Shopify and the world through Tobi's eyes. Among many things, we discussed Shopify's evolution into the world of atom-based building, through Shopify's fulfillment network, the value of infrastructure writ large, and the impact of market volatility on day-to-day business building. Please enjoy my conversation with Tobi Lütke.",134
114,Tobi Lutke - Embrace the Unexpected,Value of Infrastructure," Patrick: Tobi, it is almost exactly two years to the day since we last did this. It was early May in 2020, there was still a ton of uncertainty related to COVID. I guess there still is some extent today, and the world in Shopify and lots of things have changed a tremendous amount. I know certain things haven't changed too. I've been really excited to do an updated version of our conversation and we'll bounce all over the place, but before we hit go here, we're having this fascinating conversation around the concept of infrastructure, generally speaking. I think it started with this idea that we might be about to come on stream to a lot of good, useful, new, history books written by people who are really there to see this stuff get built in the digital world. I'd love you to sum up that idea of what your interest is in infrastructure and the way that history is written. Even things like payback on infrastructure and the ways in which we might underestimate it. I think this is a great tone setter for what we're going to be talking about today. Tobi: I'm thrilled to be back. Thanks for having me and those were quite some two years and a lot has happened. I think people are just underestimating the value to society of infrastructure by some incredible factor, because you see these kind of things like the interstate system. How do you imagine this thing would've looked if these things wouldn't have been built? I'm not an atoms person, I'm more like a bytes person. I find that infrastructure, especially with software has this incredibly unreasonable leverage and unreasonable payback period and often we have these conversations about what's the state of planet earth. What are things truly like? Are things getting better? Are things getting worse? There's a lot of people sharing excellent opinions on these things.There's a website. I hope I say this right. I think what happened in 1971, it might be a different year, but something around that time, there's a collection of charts where once the right year comes around, a lot of numbers sort of disconnect from their previous correlations. I have no idea what happened in that year, but as a student of history and especially of digital history, increasingly I'm thinking about a very, very tangible thing that happened is that just simply most of the value creation in the world has slipped out of the things that is represented in GDPs, where a whole bunch of people built the upper net around this time then we got modern operating systems.We've built a lot of silicon based computers in the nineties, but none of this was reflected anywhere. Dot com happened and everyone tried on the idea like that this tech could be very big and then found some of the ground truth to be wanting, but really sort of early mid 2000s, web 2.0 I think we call it or, at least coinciding with the emergence of that term, I think was the moment where the world of technology said, Hey, we actually know exactly how to provide value for everyone. We know exactly how to deliver services and goods and things over the internet.And by the way, there's a lot of tweaks on the intuitions that people develop in the physical world. Physical world is very rivalrous. If you build a bridge in one place, you probably don't build a bridge somewhere else. At some point in the world of atoms, things become zero sum, limited amount of attention at the very least and then resources as well. The digital word is different. Basically you have Turing machines, you load something on a silicon chip into memory, and then you apply electricity and you get this thing. Infrastructure and internet. I mean, I like to believe Shopify is infrastructure, but there's public domain libraries. Just pick one, you know, SQLite. It's like a library, probably none of your listeners have heard about, but you have probably like something to the tune of a hundred SQLite databases on your phone right now.It's just file format of the world basically and increasingly runs more and more and more parts on servers as well. It's just this brilliant open public domain piece that was written by a team and great leadership, incredible conviction, but it's not software, it’s infrastructure. And now people are using it every day for different things. And no one has to decide if we use SQLite, that means someone else can also have SQLite because all of us just add electricity. What that stores then is like an unbelievable compounding value.Again, in a lot of the ways we look at the world through GDP and other things, it's impossible to capture the value that's created here. Everytime someone updates something on GitHub, theoretically, it can be copied infinite amounts of times. These are not new ideas I'm sharing here, obviously. In a way, we've talked about this zero marginal cost of software and of course it powers a lot of value in a lot of software companies. I'm starting to believe that we haven't fully set this idea to its logical conclusion. How much of a change will this cause over the next while? Patrick: If you think about its compounding effects and the return or payoff pattern to infrastructure in general, do you think that's the reason why certainly in the world of atoms, it seems like we're unwilling to re-up the same way we did and say it under Eisenhower the 1950s or something doesn't seem to be that will, because it's very expensive. It takes a long time to build and then it's a very long lived asset and maybe digital those things were all exacerbated. Do you think that in general, we're also not building enough digital infrastructure given this idea? It certainly seems like Shopify and others are building tons of tooling. APIs are everywhere. This is a big trend, but is one of the conclusions from this it's not nearly big enough because of its potential payoff? Tobi: There wasn't a lot until recently. I think there's been a counter swing. I think we will only feel the effects of this, even blockchains, infrastructure, you put a smart contract on a blockchain it'll also run forever. In fact, the smart contracts that people put on blockchains are potentially the pieces of software that will live the longest. They might be still executable and callable in millions of years. In some cases. Now I'm making a very big assumption of the future viability of blockchains, but assuming blockchains are going to be part of what we'll do, they'll be around, which is exciting. That's the equivalent of a park. Your city builds a park, that's a piece of infrastructure. That park can be used for events. All sorts of new things can be done with that. We could make open source code, which was the blueprints, which then could be loaded into Turing machines, but we didn't have persistent Turing machines that forever execute, which we do now have, although very inefficiently right now.So I think a lot of pieces are being put in place for kind of a new deal on the internet. Hosting is becoming much simpler again. Work GitHub has been done over the last 15 years, is very underappreciated in the way it created a community around people just sort of helping each other. You see increasingly really great companies that are just really either all in on infrastructure like Twilio or Stripe or Adyen, or like take a lot of this infrastructure, add a little bit of its own infrastructure, but really customize it in such a way that it's super available to non-technical people like that's I think what Shopify is doing. Obviously, I think this is insanely valuable. I spent all my day working on these kind of things and I like to invoke all this because I think maybe sort of I'm feeling the times, but there isn't a lot of optimism around and I feel there's so much to be optimistic about and so I’m trying to apply a little counterforce to that particular pendulum. Patrick: Yeah. It's amazing how much prevailing market conditions and prices can impact people's mood. We'll talk about that a little bit later, sticking with infrastructure though. I wonder if you've developed any principles or principle thinking around what makes for better infrastructure or valuable infrastructure to build. And I asked this question from a place of Shopify zone history. When we last talked a lot of the things that if you go to Shopify's website and see what you can do as a merchant didn't even exist two years ago. So you've obviously had to make choices. We're going to build this. We're going to not build this. What do you think about in terms of just base level principles that help you with decision making, for what kind of infrastructure to build that will have the most leverage in the world? Tobi: There are some guiding principles in Shopify product that really help us make these decisions. For instance, there's a very basic sentence, which actually does a lot of work within the company. “Shopify wants to make the important easy and everything else possible.” Probably everyone who listens to this has bought from Shopify stores. You might have not known that it was a Shopify store because they look very, very different. This is powered by a template language I wrote forever ago called Liquid. Basically the merchants can open a text editor and just make their website look however they want, or buy a theme from someone. That's infrastructure in a way, because here's something I learned about infrastructure, which might sound very abstract, but maybe it's useful. If you imagine an hourglass. An hourglass has sort of a narrow waist at some point, maybe a comic book version of an hour glass is like two triangles, inverted pointing at each other. Great infrastructure can be done when you can define what this sort of narrow waist is between the triangles. For instance, let's use Stripe because it makes this point I think quite well. There's one triangle on top, which is the internet, and all the engineers, and all the developers. They have a set of desires. They want to accomplish tasks, which involve movement of money. And then there's a bottom triangle, which is like a world of COBOL code in banks. There's a lot going on. And a lot of things you need to know, but if you manage to create a thin waist in this case, in the form of an API, now you have an agreement in the middle. This almost acts as a protocol. Here's the fantastic thing. Once this protocol exists, it actually allows the two triangles to be replaced over time. In the case of something like Shopify, Liquid is again this templating language. People can write it. If you wrote some in 2005, the first time the Shopify went into Beta, it will still work.Shopify is the Ship of Theseus. Nothing about Shopify is the same. The Liquid part has been rewritten many, many times, everything changed about the triangle below. Everything changed about the triangle above. Most people don't actually even write Liquid. They actually just use drag and drop editor, which we built on top, which then writes the Liquid for you. The amazing thing is, again, once the protocol has been defined, once the demarcation line has been created, once the narrow risk is defined, then really incredible things can happen because as long as the thing keeps working, that's in the middle, you can evolve all the pieces. And I think that's a really, really, really powerful idea for product creation. People encounter this. If you've ever queried a database again, you use sequel and that's just a thin waist system. It's an agreed upon system, which gets you the data and as long as you keep it simple, if you send something to Microsoft SQL Server or SQLite, you'll get the answer assuming they have the data. So that idea unlocks, I think, the right approach to internet infrastructure creation, because once these protocols have been defined, teams can go and saying, okay, these sort of made this work with duct tape and regular expressions in terms of Liquid, but let's build this up properly, scale it out, make it so that people can use this from now on forever. Patrick: So someone once explained it to me as the equivalent of an outlet in your wall, that's become standard that anything you plug into it like electricity flows through it very reliably and in a way that's a standard or a protocol or something that is sitting right next to us all day every day, that without it, who knows what would've been invented. I'm also struck by the examples being the choke points, if you will, the most basic natural things that humans have been doing forever, like Stripe people in paying stuff, Twilio, communicating, Shopify, selling, buying. How much do you think just that is the guide for good infrastructure just looking for the longest lasting perennial human use cases and then starting from there? Maybe they've all been mined. I'm curious how much room you think there is left to go talking, paying, some of these things I've listed are like the major human motions. But I think my sense from you is that we're still pretty early in digital infrastructure building. So how do you think about that? Tobi: Some parts are and some aren't. It's sometimes very, very surprising, which ones aren't. Other things that are very, very long lasting is ownership. People like owning things. We like to acquire assets. We like to have title to them. This is not just the utilitarian value. This is also for starters and for all sorts of reasons that are uniquely human and we didn't have good infrastructure for this. We probably still have not great infrastructure for this. It's just barely becoming possible to own things on the internet. I think there's lots of white space.I do fully agree though that one of the best things you can spend some time thinking about is what are things that people have been doing for a very long time. If I've been doing something for a very long time, like making something on the internet that taps into this emotion or into this sense for community or whatever that is you identified. I think you can analyze almost every major success story in the digital space right now and you really see a digital version of something that people have already been doing, which tells you how early it is. They're pre the emergence of new things. Maybe the video game world is sort of there, but I think we are spending our time on computers, on the internet, very, very different right now than people will in 20 years from now. So there's plenty of opportunity to be part of being pioneers. Patrick: So when you think about this applied specifically to Shopify and let's just call it like a funnel of ideas for marginal infrastructure that could get built, or I guess, improvements to existing pieces of infrastructure. How does that funnel work? How are ideas fed into the top of it? What are the layers of decision making that ultimately lead to something getting green lit? What is the way that that product funnel works, given the amount of white space that might exist? Tobi: We were talking about last time, the sort of difference over the last two years. I think that we've gotten a lot better at this and spent a lot of time thinking about this because frankly here's an experience I've had. When the COVID pandemic and the stay at home orders happened and we all did that two years ago. It was very clear that this is going to be a very, very, very white knuckle affair for everyone. There was untold stories there still, like, I mean, the world almost ran out of service in a very significant way, but probably most people don't quite understand how close of a call that was. If COVID would've happened like two years before, I'm not sure we could have pulled off, not we as in Shopify, but the internet. The Cloud hosting providers, they're like very close to food rationing. A lot happened during this time. I pulled the entire list of things that everyone was working on and basically recalibrated everything from like, does this help right now? I'm a very vocal proponent of long term thinking. People should make decisions based on the decision they assume the company 10 years from now wishes they would've done, but sometimes you got to just look at what's there and be very, very practical. So I went through. In the end, I think I stopped about 60% of what we were working on. None of the things we were working on was because people made incorrect choices. Sometimes just maybe not quite applying the larger frame of reference.For instance, there's a lot of projects to customize Shopify to be better for brochures and so on. I understand the pitch of like that's so and so big market and if you just get 1%, this is not my favorite form of communication, but I recognize that it happens. So a lot of the projects have been going on we're trying to drag Shopify into adjacencies. I'm a very firm believer that you have to pick your place and then try to be ideal for that. And actually maybe to a certain point actually discourage people to pull your product into areas it's not meant for, because Shopify should be the best piece of software everyone uses who's in our space. Because like cheap, and fast, and delightful, and is an integration point, and simplifies the business, and magically anticipates the next step, and has something, a product, good service for you that can just help you do your thing. Shopify wants to be the mushroom to Mario or the fire flower to Mario, or just give you powers that are awesome. Moving it in all these adjacencies increases the TAM, but it stratifies it into concentric circles. For some people it's going to be ideal in this way, but for many people it will be just never quite there. And I think that can actually have some really negative effects for feedback and all these kind things on companies.Anyway, from this, we learn we need to have a really good mechanism by which we get the best of what we have. Shopify is very bottoms up. People can write proposals for every opportunity they see that goes into a system called GSD, which stands for get shit done. Then there's these phases there's proposal phase, prototype phase, build phase, and a releasing phase, and this system allows everyone in the company to see everything that's going on. This entire plan once a year I write product themes for a company, things that we cause to make true over the year. And then they sort of decompose into different projects. Then as this proposal is submitted for transition to the build phase or to prototype phase, and then we can have great conversations about, is this a not yet? Is this a hell yes? Where does this go in a priority stack? And I think building this out has been incredibly clarifying and very, very good for the company. So a lot of the work I think over the last two years has been to get companies just really, really, really aligned on their missions. Companies can get very, very distracted in a lot of ways when they allow themselves to do things that aren't the mission. This is especially true in a world of product. Again, if you follow a moving into adjacencies, I don't think you will have a world class product in your adjacencies. You're not out competing someone's main mission with your side quest. Patrick: If we go back in time and think about the number of potential ways or companies trying to solve this kind of problem, eCommerce infrastructure, there were a lot of them through history and Shopify has emerged as the clear winner I would say, or the default, as if you're going to build an online presence you do with Shopify and there's other options, but it's sort of the default mode. Is there anything that you most attribute that success to in 2005 through, let's say through 2020, then we'll talk about this kind of modern era as a separate segment and popping to mind is we're talking about finite infinite games, the great James Carse book and this great talk that I love called inventing on principle. You started this to sell snowboards. I don't know how much of this was a grand ambition of yours versus the unfolding of following a certain set of principles. So I would love just like level set on that early period and why you think you won relative to a lot of people trying to solve a similar problem. Tobi: It's really hard to attribute it to one thing. I can guess the things that contributed. I mean, luck and timing. People luck, timing luck. All these things are really, really big factors in here. And I think Shopify succeeded, if you press me on one thing, it's people luck. We've had an incredibly hardworking, aligned team of people who work together for a very long time and like all fall in love with the problem. And have a curiosity wanting to understand every atom of a space we are trying to solve problems in and through the group and through the chats, like manage to see what ought to exist rather than about what does, and that is a vision. And that is a thing that you can then execute against. James Carse's book is really meaningful to me, partly because I love the way he describes what infinite journeys are. He talks about it like you start with some kind of a vision set out towards some horizon that you find interesting. Starting out on curiosity. The goal is not trying to reach horizon because that would make it a finite game. The goal is actually just make it towards horizon so that you gain more vision. I find that cycle to be intoxicating. I love thinking about Shopify as a journey, because again, I sold snowballs and I built software in an obscure Japanese programming language, which captured everyone's imagination and pushed attention to my snowboard store, which felt very unearned, but sort of happened. The other thing that JamesCarse talks about in his book is that the biggest functional difference between people engaged in playing finite games, something like tennis, where you're trying to win based on score, or infinite games is a relationship to change. If you are playing a finite game, the rules need to be defined ahead of time because there's a winning condition and if a game's over, then all participants agree it's over because some condition has been met. The infinite game has no such facility. In fact, all change is interesting. Change actually causes the journey to go differently, go more precisely. You work on it. Frankly, that's also useful psychology right now and for all of the last two years that this decade seems to be really prioritizing rewarding the adaptable. If your reaction to change is fight it and try to revert to what has been before, I think you're in for a really bad time. This is meaningful to me and it's the way I've been thinking about the company. I think this attitude, partly itself, has caused some of the success, frankly, because I'm surprised all the things that fell into scope for us. Because again, when I started, Shopify is by no means the first eCommerce software company. There were a lot of other things there, and there was an entire industry. So this was reasonably established, but I never felt I joined that industry, but I solved problems that took me through this terrain. I think that's helpful because there was also a point of sale industry, which I don't think that's a separate thing. You're solving a similar problem in another form factor. Usually, it should be connected to the same infrastructure in the end. That was obvious to us. And then all the work we've done through multichannel.Shopify is playing a very different role. It's your data warehouse. Sometimes it's your business coach, it's your bank, your financier. It plays a role that is hugely utilitarian to a kind of people who are engaged with the entrepreneurial journey. That has never been defined by someone saying, ""This is the confines of an industry,"" but it's actually been set by us just keeping on this journey and figuring out where to go next, always talking a lot with our customers and having a really good understanding for the challenges they face. And I think this takes us into all these places that we could never have anticipated. Like now, we are building warehouses and robots and all these kind of things. I didn't think that would be part of a journey, but it clearly is. And I think it's good to be humble and not have too many assumptions about the future, but rather develop a very, very strong sense of; figure out what's right. What is their overwhelming evidence for? And then react to that.",5281
115,Tobi Lutke - Embrace the Unexpected,Shopify Fulfillment Network," Patrick: People are probably less familiar with that example you ended on, Shopify fulfillment network. I would love just to take that as a microcosm of these ideas and maybe explain literally what it is to people. But I'm especially interested in its evolution. Why, obviously you were incredibly good at purely digital infrastructure. And one of the things that's interesting that's happened in COVID is forced the digital and the physical to smash together out of necessity, as you pointed out, thank God for the internet during COVID, and pushed everyone into this intersection unless often atoms or bits only. Maybe start by saying, what is Shopify network today? And then really, I'd love to hear on how it evolved and how it began, because I think it would be a great way to get into your company in your head about this kind of decision making and where to go next. Tobi: I'm on WhatsApp threads with probably 100 merchants. And from all backgrounds, I just talk to people and then I upgrade us into a chat. And then we talk about what works, and what doesn't. And very quickly, this usually becomes talk about the business rather than the software, because the software hopefully works really well. But that's actually even more helpful because it just gives you a sense for where do things get really complicated? Our observation with Shopify has always been that the journey is uphill. It's not easy. Shopify never claims it is. Entrepreneurship is fundamentally a little bit unreasonable. There's wonderful quotes, not by me, where people point out that you end up spending 100 hours a week working for yourself so you don't have to work 40 hours for someone else. Often this doesn't make sense, but again, for some people it's super important. And frankly, for our economies, it's really important that people do this because most people in the world are employed by small and medium businesses. There's about five and a half million people employed by the millions of merchants on Shopify. And that's very, very meaningful. We talk with them. What we found is it's an uphill journey, which is okay. Everyone's willing to do this because it's very gritty people who embark. But if it becomes a technical climb, it filters out a lot of people.A lot of people just opt out of the journey, basically just forgo future growth at a point where things become very, very obscure. This actually started really early. Once upon a time, for instance, actually one example was just getting a payment gateway. I know this sounds crazy that the internet was ever like this. But when Shopify started and saw a lot of parts of the internet, it was very hard to get a payment gateway. That's trivial now because it's built in, you just get one. So we build up the infrastructure, us and our partners to just underwrite people. And then this particular technical climb disappears. It becomes just a slope, which again, everyone will continue on. You actually have more entrepreneurship because some obstacle like this was overcome. Think about the importance of tooling infrastructure and also UX here. There are significantly more people employed today because of good UX and not getting people to be stuck and integrating more. I think this is really overlooked part of the effects of this type of friction. This is really how Shopify thinks about what we do next. People have lots of problems accessing capital from banks. Banks have in charter that the point of why they get these privileges, especially retail banks, which they have, is so that they lend money to small businesses, because that's, again, a huge return on investment for society if that happens. However, banks do not want to do this anymore. You have to give up. And some point realistically, that's how it should work. But in reality, they want to lend money to companies that have huge revenue, it's lower risk. It makes sense, but that means they disappeared from playing an important infrastructure role in society. So then we have Shopify capital, because people are willing to be underwritten and for advances, and again, their business can grow significantly only even there's capital available to grow business. We are going through all the obstacles.The one that just is a slam dunk thing is it depends on your product somewhat, but at some point, you really have to have a plan for how to get to at least two day, ideally, overnight delivery for products you have. In the past, it was an experience unlike anything else entrepreneurs have done to this point. When they decided to go into a new channel, like sell on Facebook, on Meta or Instagram, that was a click of an app which they added. And when they did that, that's how people are used to growing their business. Getting logistics set up is work with whatever factory and contact manufacturer you have, figure out freight across the Atlantic and Pacific. You then have to find warehouses, it is a completely different world, which involves a lot of different people to talk to and complexities. It just felt very obviously in scope for a long time, that at some point we have to solve this. In fact, I started talking with the board of directors and they wisely told me that this was too early, over 10 years ago, wanting to go into this direction. I think this is important to say. We are doing this not because we want to be in the logistics space, we rather actually don't want to be going into the logistics space. Although it is wonderful and fascinating, and there's lots we can actually bring given our unique experience about processes and digitalization, technology, and digital infrastructure and whatnot. But integrating end-to-end is one of the goals we have. We would like to get to the point where running a sizable retail business could, if you choose, be treated as passive income. We want to automate as many parts of it as possible so that you and your team can focus on product creation, which is the most valuable thing you can be doing. Doing undifferentiated work, figuring out where you have packages, to me that is the digital system just should really know where packages are. Otherwise, what the hell is going on? That's not differentiated work.Now, we found that the more entrepreneurs end up spending time on their product, the better the products get, and this is one of the wonderful things about the direct to consumer world that emerged in the last few years that there's much more alignment between the people making the products and the people getting them. And they're happy to send feedback. And there's no reductionist channel and merchandising team in the middle that optimizes your products for being easy to stack or just a higher profit margin so you can compete against other products around it in the eye high shelf space in the supermarkets. Those are all influences on products that don't lead to better products. And I think this is actually at the root of a lot of the criticism about disposable consumerism that I think is being leveled. It's not because people love stuff. It's because people hate the stuff they get. We are starting some of the processes and helping getting people to have this direct relationship, which just leads to actual Allbirds, like wonderful products like this, which are clearly just built with feedback from the people who wear them and want to recommend them. I think that works better for everyone and it's what we want to see more of. Patrick: With something like this in particular, thinking back to your point about, you got to be careful about which adjacencies you get dragged into. Obviously, logistics is firmly in the vertical of core muscle movements or something, whatever you want to call it for a merchant that's selling online. They have to get their stuff to places. What lessons have you learned entering into a much more atoms-driven world in terms of what good product means? What is a good fulfillment network? I wouldn't know how to answer that question. Obviously, there's the 800 pound gorilla and Amazon that proves you can build incredible logistics networks over time. I mean, it's just a very different kind of calculus than a great new piece of software, which I don't think anyone would say Amazon builds great software. They seem to build great infrastructure. What have you learned about that? Is it radically different than what makes you good at software? Or is it a different set of skills required than what makes you good at software to be excellent at fulfillment and logistics? Tobi: Yeah, I think so. We tend to talk a lot about intuition because intuition is also one of those underestimated things. Intuition is actually all of your life knowledge channeled quickly. I always recommend people to actually actively build their intuition for kinds of problems they want to solve in their career. There's this uncanny thing. People were just incredible, effective, and so on. They can look at an architectural drawing and instantly tell you if it's good or not. And then they need to think maybe 10 minutes to figure out what the problem is. But something pinged their brain about maybe call it weak signal detection like, ""There's something wrong here.""And I think this is the way intuition can be really helpful, but you have to understand that it's task-based. Intuition built in world of bytes is not good intuition in your world of atoms. Actually, you almost want to get away from having the people who have that kind of intuition make choices. And the other thing, sometimes the bytes people end up being the most useful people in the meetings because, of course, everyone with industry experience will understand how things are. And a lot of engineers have a really good ability to think from first principles and just figure out that's what it is, but what ought it to be? How could this all work together? And then you don't just pivot to that. You figure out from now on, every step we do, everything we implement, how can we make it so that we can get closer to the ideal eventually? That's a humility that's really, really important. What does good look like? I mean, good looks like if we can put on a website that this thing will be with you tomorrow and then it does, that's good.At some point, this crunches together to SLAs. It becomes quantifiable in this way. And you're right. Another thing you can do is also look at what Amazon build. And that's also very, very good. Shopify's relationship with Amazon, the media is trying to make this very zero sum. We treat them as a very worthy rival. Sometimes you ask or say what you can learn from them? And sometimes you ask what you can do better from them. And I hope they treat us the same as well. But again, and in those circumstances, I'll be thinking about how to capture pieces of pies from our competitors, actually ever. Positive sum thinking is so valuable because it's amazing how often people are trying to compete for pieces of pies rather than just grow markets. Everything about the Shopify journey has convinced me it really doesn't pay to really have market analysis. Well known venture capitalists passed on Shopify in 2008, partly because there was only 40,000 online stores and that was not a big enough market for the investment. And I'm still disappointed with that because I realized, especially venture capitalists should not make this particular category mistake. If it's common there, it's clearly common everywhere. Patrick: I love this idea that if you bring this person into the atoms conversation, their intuition may just be wrong. In what ways is it most commonly wrong? Tobi: I mean, change management for software is deploy. Change management of people is a project that's going to take you a while. The cost to switch is significantly higher. There really is a long itinerary of things that are wrong. It's useful, but it's useful as an input, not useful as a, ""Let's do that thing."" This goes beyond engineers, of course. Even UX has been really interesting because for instance, we’re designing UX for robotics. You scan an item, it goes onto a Chuck is what the robots are called, and the Chuck does the heavy lifting of moving it around. Just let the associates do the things that they uniquely can do well, and let the robots do the stuff that they don't actually like doing. That's the way we build our robotics, but this requires a very interesting human interaction design that ought to not wind up annoying after a while. And I think that's really important. And designing interfaces that people are using every minute is different from software that people sign up once and then process some orders in every day. People that just have to recalibrate. I think that's also makes our work really fun. Patrick: You mentioned earlier this notion that maybe the factor is a 100X that were underestimating the potential impact of especially close to zero marginal cost digital infrastructure. When you've approached the Shopify network, how has it felt to be much more tied to real napkin math, return on investment math, higher CapEx? To use a crazy example, no one buys an apartment expecting it to a 100X. It's not going to happen. There's limiters that don't exist in the digital world and the physical, and therefore the math behind it all, the return on investment, and the ways it impacts the ecosystem maybe are more measurable. Do you think that's true? And how much does that figure into your decisions on how to, when to, where to build the fulfillment network? Tobi: You can attack the fulfillment network with Excel spreadsheets, and ideally you encode confidence factors into a whole lot of your numbers. I always chafe a little bit about spreadsheets lead to fake certainty, and very often the spreadsheet ends up winning the meeting. And I find that there's a lot of ways how that can go very wrong. I'm encouraging people to next to ideally to every column that has an assumption in, put your confidence in. And then instead of having a final number about what's best, I want to see the error margins. Anyway, I think partly about it like this, because it needs to make sense on this level as well. But I see the real benefit of a fulfillment network actually totally differently. I want Shopify to be magic product that can accept money in whatever way the planet earth conspires to move money around. It can do your brand justice in making you look fantastic in whatever channel you choose to be represented in. And then it will get your customers to be incredibly delighted with the experience of buying from you, by making the things show up the next day. And a magic internet site that solves all those kind of problems so that you can just really make the product.It's very hard to capture this in spreadsheets on SFN alone. I think it's actually important for the story of what Shopify is becoming, and it's exactly this infinite game thing that's being really honed in here because I want people to say that Shopify is ideal when you're starting a new retail business. It's simply the ideal software. My work is to make it so that people who, for whatever reason choose not to use Shopify, make a huge strategic mistake. I don't control people's choices. I control only our choices. We need to show up with the best thing that this particular assemblage of people can create. In the end, it's very hard to quantify the effects of something like the fulfillment network. Again, I'm comfortable with unquantifiables. We really should double click on this a bit because it is a very recurring topic. I do think that somewhere around the time VisiCalc got invented, or when we first started bringing in spreadsheets, think about that piece of infrastructure and how much value that's created in the world. I think it's a little bit of a victim of its own success because it's been so useful, especially to the world that existed when it first came around. You know the old, ""All models are wrong, but some models are useful""? That's true with spreadsheets, too. I would say that there's an unbelievable competition for everything in the world that's quantifiable, partly because people are guided into this space by spreadsheets.There's a primacy to making decisions this way. Where the Venn diagram of value you can create and value you can directly quantify is like a very small overlap. I would say it's probably 80% of a value that's there can't really be quantified because it hits you in second order effects. Even when you value companies, how do you value a company like Shopify? Obviously people are, but the best thing we have ever figured out to do is create a market and observe buying and selling patterns. Although, as we all know, there's a huge multiplier on confidence in the future encoded in this so that this can swing significantly while the company actually it's fair market value is clearly only increasing because it's launching awesome stuff. So it's a zig-zag somewhere that has the actual real market value, presumably somewhere in the space traversed, but it doesn't spend a whole lot of time in it, I think, or closer. I think that we just have to be comfortable with things like taste, for things like intuition, with things like that's awesome. If you do something and say, ""That's awesome,"" I don't know how to put that into the spreadsheet. But I can tell you it's going to be reflected in the numbers if a lot of people agree with it. I don't think Shopify can succeed in the long term if you're not comfortable with building things purely for the unquantifiable with some semblance of faith in the second and third order effects being good for the spreadsheets. Patrick: One of the most interesting parts of our discussion last time was this obvious tension that I think you've lived with and held. And obviously, we talked a lot this time and last time about wonderful product. And then obviously, the other side of every business is distribution. And really, I think the Shopify merchant's responsibility as you described it last time was create a great product and sell it. Get people that it would be appropriate for to know it exists and to want be interested in it and buy it. And then everything else, we'll do for you. I really enjoyed that discussion about as Shopify becomes more ubiquitous and used by more and more merchants, how do you make sure you're not the aggregator that sits on top and you're the brand in the background? And then I'll go back to the infinite games, Horizon. One of the things that popped on the Horizon was the IDFA change, which materially impacts the way that Shopify merchants are trying to reach and sell their product to their customers. Has your view evolved or changed on this at all? Shopify's role in the potential for distribution for its merchant partners and even a centralized role that it could play? The Shop app came out after our first conversation. How has your view changed at all through COVID on this idea of distribution and whether or not you should play a role? Tobi: My view has been, if you do it, we have to be very careful about it. And I think that has not changed. It's a complex topic. TheATT changes are interesting. And what may really highlight is just things on the internet are fleeting. And I advertised my snowboards in 2004. I was the only person bidding on the keywords for all the ski resorts. That's also a very different internet. Things change, opportunities arise, and some opportunities are closed. The ATT changes specifically. I mean, they captured everyone's imagination. I don't actually think they're even amongst the largest changes that have happened. They are unfortunate changes, partly because I think small businesses ended up in a crosshair and potentially in a friendly fire of something unrelated. They're not a huge change. It's something like five to 10%, maybe. The one thing about them, and this is why I really particularly dislike them is because it's not an even distribution across everyone. If you have a pretty mass market product, you’re probably not affected at all. It's very regressive. The people who are most affected are the people making the products at the intersection of three different things. The electric skateboards for people who like technology and skateboarding. Some of the products that are doing really well in Shopify are intersections three layers across, finding the set of 1,000 true fans that really need something like that. That specific thing has gotten harder, which unfortunately, also is usually the smallest of the merchants. Other ones are just starting because a lot of the white space is in finding your unique niche. In a way I think ATT changes caused some very regrettable situation where it's fine for people who are already big, but devastating or at least 30% impacting, which sometimes is entire margin for the people who ought to build businesses. And we would like to see succeed.To a certain degree, probably discovery is being dragged out of us in Shop, is something that clearly we users of Shop really want from us. I think doing a really good job, coming up with new ideas, new shopping surfaces, which are non rivalrous between all the merchants to a degree that's possible. But that's really early. The Shopify audiences product, which can help a little bit with finding these more niche audiences. Now, that's a very early product, which is currently aimed at plus merchants. There's an ambition to bring this further because we really care about getting people through the starting period. But there's also some opportunities for helping people with their first sales. My ideal situation here would be, help as much as we can, get past the cold start problem, and then potentially as they get larger, help them figure out their broader marketing approaches through data analysis, potentially models, potentially audience creation based on your own data. But this is all very early, very influx. I would say though, that new opportunities for advertising keep coming around, like connected TV is becoming more of a thing. And radio ads actually turn out to be underutilized now, because a lot of money has shifted into other channels. And then new attention platforms are coming along all the time. I think the important thing for us is, we want to help people be able to take advantage of what other people have built. And as much as we can do something ourselves, that's also good, but I don't think it's utterly necessary for the success. Patrick: I have a friend that jokes, on long enough timeline, any big enough business sells ads. And it's a funny conception, but it's just funny how many times it serves to be true. It sounds like in this case, what you're saying is, there's going to be a lot of places where you can get the attention of the customer and you have to be creative and you have to adapt. The keyword, start getting higher, et cetera. But that this is maybe a good example of Shopify not getting dragged into an adjacency. Do what you can to support it. But ultimately it is the responsibility of the merchant to know how this works, and evolve and adapt. Tobi: Finding product market fit is square in the center of a particular vertical slice that we want to help people. I really like Kevin Kelly's 1000 true fans essay. Finding your first 1000 true fans is just an objective in the beginning. I think the internet should conspire to make that possible for people. And we will work hard on trying to make it easier as well, especially because lately, as you see, it's becoming harder.",5009
116,Tobi Lutke - Embrace the Unexpected,Managing the Business Through Market Volatility," Patrick: You said something earlier about the fair market value of the company, probably being, maybe there's some jaggedness to it, but it's a fairly steady line. And then I was thinking about this analogy of a guy walking through central park from corner to corner at a 45 degree angle. And that fair market value is sort of the guy walking, and he is walking his dog on a long leash, and the dog is running on either side of the fair market value. Sometimes that's what the stock market looks like or the price for a given stock. What has it been like managing through a very, at first upside volatile and then downside volatile stock price, knowing from our first conversations and other times we've talked that this is obviously not something that you or you want the employees to be focused on. But nonetheless, is an input into the business, if you need capital or want to sell shares or buy shares or whatever. What lessons have you learned managing this where, maybe the best performing stock added the most market cap of any company. And then there's been growth, multiple contraction on the other side in 2022. Tell me everything you can about what you've learned managing through this and what you've found to be important? Tobi: I think the really important thing is, what's the relationship between a company and the stock? And we talk about this internally and I think that's serving us really well. We are not our stock. Our stock is a marker. People forget this, but the stock price is set by someone making a sell decision and someone making a buy decision. People coming to an agreement at this particular number, and that goes into the tickers. We’re not in offices anymore, but all our offices are connected to an electricity grid. I don't think you can really predict how well the company is doing based on how much energy it's consuming. It's related to what's being done, but it doesn't represent some kind of incredible wisdom of a company. Shopify has huge potential. I think that's quite clear to the people who observe the company, it plays a super important role to its customers. And it's just a good deal. I think it's a very focused company, that's building great product, in a space that's super valuable, all these kind of things. So you see this and what you do I think is, you do an internal check about like, ""Hey, how optimistic am I about the future?"" Then you take whatever you see with the company and you multiply it with that thing. And then the end result is going to be something that you're willing to engage in a trade with. Now, if the world changes a lot and everyone's optimistic-ness is canceled for the time being, then suddenly you're multiplying with a very, very, very low number, and then you just trade at that. Shopify has the pleasure and displeasure of being a large modifier very affected by people's read about future and markets and economies. So I think that's been interesting. Friends have encouraged me to sometimes share some of these things that we have discussed internally on Twitter. And then now plenty of IR people are encouraging me to stop doing that as well. So it's certainly on both sides of this.I think things get really bad when people are making decisions based on the stock. Outside of, for their personal portfolio buying or selling, that's your decision that you can make with a stock because that's the one thing it's authoritative over. I want Shopify to be like a really, really high quality winning sports team. Some people describe a company as family. I just don't find that to be a really good analogy. I like professional sports team better. Does anyone believe that the team members in a sports team check the betting markets before the game? Maybe they do. But when you are in front of a goal as a striker, you should think about, can you score? Not, what's the betting market say? And then change your decision based on this. This is the tweet I made. And then people said, ""Well, what about stock based compensation?"" I was talking about decision making. I also get that part, and that causes some conversations inside of companies, for sure. I think all of these acute micro challenges like this can be handled during a downturn. Again, back to intuition. I think in good times, everyone's intuition are largely proxies to what companies ought to be doing. Probably 80% of the random unsolicited feedback you get is actually something you should take very seriously. I think during downturns - a reason why I think a lot of companies end up washing out doing downturns is because, during the good times, especially 13 years of good times, you end up in a pattern that you just end up caring or even prioritizing what other people think. And you are running the company on a say so of some kind of group consensus.I think in downturns, you really have to have a vision that you're following. Frankly, your moves are not going to be intuitively the right moves. You really need those asbestos pants in those times to deal with this. I think a lot of companies aren’t willing to do this. So tying this all back to the stock. I spend super little time thinking about this. Again, I work all day on fair market value of business. Other people buy and sell. That's eventually convergent again on whatever the fair market value might be. And that's how I think about it. That's how I teach it to people inside of a company. And that's the entire thing. Now, sure, you have some moves you can do, especially if you want to use stock for M&A during good times. But frankly, if you raised cash during previous times and now you can deploy it, then you're in very good shape. But prudent money management, I think, involves raising money for rainy days, which I think most companies have executed really well this cycle, which is also different from times past, I think. Patrick: It's fascinating to think about, it seems to be in the cross hairs again for people, the relationship between capital markets and companies, where for a long period of time, especially in technology, capital was sort of like a faucet that you turned on and off. And maybe we're going through a protracted downturn here, and that will be different again. How much do you think about the capital allocation piece of Shopify as it grows? Things like share issuance, share buybacks, maybe would be the question today as the multiples come way down. You already addressed M&A and the potential for arbitrage there. This is a very different thing than focusing on product driven, fair market value. But how much do you think about some of those bigger capital allocation decisions and the ways that it might impact everything that matters to you at Shopify? Tobi: Capital allocation is the name of the entire game. Finding a team that's working on something is a huge expense. At some point, show me your roadmap and I will show you your actual strategy. Obviously, the deep financial ones, share buybacks and capital raises, are the top of the iceberg of capital allocation work, which are observable by everyone from great distance. I think people who have built good companies with good unit economics are good capital allocators at the end of the day. Different tools come out during different times, and we will use every tool that's available. Shopify's not immune to the sunk cost fallacy, but I think it's better than most companies. We don't really have sacred cows in these ways. If something makes sense, it makes sense. I personally bought some Shopify shares. Could think about a share buy-back for Shopify but there's a lot of things going on that make that hard. So it's probably not the best use of Shopify's capital, but as an outsider during an open trading window, that seems like really good investment.Shopify was profitable as a private company, then it was profitable again as a venture backed company. It has been profitable for times as a public company. I'm a card carrying member of a club of people who says that companies ought to make money at some point. I do find it's important that people look at the unit economics independently, because if they're really good and a company invests of course a lot, then that's a very different thing. I'm not saying anything crazy, because there's been lots of fantastic companies that can be observed with this lens. I think everyone's fine with this. The way you do anything is how you do everything. If you're on a journey, you have to be good at being on this journey. And being good on the segment of a journey is different from good times, compared to tough times. I would like my work to be judged based on, ""Did I do the right thing from a long term perspective, given the macro situation? The water Shopify was swimming in at the time, that's the way I think about it. Patrick: Do you have any advice for company leaders that are trying to communicate with their teams, especially around something like stock based compensation, where people are people? They see their shares, they look at the price, they do the math. And stock based compensation can be a very big part of compensation for the technology sector. Is there anything you've done for your team or with your team that you've found to be extra effective at just level setting around this topic that you think other leaders could productively adopt? Tobi: Presumably, the leaders are going to be on the same side of the table as the rest of the team. So I think actually, just saying that is really, really good. It's like, ""Hey, this sucks for everyone."" There's three things that make us all use this tax based compensation in terms of long term alignment and so on. It's very hard to improve on as a facility, but it has this massive downside of everyone freezing the current level of ambient market optimism into a number that's really relevant for everyone after a certain point. We would never, ever design a system from scratch like this. It's a fairly dumb system. But the upsides are of course spectacular, because it really can swing both ways. But the downside is also obvious. We are thinking about how would you actually do compensation from scratch if you would design it today and see if you can get in that direction? Just because, if it weren't for the stock based compensation strike price setting, then there would not be a real relation between the stock price, outside of when people sell shares and buy shares when it matters. Or when a company wants to sell shares, then it matters. But I think there's a benefit of reducing the day to day impact of the stock price onto the company as much as possible. And I think we'll see more new and clever compensation systems again, that are going to try to just go for different sets of trade offs, try to reproduce some of the things that we got through stock based conversation and other means. I think that's worthwhile thinking about. Will not solve the immediate issue though. Outside of that, I don't have good advice. The best time to talk about these things was half a year ago. We were lucky to just tell everyone. When the stock was up 20%, we did not get 20% smarter. So if it goes down 40% tomorrow, we also didn't get 40% dumber. This is all philosophically points at a very particular spot that's very right. I think we might have even talked about this last time.It's like the Alfred Adler idea of separation of tasks. And I find that's an incredibly applicable concept. Basically, in a nutshell is, what do you control? And then he talks you into actually, you don't control anything other than the content of your brain, really, which is a very stoic idea, but also clearly right. He talks a lot about interpersonal conflict. Someone says, ""This person doesn't like me and I feel bad about myself because of that."" He retorts that, your job is to be a likable person. And if that person doesn't like you, then they control that and that's nothing to do with you. It's how to live this. It's clearly correct. And frankly, it might just simply be the best idea in the world. At least a candidate for that. I really find that broadly applicable. What's my job? My job is fundamentally to fill my brain with a set of intuitions that are going to be really, really good in the moment for Shopify. Being able to make flexible decisions, being able to know enough and have enough depth about all the things that Shopify works on that I can at least counter check people's assumptions based on first principle thinking, that's important to me. The goal of the company is just, be the best company you can. Work on the fair market value. You're not the stock. The stock is a voting mechanism on how much we succeed over time, with all sorts of other confounding variables in it. To me, that's extraordinarily liberating to think about the world in this way. It guides me in all sorts of places. I want to be the best dad I can. The relationship for my children is an emergent fact based on that, how is this working? One of my sons is going to be one of those which really has to reach for independence, and everything dad is doing is uncool, which I'm sure I'm going to get into this phase soon. That is regrettable, but not something I'm going to try to micromanage away, because that's where things go really bad.I find that really useful when thinking about stock. I find that really useful when talking about compensation. I think again, compensation specifically is the base salary, sure. It's a stock based compensation, which of course is a bummer to everyone there right now. But also, your lifetime earnings is the thing that you should optimize for. Forget your stock based compensation. Forget your salary. It's about the skills you acquire. Most people will listening will work in industries that are very meritocratic, or at least have very good performance management. Tech and finance and so on. And the world will conspire to get you to the place where you have the most marginal value. Otherwise, you should find another place to work for. The trick, if you want to make money is, learn the most, become better at your skills. It's hard to imagine something better to pick up and learn about than the behavior of companies in times of, the purse strings are a bit tighter and ambient optimism is a bit lower. I think people can rise to vocation. And I think companies will wind up being a lot more focused. More and more of their adjacencies are going to fall to the wayside because at the end of the day, we make goods and services that are usually delightful to our customers. And that's kind of the entire thing we're doing as companies. Figuring out how to be of as much value for that and be the person who has conviction or knows what to do next. Then other people are looking around to figure out, who is emerging as a leader? Those are the things that will have much bigger impact than these underwater grants that you might be fretting about. At least try to balance the attention units that you have in your brain between both of those parts of your compensation. And optimize, when you're part of a company, always for working at a place where you can grow the most and where you can learn the most. That's honestly the true key to lifetime earnings.",3310
117,Tobi Lutke - Embrace the Unexpected,Future Direction & Blockchain's Potential," Patrick: That's interesting how that fair market value concept can be zoomed down to the individual. And it boils down to learning, fueled by curiosity is a really cool concept. I would also sum up what you said about all of this as, capital markets at their best form for a company represent opportunity. They should not be fully relied upon. If you're in that game of full reliance on capital markets, you're subject to the whims of things you don't control. And unit profitability and being profitable through the journey and controlling that destiny is really critical and a really cool takeaway. If you think about now where this all goes from here, I love the Buffet quote. I almost never quote Buffet, but this is a particularly good one. ""Every storm runs out of rain."" I just think that's so true. This storm will run of rain too. And the other side of this is going to be, we know the trend lines. We've seen the e-commerce penetration trendline. We've seen the digital penetration trend lines, which are inexorable. Where does that take us? How much do you think COVID altered that trajectory? Obviously, for a period of time, it drastically inflected the adoption curves, and it seems like we're leveling off or even returning to the prior curves. How do you think about all of that and where we're going? This is kind of hearkening back to where we started, which is digital infrastructure as a concept. What's exciting to you, to close on an optimistic and forward looking note? What has your deepest interest or curiosity right now, as you navigate towards that horizon? Tobi: We've been trying to solve very complex technical problems for a long time. And the quality of solutions coming right now is just better than I think a lot of what we’ve seen in the past. And there's this other effect that we alluded to earlier, which is that, enough people are either at end of their careers now, and actually take the time to write books about what they learned. And I think we're such a young industry that we just didn't have that good source material, or at least things that we can immerse ourselves in the thoughts and lessons learned of some other individual. And then pick and choose the ones which we think will be relevant for the long term. You can do this in every space, and in tech you couldn't. There's just not that much important things written yet. And that's really changing, there's lots of lessons learned now and that's really good. And so COVID leaped forward. In terms of GDP numbers in terms of usage, these are these sort of vectors that we use to figure out which direction things are going. Things have jumped forward, like upwards and then meandered back to basically the trend line in every chart I've ever seen. I see some of them have a trend line, and it's not the trend line. People engage in a little bit of motivated reasoning with graphs at times, and things are tracking ahead. And that makes sense, because we now are living on a planet where I think everyone has a functioning understanding about how to communicate remotely, utilize the internet, involve it in their lives, with their families, with their companies, with their churches or whatever. That is going to lead to a different outcome. Innovation is very path dependent, and it'll be a very different world because of this. Maybe not in exactly the ways we thought. For some time we thought, maybe this is just a 10 year leap ahead, then there would be no convergence. There would just be a step function and then a dent in the chart. Maybe this is true in some places, it's not true universally.Again, that's fine, because people consume whatever they want to consume. And the wonderful thing is, now, no one's forced to be inside anymore, under a shelter in place, no matter what you think about these kind of policies. So people have personal agency again, and we'll see what they do. But one thing we will not have to deal with anymore is ignorance about the digital realm. So that's a massive opportunity space again, and I'm super encouraged about cultural trends within engineering, because everything is getting a lot more pragmatic again. Things have gotten very theoretical, and people fell in love a little bit with the tools rather than the output of the tools, which can happen during good times. There's always a bit of a back to basics that happens when times get a little bit tougher. You will end up doing nothing after a while, if you don't get these times every once in a while, so that's encouraging. And it was already going on before it happened, but it accelerated, which is especially important because planet earth is going to be limited by the lack of engineers. We don't have enough for all the digital problems we have to solve.So engineering efficiency is going to be the second best thing there. Lots of advances in UX. I think the product discipline is sort of coming into its own and has stronger self confidence. No one's surprised by the unreasonable power of data either. So I think these four disciplines make the R&D realm, and the R&D realm is going to be the one which dictates innovation. I would say, it's as healthy as I've ever seen it as a discipline. And that's, I think really, really exciting, because it will lead to fantastic products that people will be extremely excited about, inside of companies like Shopify and others as well. Patrick: I realized that I have an opportunity to ask you about your interaction with this notion of block chains and ownership in the digital sense, at a time when it's a bit out of favor. We're talking on the 17th of May in 2022, and we've just been through some very prolific blowups with something like Luna. There's definitely a flush out, I'll call it that's happening, a forest fire of sorts that's happening in that world. But you said earlier, something really interesting, which is, people like to own stuff. And we don't have that hourglass choke point for pure ownership in the digital sense. What have you learned about this area that's interesting to you, especially as it seems like it's being tested right now? What intrigues you? What might this unlock? How should other people think about it? Because I know you've spent time on it. Tobi: I'm very excited about this. I'm not a fan of a lot of things that are going on, on it. I think you're right, the Luna thing is just nuts. You invoked the concept of a forest fire. Good forestry management involves actually letting fires go through, so that the fuel on the ground doesn't build up and make something that ends up being fully out of control. I was hoping something more measured would go through, but it was quite clear that something had to go through. My excitement about crypto is really from an enablement perspective. Again, the zero marginal cost copying of everything is the world we all live in. It's a totally intuitive, obvious concept to me, but everything can be infinitely copied. In fact, even using a website is actually copying images from a server into your main memory. Again, I think about things very much from an enablement and infrastructure perspective. And the blockchain and specifically smart contracts, which I think are even more meaningful than a blockchain are just really creating things that we couldn't do.We were limited to building basically the things that could be built with abundance. So that was a really, really good first step. But you want the internet to be able to implement complex systems that involve ownership. Trust is a very human concept, and figuring out how to port trust is very, very tricky. And in fact, if you ever see the charts of trust in institutions, it's trending very much the wrong way. We may actually lose certain institutions over this decade from the ability to engage with citizens in a way where everyone's really fully trusting each other. Math is very good as a way to model trust. I think the internet has gotten some new skills, new comments, new infrastructure. We will be able to build very, very cool things with that. You see this in the arts right now, like NFTs. It's easy to level criticism there, but I've also had dinner with people who have very memorably dedicated entire lives to a particular, very nichey sub-part of art, wrote essays about it and so on, and it just ended up being one of those types of arts that just was really compatible with the ideas of NFTs and blockchains. The world went up and ended up capturing everyone's imagination and has one of the most many times traded 5% split amongst artists and initial publisher.But if the only thing we end up here is an actual business model for the arts, there's a lot of people who think that humanity, being human, is actually defined by arts. I'm not sure I would take that position, but I think the fact that it's in the running means we actually should take it seriously. And this is the first time the arts have gotten a new business model since patronage. That's pretty notable. Usually when something has unlocked something new that's possible, it's not going to be useful for only just one single use case. Now that all being said, they've got to figure out how to get some of the frothiness out of this. More and more people are learning that some institutions are very good institutions and really ought to exist and ought to have some leverage, and how this all can be reconciled, I don't know. There's a small part that Shopify can play around, because we love the idea of communities. A lot of good Shopify stores end up striking up communities. NFTs are very good club membership attestation. So products that are available to people or potentially infinitely reorderable to people after their title is managed by something you have in a wallet is just a very cool way to think about bootstrapping new communities. So there's lots of things we can support there and support merchants with.I have a lot of friends who make a good deal of money. Not everyone stayed in the arena. Me and some of my colleagues did. A lot of people made a good deal of money and followed the siren call of sipping mojitos on a beach, and I always thought this was really regrettable. I love when people build. Again, I love entrepreneurship. I think that comes through in these conversations. I see a lot of them come back, just because something that actually is probably not much right now, but it will unlock completely new potential in somewhat similar way how the '90s internet did. I think this is what a lot of us are reminded of, because the '90s internet, you went to a university to get your first terminal, Netscape web browser experience. There wasn't a useful website to go to. I remember the default at my local university was basically Yahoo. There was one website that's called The Big Red Button That Does Nothing, which you could push. So unfortunately I think a lot of crypto is like big red button that doesn't do a lot. That is not a statement about the future potential of the entire space, far from it. So this is what I personally like about it. Patrick: Well, since I've already had you on and asked my normal closing question, I thought I'd come up with a new one for this time. Is there an idea that you've encountered recently that you've fallen in love with, that's relatively new to you? It could be from a book. It could be from any source. You strike me as someone that collects interesting and useful ideas, tries them on for size, keeps some, jettisons other. What have you encountered that is something that you're playing with right now that's potentially interesting or useful, that's a new idea? Tobi: I do love digging into ideas and handling them. Obviously I spend a good deal of time trying to figure out my thoughts on infrastructure. We did talk at length about it, so I don't want to go more into it. But the return on investment of the Apollo program is probably like $5 trillion. It's just nuts how much. And I'm so sad that we’re not doing these things anymore, but I understand why, but I understand how to fix it. But like again, if we can at least keep doing it in the digital realm, then things are good. I mean, the thing I just find is culture. It's like we had a really cool thing going, which I'm missing now, where everyone works digitally. We really succeeded with company internal multiculturalism, where our Shopify Plus team was in a different office and had a cohesive culture which was fantastic for this kind of thing. Even the engineers that were part of Plus ended up staying late at the end of quarters, and they had a gong there, and they shipped at the end of quarter. No one at Shopify has ever considered doing this, we ship when something is done.I guess what multiculturalism to me means is tolerance and appreciation of other cultures, but ability to maintain difference as well. Because I think if you end up meeting exactly in the middle, you have a very undifferentiated culture. Sometimes the spectrum of things that people are allowed to talk about gets very limited even in these environments. So we're trying to figure out how to do this in digital. That's something I'm figuring out. When you analyze really good companies. I think they have succeeded in being able to have different parts of a company work on different pace, different north stars, different pursuits, different culture, different norms, instead of driving towards a global cohesion level. And I think, to me, that's notable. Patrick: It's a wonderful thing. I mean, it feels like the whole world's trying to figure this out. Like, what is the right mix of separation, decentralization, in-person, digital? It's like there's no good answer to it, but everyone's yearning for something different than generic, all-digital, Zoom-filled days. And it's important to solve. Well, Tobi, this is, as always, just incredibly fun. So many interesting topics to cover. I think for me, the takeaway is this notion of working on something well defined, taking it very seriously, and understanding this principle of the horizon, that you should love the unexpected changes that come at you, because all that's doing is giving you more opportunity to learn, versus living a rigid rule system that becomes very difficult when there's chaos, like what we've seen in the last couple of years. So I really appreciate your time. I always learn so much from you. Thank you so much. Tobi: Yeah. Thanks for having me. This was great fun.This site uses cookies to improve your browsing experience.

118,"Daniel Gross, Tyler Cowen - Identifying Talent",Introduction," Patrick: Our guests today are Tyler Cowen and Daniel Gross. Tyler is an economics professor and creator of one of the most popular economics blogs on the internet. Daniel is the founder of startup accelerator Pioneer, having previously been a director at Apple and a partner at Y Combinator. Both Daniel and Tyler are prolific talent spotters. And that is the focus of our discussion and their new book, which is called Talent. Please enjoy this conversation with Tyler Cowen and Daniel Gross.",108
119,"Daniel Gross, Tyler Cowen - Identifying Talent",Understanding All Aspects of Talent," Patrick: Tyler and Daniel, I just a few days ago finished your fantastic new book on talent. I think it's a topic that everyone is implicitly interested in and is incredibly important in the modern world. And I think we have to begin our conversation since we'll go into lots of facets of this topic with some basic ground leveling definitions. So I'd love for each of you, maybe Tyler starting with you, to just give what your definition is of talent, having now investigated this topic so much so that you're able to write a book about it. Tyler: We treat talent as having a creative energy that can alter outcomes and make projects better in ways that matter. Patrick: Daniel, would you define it any way different? Daniel: I think it's very related. And thank you of course, for having us on, we're honored to be here. I think it is the ability ultimately to positively manipulate whatever current environment you're in to achieve your desired outcome. There's many different ways of doing that. Some people do that by intellect. Some people do that by charisma. Some people do that by physical strength, but that is ultimately I think the basic definition of talent. Patrick: How do you think about the difference between means and ends when it comes to talent specifically, if both of you mentioned something kind of around the ability to shift the environment in which you're in or affect some end, some goal, some outcomes, some achievement, maybe others are just really good at doing something, they're talented at something without a goal in mind, what did you learn or think about means versus ends when assessing talent? Tyler: I look for people who really value the means. So if someone says to you, ""I want to be the best drummer of all time."" Well, that's definitely better than no ambition at all, but I actually want to hear someone saying, ""I love to drum."" And that's the person who's more likely to become the best drummer of all time. Patrick: Daniel, I'm curious what you think about this idea of Diet Coke. I asked for strange theories or little things that you discovered as ideas. What is this Diet Coke idea and why is that relevant? Daniel: I was just saying, I think it's interesting and abstract that you have Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Florence Summers, John Carmack, all these different titans of industry across very different spectrums, who all have at some point in their life, and some of them, even to this day, seem to be guzzling Diet Coke. If I told you in abstract, there was a secret black potion that no one knew the recipe of that was made in Mississippi that titans of industries seem to drink, you'd say, ""Well, maybe I should drink that too."" Now, I know everyone's dietician told them, ""Don't have Diet Coke, it has aspartame and whatnot and it's extremely chemical."" But I don't know. It seems to be working really well for these people. Well, you might say, ""The rest of the country also drinks Diet Coke too."" So I'm not sure how valuable that is as a metric. The more important, interesting thing we were talking about before that the Diet Coke idea is getting at, is just raw potential energy. You come into our book and this podcast, and more broadly, wondering how to assess talent, what to look for in people, how to get better at that? There's all sorts of frameworks one can throw at with all sorts of fancy words and acronyms, Myers-Briggs MBTI, the Big Five Aspect Scale. And those are important. We can maybe talk about those if we want.But the real thing to look for is raw potential energy that someone has. There's something I find interesting about vigorousness and vitality of people that seem to be consuming all sorts of chemicals, compounds, whatnot, and seem to be fine regardless, versus someone that's very careful and specific about what they do, don't want to have caffeine before bed, whatnot. On the flip side, you meet the top salespeople at a certain company and whatnot, and they're just pushing forward. They're having a double espresso after dinner. And I find that sign of physical health and stamina to be something to look for that I think people don't focus on that much, because it's not that intellectually clever or acute, but I think it's just a very basic thing. A few recruiters I work with, first thing I ask people to do, they bring me a long list of candidates and they're going to have to go through all sorts of the different signaling mechanisms you get, like who went to what school and whatnot and who has a better GitHub profile. I just ask some of your top three people just by energy, who is the most energetic person to talk to? And I think if we take our previous definition of talent and reapply it here, someone who just has energy to try many different ways to positively manipulate the universe, to do their bidding is just going to have more shots on goal. Patrick: I was going to ask you to quantify or discuss the nuance around energy because there's ram down the wall energy, there's subtle ever-present energy. Tyler, in your mind, what type of energy is valuable as you think about talent? Tyler: People who always want to get to the next destination and achieve something. And they're very focused on that. And one reason why I tend to agree with Daniel on the Diet Coke question, Diet Coke is something you can almost always get a hold of in the Western world. So if that's your fixation for your nervous energy, you're not going to be frustrated that often, you can always get a Diet Coke. So at some mix of extreme habit formation, a kind of impulse within yourself, plus caffeine, is how to model that. And if you think, well, how many substances fit all of those three markers, actually Diet Coke probably would seem to win. When I used to play chess when I was much younger, the thing I would look at is how does the person pick up the chess pieces? Do they seem energetic in their moves? Do they seem focused? Do they seem like they give a damn? In most areas that are quite nonphysical, you can find physical parallels that you can look at to get a sense of energy, attentiveness and focus. Even the non-physical world is intensely physical as I understand it. Patrick: I think it's obvious why talent's an important topic because especially in the symbol manipulation world that we live in the world of business today, talent is outcomes in most companies, especially modern technology companies. So I think it's obvious why we would want to search for talent. My hesitance to go straight into the quantitative is important because I come from a quantitative background. I try to jam everything through this lens, but I'm curious what you think about this sort of Moneyball-like approach to talent. Having investigated, Daniel, you listed off some of the famous personality inventories. Can this be quantified? What is your view here? Are there useful tools for us to say quantitatively, this person's more talented than this person, or do we really need to stick in the qualitative realm? Daniel: I would say three things. First, I think the field of social sciences has a lot to be discovered. I really think we are probably at day one. Our understanding today using the frameworks that people talk about in research and literature, as far as I can tell, and Tyler will know much more about this, will add some color in a moment, but we're really staring at 1920s film. This is not 4K Marvel cinematic universe stuff. This is like really low, low resolution stuff. In fact, we're trying to take an incredibly high resolution image, which is someone's personality and predicting how that actor will work in different environments through a very, very, very narrow constraining lofty compression filter called the Big Five Aspect Scale. So it really does not capture a lot. It is what we have. And I know that the statisticians will come in and say, ""Well, we have all these surveys that show that there are big five personality traits and they don't correlate,"" but I really tend to not believe that. So I would say one, the tools that we have are incredibly course, you can kind of get a sense at the end of the day, that it's much more subtle because if you look at what machine learning does in other fields, like say with TikTok, you realize there's more than five graphs on TikTok. So there are more than five different macro personality types. And that's just a bad way of thinking about things. Second thing I'd say is outcomes, measuring people by the outcome in the previous work they did because our tools are so course, I think is a far better way to do it. So the field of software engineering, where I have the most experience, just looking at the code someone's written is going to be far more predictive, I think of any type of IQ test or psychometric tests are going to give them. And the really nice thing in the software world by the way, is a lot of the code happens out there in the open.You can actually figure out who the best software engineers are in the world in open source quantitatively, actually, just looking by their code. So I'd say if there was an interesting quantitative thing to look at, it would actually be the proof of work. Now, not everything works this way. Obviously if you're a physicist at Stanford, it's not the same as looking at your C++ code, but assessing the prior body of work, I think is far richer a thing to look at in a pinon than the results on a test. And the last thing, the final thing I'd say is fundamental constraint, I think of all personality tests, not IQ tests is that they're all self-report at the end of the day. These are people assessing their own personality. Obviously you have gaming issues where someone's assessing the personality they want to be as opposed to where they are. You have also people just repeating the same test throughout the day, delivering you completely different results. So I think that field is interesting. And I know I said three points, but maybe one final fourth point, I think they are probably helpful in the way that they provide vocabulary for a team. It might be true that you never want to use psychometrics really to measure anyone in your team or forget who to interview. But it's probably also helpful to have everyone on the team understand when you say openness, exactly what you mean. When you say conscientiousness, exactly what you mean. They provide a language and that is quite powerful. I think language was probably the original technology of our species in scare quotes. Tyler, I don't know if you have any related color to add on that or maybe disagree entirely. Tyler: I would follow up on the Moneyball example. I'm a big believer in the best metrics, and sports has a lot of the very best metrics, but the problem is other people learn them. So Moneyball only worked for a few years or in the NBA for a while, three-point shots were underrated. That hasn't been the case now for decades. So you need to learn those things that your competitors aren't learning. And over time, those become more like a form of appreciation, almost like art or music appreciation. In the NBA, the frontier question is which of these tremendous athletes is actually going to be a knucklehead and which will be a team player? And that's what you want to learn because you've measured everything possible, you have all the tape. So if you just stick with metrics, you will end up behind your sector, because those are easier for people to copy.",2575
120,"Daniel Gross, Tyler Cowen - Identifying Talent",Pricing Talent Effectively," Patrick: I'd love you to riff Tyler on the pricing of talent, if you think about it as a market, as you said in the NBA, the whole idea here was to get talent for cheaper than what should be its market price. And there's an arms race there just like in quantitative investing in public markets, signals have a half life generally speaking with maybe some exceptions, but in general, the signals have a half life. So how do you think about the market for talent? And if that is the goal, to be able to hire people at the best price or at the right price, how this should sit inside of a company, if a company is mostly going to be driven and thrive or die based on its talent, how should a company think about the pricing of talent specifically? Tyler: In the talent literature, there's often a big confusion between what is good in absolute terms? Smarts, work ethic, conscientiousness, of course, and what is undervalued in the marketplace? And if you simply pursue those things that sound good, like smarts and conscientiousness, unless you have a comparative advantage at getting the smartest people to work for you. So maybe Harvard has that comparative advantage, but most of the rest of us do not. So you have to look for the differential factors that you can either spot better or recruit better. And those again, tend to be more subjective. So does the question, how readily can a person figure out his or her role on a team? Much harder to measure than smarts or conscientiousness, it's an area where you might retain some kind of enduring comparative advantage. So not to confuse absolute importance with what's underrated. Patrick: What do you think is most overpriced as a dimension of talent in today's labor marketplace? Tyler: Depends on the job. For lower level jobs, everyone's looking for conscientiousness. It obviously is important, but if you're trying to hire away conscientious people from other organizations, the organization knows they're conscientious. They want to keep the good ones. They let the lemons come to you. So I would just say, be very careful when chasing after conscientiousness for its own sake, yet without at all denying its absolute importance. Daniel, what would you say? Daniel: One thing I've observed in both founders that I've had the honor and pleasure of working with as well as just hiring people on my team is that if you have consensus mechanism for hiring talent, you end up optimizing for very even keeled people. The most important thing to pay attention to, the most kind of mispriced people, so to speak, are ones where people on the team vehemently love them and vehemently hate them because you often get outliers in more than one dimension. You'll have people that are your typical example, like incredibly productive, but difficult to deal with. People that are incredibly extroverted and fun to deal with, but very, very bad at dotting the i's and crossing the t's. Consensus mechanisms don't end up hiring those people because it's a bit painful to push through, but I think those are the most important people. The best way I think to go about that is to have an organization where you can structure it such that the von Neumann is only doing math and it is not doing any HR.Really, really focusing on specialization is good. And that really broadens your lens. Because you can now start to think of who can I hire that somewhat actually disfigured in some ways and just have them focus on one specific thing. When you find those people and you can get them out of the general big organization that they're in, if they're stuck there, it's usually a great blessing for them too. Your prototypical example is the engineer that's really, really good, but stuck in the cogs of a large company and you just let them go at a five-person team and they cut through red tape and it's really amazing. Those people often again, when that company grows, they don't work anymore, because there's too much interfacing with other people and they need to find the next small team. Just searching for unevenness, I think is really helpful. And people don't do that. Tyler: I feel much better about a hire when I know what's wrong with the person. Daniel: Exactly. Tyler: And part of the paradox, the people ringing me the hire just want to sell me on the person and that's the wrong attitude. I try to beat that out of them a bit. I'm like, ""Well, tell me why they're a good match for us. How are they screwed up? How are they uneven?"" And then possibly, the mental picture can click. Once hired someone who on paper was perfect and the interview was perfect. He showed up, really just did no work, period, did nothing, had no ambition really, had multiple advanced degrees from prestige schools. It was a mistake. And ex-ante I couldn't answer the question, what's wrong with this person? Why does he or she want to work with us?",1125
121,"Daniel Gross, Tyler Cowen - Identifying Talent",The Relationship Between Age and Talent," Patrick: What do you think the relationship is between experience and/or age and talent? Tyler: It's going to depend on the sector. So if it's chess players, you can be washed up at 35 or 40, but if it's novelists or philosophers or in fact, people hiring talent, you tend to get better at that with age up until some extreme point. So a lot of the advice we give it's highly context specific. You might just want boring semi-low energy people if your product, say is life insurance. Can't take too much risk. You're highly regulated. Maybe you have some kind of favorite market position just to keep the ship moving in essence. So it's going to depend. Patrick: If you think about talent back to that absolute versus relative, so you could be talented at a small mid-level job, but I think the talent that we're all interested in is people that are going to make some sort of strange large orthogonal impact on a domain around them that they're interested in. What about then? Do you think that age for someone that's going to make a massive impact, is there any evidence that you want them to start younger, that you want to back them when they're younger and less experienced because they're less tainted by the normal ways of doing things in a given field? Is there anything therefore thinking just about talent as measured by huge impact in building something new? Daniel: Of course, people like to at this point say most founders are young and then Juniper Networks and Jim Simons from RenTech and all these people that started their career actually relatively later on in life. So I think there are examples, both ways. I think it is a fair statement that by and large, if you had to average the age of successful tech founders, you would skew young. I mean, that is just the truth. Now, part of it is that those people don't actually fit into any other part of society. So it's not something innate with the youngness. Although I think there's definitely something there, but also these are outcasts that got fired from large companies, didn't fit into college, left. God bless the internet because it provides not just a great employment opportunity for these misfits, but also a way for them to make incredibly successful companies and obviously impact on the world. You definitely have the flip side though, in areas of management, say engineering management, as an example, a lot of the job is pattern recognition, both in the type of person that you're dealing with hiring. I've seen that type of person before. I've seen this type of situation before, and infrastructure decisions. The early stage companies with the early 20-year-old founder or whatnot, I'm saying this as someone who was, I was very young when I started my first company, you tend to succeed, in spite of the age sometimes, not because of. Because you make terrible infrastructure decisions, you have no infrastructure taste. So you're just trying things left and right. And you go through nine different decisions where someone who's seen something before, usually just helps you go to the best path. Sometimes the best teams are one where you have a relatively young founder and one or two people on the executive team that have seen things before now coming.Pitfalls here is obviously you don't want a bunch of suits in the room. The old Steve Jobs quotes everyone's heard whatnot, but it's helpful I think to have a balance just because there are roles where taste matters. I used to work at Apple. I used to run search machine learning at Apple. And one thing Apple thought of that I thought was interesting, there's this little pamphlet I got at some point of basically why I'm not a senior vice president and the responsibilities people have, all the way from the lowest rung of the organization to the CEO. And the way it was constructed is the cost of making an erroneous decision. How long of a time would take Apple to recover from that. A engineer, ranking file engineers, maybe three to four hours. Slightly more senior engineers, maybe a week. Manager is maybe two to three weeks. A director is maybe a month or two. A vice president is two or three quarters. And all the way up to senior vice president, is two or three years. And if Tim makes a strategic error, it could be a decade until Apple recovers. I think that's a good sense of also when you want a care of age, how large is the penalty of making a mistake? You would certainly not want your neurologist or anesthesiologist to tell you, ""Hey, I just got into Y Combinator and I read a few good Wikipedia articles and I'm ready to go."" That's another helpful way to think about age, is basically the cost of an error. Tyler: For all the talk about youth, I still think that something like 14 to 19 year olds remain underrated. And in particular, I'm thinking about the realm I work in, which is the world of ideas, where if you get something wrong, it can just be ignored. You're not throwing all of Apple, of course. And that if you want to shape ideas that you should be talking to, writing for, spending time with people in that age bracket, 14 to 19, they're so smart. They see things, they're fresh. They're willing to take chances, can be just full of energy. I think the rest of the world still doesn't see that. They put out their papers or their books for someone who's 47 years old and might review their book. That's fine. Not that those people don't matter, but they don't quite grasp that some kid who's 16 is smarter than they are and that's the person who's really going to matter. I think we're still underrating that in many areas. In finance and tech in particular, music, chess, those are mostly the domains of youth.",1276
122,"Daniel Gross, Tyler Cowen - Identifying Talent",The Utility of IQ Measures," Patrick: All of those make me think of intelligence, just raw intelligence. I'm curious what you learned about the utility of IQ or other measures, I'm not terribly familiar with measures beyond IQ and their relationship to talent. I'm thinking of David Rubenstein at Carlyle Group, who told me a couple weeks ago, very often the biggest problems were the highest IQ hires that they made. So there's an interesting question of, should high IQ be founders versus employees or managers? But what did you learn about IQ and its usefulness or where it may steer you wrong? Tyler: I think it's very often overrated. So for many jobs, you have to be at a certain level of smarts, but above that level, it doesn't correlate well with success. Let me just give you two statistical measurements. First is a study of Swedish CEOs, of the larger Swedish firms. The median Swedish CEO is at the 83rd percentile of IQ, which is pretty good, smarter than 83% of the rest of the Swedish people on average, but it's not exceptional. Before doing all the work for this book, I might have thought, well, that's going to be 95, 96, 97, for a lot of them 99, but 83, it's a little underwhelming. Here's another number lower in the distribution. If you move someone from the 25th percentile of IQ up to the 75th, that's a big leap, 50 percentile points. They will on average earn 10% to 16% more. Okay, I'd love to earn 16% more, but that's it. So, smart people in particular, I think they significantly overrate IQ, with the caveat that for a whole bunch of jobs, yes, of course you have to be above a certain level to do it at all. Patrick: I think that's right. These things tend to go in waves. If you listen to the Radiolab podcast of the early 2000s, their GIQ is a big deal. And now I think we've been talking about it so much, we're in this countercyclical wave. We're realizing there are limits to the returns of focus on IQ. I wholeheartedly agree with everything Tyler said, with the caveat that I think anyone certainly in this podcast recording that we're on, but also anyone probably listening to the podcast, exists in a very special world where most of the people they're surrounded by are very intelligent. When you leave that world, you realize there is a baseline of IQ that matters quite a bit for the roles that we're talking about. Productive employment, I think it's possible at many different ranges of IQ, but for top tier talent, there is definitely a baseline that matters, that if you don't have, it's going to be difficult. I think it is probably on the margin, still something that people might focus on maybe too much instead of too little. Tyler: I think there are also some jobs that fit what I would call the multiplicative model. Take someone like a Bill Gates, someone like that has to be in the very top tier of at least seven or eight different qualities. One would be energy, another would be work ethic, another would be IQ. And if even a single one of those falls away, Bill Gates can't be Bill Gates anymore. Those typically are very, very high level jobs where you've heard of the people who hold them and there, I think, a super high IQ is just an absolute prerequisite, but so are seven or eight other things. In the marginal sense, it's not only IQ that matters absolutely. Patrick: You reference this idea of outsider or outcast or somebody that rejected some institution that they were in. How important is all of that? What's beneath that as an interesting variable? Is it some set of early experiences? Is it a personality characteristic? I guess it's a nature/nurture question on outsiders and why they're important. Tyler: If you're an outsider, you take more chances. You're not surrounded by peers who want you to do a specific thing. I think that's super important. If I think of the chances I took in my own career that worked out very well, a large number, maybe all of them stemmed from the fact that I'm at George Mason University and not Harvard, and what's expected of me is simply something totally different. I'm allowed to define that for myself. No matter how independent minded you are, it's very hard to avoid conformism and getting locked into playing and winning a status game that maybe isn't the game that can matter. So if you're at Harvard, you want to publish a great number of papers and high impact journals. If you're talented, you can do very well at that. But for a lot of people, it's a dead end, in terms of actual influence or improving the world. And people from other places on average, they're going to do much worse, but some number of them will just do totally different things. And they're not worried about, ""Hey, what will my buddies at Harvard think of me?""",1105
123,"Daniel Gross, Tyler Cowen - Identifying Talent",How to Interview and Evaluate Talent," Patrick: I'd love to turn to the notion of evaluating talent. Obviously you've both done quite a lot of this and studied how others through it. I've got a few topics that I'd love to hear what you learned as you investigated them. Maybe the most interesting to me is this investigation of downtime, what people do in their downtime. I'd love you to outline why that's interesting and very specifically how you pull it out of somebody if you're interviewing them or doing a reference check or something. Talk to me about the utility of this variable. Daniel: It's kind of similar to this idea of why looking at someone's prior body of work is a bit better than a test. Meaning, given the universe of available options, the real test is what you decide to do every given second or moment and how you weigh your opportunity costs. It's exceptionally interesting, of course, to ask what people do when they don't have any particular obligations, so their downtime, the movies they watch, the activities they do, the books they read. You can just ask people what kind of movies, TV shows, books, subreddits, links you find interesting. Tyler taught me, which I think is a wonderful idea, there's many layers to thinking about the answer, but the first layer that's quite important is looking for specific answers instead of just generalizations. You ask someone about their favorite movies, it's really helpful if they say, ""I really liked The Matrix, I really liked Pulp Fiction, I really liked Catch Me If You Can,"" versus, ""Action movies and stuff."" There's something about that, the person who's able to articulate specific proper nouns. So that's definitely one baseline thing to work on. Tyler, what do you think? This is really an area where you're the master of this domain. Tyler: If the key thing you're trying to learn is how does the person work together in teams, small teams, everyone is prepped with their examples of how great they are or the mistakes they learn from, but ask them about a sports team. If they know basketball, the Los Angeles Lakers, why didn't they do well this year? Now you're not testing them about the knowledge of that. You want to pick something you know they know and they feel confident about, but if you get vague generalities, like their morale was low, well, okay, it might be true, but what exactly went wrong? Or if they know movies, well, in Star Wars, Luke, Leia and Han, they seem to make a lot of mistakes. What did they do wrong? Did they listen to Yoda too much? Talk me through that. They can't prep for that kind of question. And you get their understanding of personal dynamics.If they read a lot, ask them about their favorite Shakespeare play, Lady Macbeth, how evil is she? What was her big mistake? Whatever you think they can speak to and see how well they can speak to it. And you want to look for the questions, how well do they understand the hierarchies at work, in the situations they're perceiving? What kind of resentments come out when they're talking? What level of detail can they show and how varied and complex is their understanding of other human beings' psychological mechanisms? It's very hard for someone to fool you with that kind of test. Patrick: Is this all a study of their curiosity? Is that what it boils down to? Tyler: That too. So you can test their curiosity by seeing how many different areas they can talk intelligently about. But surely they ought to have one. You want to let them pick the area. You have to know something about it, but you're not testing their knowledge base. You're testing how well they can think about what they know best. Patrick: Tyler, do you have a favorite on-ramp question to get into this part of an interview with somebody, a way to get down this path that you ask often? Tyler: I'll look at their age and where they're from and whatever clues I have, and it could be books or movies or a travel spot or a sports team. I'm comfortable with any of those. Again, I'm trying to cater to their expertise. It can't be something I know nothing about. I can't say, ""Well, who's the greatest player in Canadian curling and how does he train?"" It's just harder for me to draw information from that, but I've hardly ever met a case where I can't ask them anything. Sometimes from other cultures, it's harder, Nigeria, but even there I'll talk about the Kuti family. Who were the generationally best performers and why, and how did they organize their groups? There's always something. Patrick: When learning about somebody, it's become very popular to say that interviews are maybe necessary, but not all that useful, whereas references can be incredibly useful at getting to know the underlying person. To what extent do you both agree with that concept? Do you value references? And this is very much, if you're trying to back somebody or invest in them or hire them. It's a specific context, but do you think that references is an art that's way more important than actually interviewing and getting to know the person directly? And if so, by how much? Daniel: I think the correct answer is definitely references are useful. One of the things Tyler I think asks people, not necessarily in interviews but in general is, one's equivalent of playing scales is. So if you're a pianist, you can sit in front of the piano every single day and play scales and just get better and better and better. And so finally you go to Carnegie hall, you step in on the Steinway and you play Moonlight Sonata and it all works. I think a different field is an interesting question. What is the thing I can do every day where I can just compound? And one in I think the particular area of talent is actually building a network in your field. That is a compounding activity, because that increases the value of the reference that you're going to get. The signal that you're going to get from a reference is strictly a function of just how close you are to that person. And obviously the closer you are, the more honest a read you'll get. There's all sorts of things you could do. You could force them to stack rank the individual somehow on a scale of one to 10, how good Bob was at software engineering is a good question. And then when they say eight and a half out of 10, you can say, ""Well, why is eight and a half the right number for them?"" And that gets you a little bit of alpha. That's helpful, because they might say things that aren't just effusively positive. You'll just get more signal if you know the person better.Actually a very helpful thing is to have you or the recruiter on your team have a very, very strong network somehow, because references are, earlier we made the case that their prior body of work is really the best way to evaluate someone and us nerds have code you can look at. But in all honesty, all roles are interpersonal, references are just their body of work, in quotes, that they've done, how fun they are to interact with. The other final little anecdote I'll say about references is it's always a great opportunity to use that as a way to source candidates, too. People don't take advantage of this, but let's imagine you're looking to hire someone to be a engineering manager of folks on your quant fund. You're now on the phone with that person's manager say, and so it's an amazing time to both A, try and hire them if they seem good, but B, just ask them, who else should we be talking to? It's a small trick I've used to great advantage over the years. Tyler: I think references are essential for jobs requiring a lot of conscientiousness that are mid-level, and then they absolutely rule. But especially if you're looking at very young people, I find references not useless, but why should you trust their judgment over yours? Say it's someone who's a teenager. Who is it you think they know that has better judgment than you? I think also for creativity, do their references have a high enough level of creativity to see this person's creativity? They might, but you certainly shouldn't assume they do. Again, especially for the young, a simple thought question, say Mark Zuckerberg at age 18 or Peter Thiel at that age, what are their references like? They're probably not negative, but the people they know at that time, are those people good enough to see how good Peter and Mark would become? Highly unclear. So there's some irreducible side of the equation, especially for creativity, especially for the young, where you have to use your own judgment. And if nothing else, you're ending up having to assess the referring person. So why not just assess the candidate himself or herself in those cases? But do both. Patrick: Do you think that there are any, beyond this idea of prior work and using the reference as the best way to understand prior work for a lot of people, is there anything else that you recommend people listening try to get out of a reference call as an objective? Tyler: Making the referrer feel safe to criticize, which is very hard to do. I wouldn't say you need to trick them, but you have to go overboard and ask something like, ""Would you work with this person?"" Or could you, in a ranked quantitative sense, compare them to other people might know? You have to really force their hand to get a slight downgrade of comment and then take that seriously when you hear that downgrade. Daniel: And the amount you have to work is strictly a function of how well you know that person, or how well you know the friend that referred you to that person. I think there's some type of composite function there. Patrick: One of the interesting chapters in the book is about disability. I find this area really interesting as it pertains to talent. We talked about specialization a little bit already. What did you learn about different kinds of disability and their relationship to talent? Maybe to start with a simple one, the concept of ADHD comes up. I don't know if you would call that a disability or not, but it's something that comes up a lot, certainly in my world. And very often, some of the most successful people have this condition and they've figured out how to control it or hone it or point at something specific. What did you learn about disability and what led you to write that chapter specifically? Tyler: I would say what we call disabilities very often are not. Maybe sometimes they would be for your entire life, but in the workplace with division of labor, you can be more obsessive or have a very specialized talent. People with ADHD, often they hone it and they use it to propel themselves forward. So one version of ADHD might be, well, you can never finish a book or finish a thought. I think that's less likely the case. If you use ADHD with, ""Well, I'm done with this Diet Coke, I want another. I'm done with this page, I'm going to turn the page. I'm getting bored with this book. So yes, I'm going to finish it, but I want to make sure I get to another book."" It becomes a positive propulsive mechanism and it's a high variance thing to have. But I think again, on average, it's correlated with success, not failure. Patrick: What about more extreme forms of disability? Whether that's something like autism and again maybe the same answer that you gave for ADHD in some ways, but what other forms of disability are interesting as it relates to talent that you studied? Tyler: Extreme is a hard word to use. Elon Musk gets on Saturday Night Live and says he's Asperger's, which is essentially the same as autism. He's the most successful, greatest entrepreneur of our generation. Again, I don't know how happy he is, but you need to take that seriously. My goodness, look at what he's done. His command of engineering is phenomenal. His ability to achieve, be out there in the public arena, create memes, everything. My goodness, how many major companies has he been a part of?I think high variance is the model. It's not that everyone with a so-called disability is actually a super person, but it's assigned to look more closely, what could this person do for me? And because they might be weird or come off weird, the chance you can hire them is actually probably much higher. If you understand what they're about, they may need some kind of special accommodation. Well, we understand you, we'll give you that, your chance of recruiting them is higher too.",2838
124,"Daniel Gross, Tyler Cowen - Identifying Talent",Finding A Correlation Between Talent and Happiness," Patrick: Do you think there's a relationship between happiness and talent? Do you think very talented people are less or more happy? Daniel: That classification of happiness type one, two, three. Type one is happy in the moment, I'm going down a rollercoaster ride, like rollercoasters. Type two is you're on a hike, it's tough. In hindsight, you reflect positively on it, but in the moment you wish you could stop. Type three is just, well, just sucks, both ways. My sense is certainly successful and I think talented people are more of the type two happiness. I actually don't think Elon has in the moment an amazing life. I think he's going to have years and decades and probably centuries of positive reflection on it, look how cool it was. But I think when you're at that last stage, what is it, the tending step on Everest, and you're just trying to make it to the top, I don't think that's fun at all. I think the average day in Elon's life is, there's a lot going on. I don't know how pleasurable it is. So maybe there's a difference between happiness and pleasure in that sense. It's also not clear to me, and this is more of a personal observation than one speaking that on behalf of literature, how much striving for happiness is the exclusive thing one should be seeking. I think that's a very Buddhist idea. I'm not sure that actually gets you to happiness, so to speak. Meaning, if you really strive for constant pleasure, happy, you do get a lot of type one happiness, but I'm not actually sure how long that lasts. The circuitry in the brain is very much triggered not to want that 24/7. So even if you're on a rollercoaster every day, by the 10th day, it's not that exciting. It's a bit of a meandering answer.One final thing I will say, which is I do find talented people's default state, many, not all, but it is something to look for. Their default state, giving say the same set of inputs, if you give say the same set of stimulus to 10 different people and whatever you want to define stimulus as, a series of Gmail messages, some good, some bad, hype, whatever, the default optimism I find talent people have is a bit greater. The belief that things will be great, things are great, things will continue to be great. That does seem to be a bit more present. What I've always wondered is to the extent to which that is a biomechanical mechanism, as opposed to it being something psychological. I really do wonder for just a sense of liveliness and vitality, and now we're really going off the rails. But to what extent are folks that are just not happy by default, to what extent is that something physical, some type of vagus nerve, biome thing? And you certainly know as an extreme, if one is actually sick. If you have the flu, you're not happy. That's an extreme. If you sleep really well and it's a great day and there's sunshine outside, you are happy. Maybe that's not a zero to one. Maybe it's not a binary continuum. And so maybe you can be 1% of just sick. Maybe some people are like that a lot. There's all sorts of wacky evidence to indicate the fact. But that's often what I really wonder when I meet people that are morose all the time, is the extent to which... I'm not a psychologist, but I really do wonder, is that really some childhood trauma, whatever thing? Or is it something physical in the body that's driving the mind to predict lower odds of good scenarios and higher odds of bad scenarios? Tyler: I would put it this way. I look for a positive sense of agency, ability to experience and enjoy flow. And the person not being that content, that trifecta together, I think is very powerful. I would second Daniel's remarks on the physical. I feel this myself. If I'm trying to write something, my body has to be able to squirm in the proper way for me to get the writing done. And it doesn't make any sense. I'm not saying it's the same setup for everyone, but each person has his or her physical requirements. Are those satisfied in the person? Can they be satisfied? Does the person understand how to mobilize them? Those are good questions. Patrick: Say more about the lack of contentment as your third thing that you said there. Is this just something that we're unsatisfied at the present, so you're compelled to continue an exploration? Is that the general idea? What is it about contentment that's important, or lack thereof rather? Tyler: For leadership roles, it should be there's never enough. It's partly something that feeds into charisma, but it's also a belief you want for its own sake. If the person can be made happy by some set of achievements, that to me is definitely a negative, it should never be enough. A kind of restlessness, never happy enough with themselves, always cresting for the next thing, the new thing, the higher level. It depends on the sector, but it ought to be something where there's not a plateau. Patrick: When I was in Beijing as a ninth grader, there was a group of people outside our hotel that were doing Tai Chi every morning. And at the time, I did a bunch of karate. In karate, you do these katas where you memorize moves and then perform this thing. I watched them and then I tried to join them and an older woman slapped me on the wrist and said, ""At your age, you shouldn't be doing Tai Chi, because it will kill your ambition. You won't want to do anything else. You'll be content. That's a problem."" Does that speak to you at all? Do you think that- Tyler: Absolutely. Patrick: But that seems like a good thing. Tyler: I'm against good things. Patrick: You're against good things. Say more. Tyler: It's partly in jest, but the notion of a good thing is a little too complacent for me. It's a challenging thing and maybe in a deep way, that makes you happier, but don't focus on the happiness, focus on the process, focus on the thing, focus on your quest. Maybe you'll end up happy. Don't think too much about happiness and be suspicious of people who think a lot about unhappiness. I think often they're miserable and they wallow too much in something or other, and they end up as complainers. Patrick: Tyler, from the cheap seats, you seem, maybe content's the wrong word, you seem extremely enlivened by the things that you do. Intellectual investigation, conversations, writing ideas. Is that not contentment? What am I missing there? Tyler: Well, I always want to do more. Typically, I've always been starting some new project, but it helps me maintain a very high energy level. Let's write another book, let's do another podcast. The old Ernest Banks saying, ""Let's play two."" He meant doubleheaders, but it's a general idea. It's part of my life philosophy, let's play two. Patrick: It's interesting, before we hit record, I said what's a book that is your favorite looking back, and you said the next one. So it stands up pretty cleanly. Tyler: But ask Daniel about me, he'll give a better answer than I would. Or ask me about him. Patrick: Yeah, what do you think, Daniel? Daniel: Well, I think Tyler has a very unique ability to consistently produce writing output, which I think is a more mature version of the same mind that excelled at playing chess early on in life, it's a very taxing cognitive thing to do. Most people have the dread task of oh, I need to go write the thing and maybe I'll get to that tomorrow, not today. Tyler is the opposite mode of that, where he's effectively writing every day. So I think that is a mixture of mental stamina and mental ability. It's an interesting question for someone to ask Tyler that I've certainly asked in the past, you have that experience where you're writing something and it starts out good, and then as you're writing, realize halfway through everything I wrote doesn't make sense, and that original point actually don't know if it connects to us so I'll get back to it tomorrow.But he's working through that puzzle every day, which I think is very impressive, it just takes a certain sense of fortitude. In reality, probably the most interesting thing is the fact that I don't think it's a huge Jocko Willink, David Goggins struggle for him that he's pushing through some type of courage, and fortitude, and attaboy stuff. I just think it happens. And when you meet people who are really excellent at a particular field, I always find it fascinating where some of them are just not trying that hard, they just are. That photo of Usain Bolt running that nine second smiling and making it look easy. And Kipchoge breaking the marathon record, also making it look easy. There's a related thing going on there, which is people that truly excel at something, they're not trying that hard, they just are good at it. Patrick: Tyler, how do you see Daniel as most talented. Tyler: Combination of things. First, an extreme intelligence from birth, which is important for him, but a willingness and desire to see things differently, and see and articulate an angle to a problem that the other very smart people around him just do not see. So on the surface, he's relatively quiet in a group, but is thinking more, calculating more than the other people there and will come up with something they haven't thought of. And then he combines that with the desire and ability to build something from that. So not just well, I saw that people like that on Twitter. Oh, I'm so great. But it has to be converted into something quite tangible and physical. So I think the physical is a big part of Daniel's excellence. He's run marathons in Antarctica. That's not an incidental fact about him. What he's trying to do with those smarts assessing projects people is to turn it into some real life equivalent of running the marathon in Antarctica, and his ability to integrate the software of his mind with the hardware of the concrete ambition. I think Daniel is just an A+. How's that, Daniel? Patrick: Pretty good. It's a great excuse to talk about the physical. Daniel and I have talked a lot about running in the past. The Usain Bolt thing is a great example. You mentioned this physical restlessness you need, Tyler. What is the prescription or the RX coming out of this research for how should people think about the physical side of their lives? Even if I think most of the book and most of what we're talking about and thinking about here is mental talent, what is the supporting physical infrastructure beneath that that's interesting, if anything? Tyler: I think everyone should exercise every day, if only for investment reasons, but at a deeper level, to understand your own physicality and how it interacts with your mental output is a great way to become more productive. And there's not going to be any single answer that's going to hold for everyone, but that I need to squirm on the couch in a certain way. Well kind of unique to me, but I understand that and it helps me write better. So to figure out what for you is like me squirming on the couch, I strongly recommend. Patrick: Daniel, what have you gotten out of running? Why is this so important? Daniel: It's funny, I'm smiling because the pursuit of maximizing the self improvement, quantified self stuff, I find this a funny scene where zero interest in the field is a bad sign, 110% interest in the field is just as bad a sign. In reality, I find most productive people have very deep, very private and secret interest in the field would never ask someone all those Tim Ferriss, although I think Tim Ferriss is great, but that style of what's your daily routine? Do you take cold showers? But secretly are wondering if they should be taking cold showers. That's where I sit. Running happens to be the thing I've chosen to self identify as and do every day, or almost every day.It is funny how actually productive people, when you meet them behind the scenes, there's a veneer that they're really not doing much. Some of them are, so some of them just do sleep in magnificently every night, and really don't work out, and actually seem very healthy and vibrant, but find a lot secretly in the QS scene, but don't really want to talk about it too much. And I think that's probably the healthy balance to have. So I'm not here to reveal any daily routines I have, I'm 1% of successful of the guests that you've had on your show so I'm not the person you should be asking, but if you do manage to get Ken Griffin to talk about his sauna cycling, I think that'd be helpful. Patrick: Were there frustrating aspects of the research part of this project? Meaning things that you wanted to learn that just didn't have answers, or hypotheses that were just totally wrong, or unsatisfying things. What was frustrating about this book? Daniel: I'll say one thing, I'll let Tyler comment, not just with this book but in general, I have been a bit frustrated with the disconnect between the world of social sciences and the most cutting edge machine learning that we have available to us today. I think there's a bit of a selection effect of who goes into what field in industry, but you read a study that's reportedly showing results, and studies are truth. That's what we learned over COVID, the study is true, expert checkers and experts agree, it's true. But in reality, these things are we got 40 people in the room and we asked them to fill out a Google form four times. But there's so many obvious experiments you would look for.If you were running this as a machine learning team at TikTok, you'd just say, ""Well, can we take the text output people have and put it into different clusters and heaps, not label them but put it into different clusters and heaps so that we can figure out the different writing styles people have?"" Maybe you do the same with video, maybe you do the same with images, the profile pictures people select for themselves on social media. Gosh, that's got to be predictive in different ways. And there are a few things here and there about it, but nothing really that's gone deep. No-one's really brought the arsenal of tools that machine learning offers into social science with the correct level of depth. I run a small company that's doing a little bit of this, but I'm disappointed that there's no open AI for psychology, so to speak. Tyler, what's your take. Tyler: I would second all that. There are just very few research papers in these areas that I trust and the ones I trust the most tend to show factor X is only so important. IQ is only so important. Conscientiousness is only so important. Those actually seem to replicate. The papers that make bigger claims about something being very important tend to fall apart or they're so context specific you have to be very careful with them, but more and more I think of the quest for talent as a kind of art. Now in the arts, you can understand works of music, or painting, or movies far better or far worse, but it's hard to give people fixed rules.You wouldn't say, ""Well, always buy the paintings with red in them or paintings with dogs in them."" That'd be pretty crazy. But if you look at enough paintings and talk about paintings with other smart people, you'll understand paintings much, much better, and you can do that with talent. There's something ineffable about the success and if you look at some of the biggest successes, such as Peter Thiel, who has this incredible record, Peter is not a formulaic talent searcher, it's highly intuitive, it's almost a kind of moral judgment. His own background is in the humanities, not in number crunching, and that is itself interesting.",3707
125,"Daniel Gross, Tyler Cowen - Identifying Talent",Models and Datasets for Thinking About Talent," Patrick: When building good models, the size of the dataset, we've learned from modern AI research, is incredibly important. You both have huge what I'll call reference classes of people and talented people, and you both actively are searching for talent all the time, whether that's to invest in, or interview, or write about, or back through grants. This is something that matters greatly to both of you. What has changed, if anything, the most about how you evaluate talent from before beginning this project to now, as a result of the work? Tyler: I would say where the person has ended up. Not where they come from, but geographical location predicts talent more than I had thought, and I find this actually somewhat discomforting since it could have dangerous political implications that you have talent so concentrated say in South England, near New York City, Bay Area, some other places, parts of India, but the people who are really talented actually are able very often to make the efforts to get themselves to those places more than I had thought. And I already had thought that. Daniel: For me, the big model update has actually been one that I got from Tyler. I'd started an organization that built our own IQ test, we built our own psychometrics test. We went really deep and really climbed all the way up and now all the way down the Dunning-Kruger chart of belief in that stuff. And I've greatly reduced my priors about all of those things with the exceptions that I mentioned earlier, so as a way to provide taxonomy and language to a team and whatnot, and increase my beliefs to Tyler's point on that prior body of work.It's funny, my sister is an organizational psychologist, and I remember coming up to her after I learned about the Big Five Aspect Scales, and started to work on implementing our own version of it. She said, ""Oh, you're in the Big Five Aspect Scales halo. Come back to me in a year, let's check in and see where you are."" And she's totally right. I do think when people first learn about it, they have a tendency to believe that it is the ultimate utensil for understanding people and whatnot. Again, it's useful as language, but I rate that stuff far lower because I've realized how the sausage is made and the factory doesn't look great. Until we have better tools, the work is the way to go. Tyler: Another revision I have had is to focus a bit more not on whom can I find, but who will find me? And it's thinking about the problem in reverse, you don't want it to be either too hard or too easy for someone to find you, at least for what I'm doing. That is at least as important as me showing up, talking to a person, meeting them, reading their work, whatever, and making my judgment. Who's attracted to me? If you're not going to get that right, it's hard to do well. Patrick: I'll call that the bat signal effect. What have you learned about doing that well? What represents a good bat signal? Tyler: When I interview candidates for emergent ventures and they say, ""Oh, I'm your biggest fan. I've read all your this, heard all your podcasts,"" they are not usually the best candidates. They're usually smart, curious people who don't have that much to do. The very best candidates tend to be, ""I have a friend who loves your stuff. I listened to one of your podcasts before this interview."" They've learned who I am, they have some mental model, but they're not a fan. And I find that very interesting. It shows it's about your soft network. You can't rely just on your hard network but who your hard network will bring in as your soft network. You need to be out there in some way with an image that corresponds to what you're trying to pull in and help fund, hire, whatever the case may be. Patrick: Daniel, have you learned anything about this through Pioneer in terms of throwing up the right signal to attract the right people? The pull versus the push. Daniel: You definitely come across folks who really admire the individual to the point where you realize the fact that you are filling some type of heroic protagonist role model in their life speaks to something that they're missing more than something they have. Something I saw at YC too, we've come to fear those people. The best people are trying to use your platform to their advantage. It's a great feeling to feel like I'm being slightly taken advantage of. You are a step on the staircase. I'll be stepping on you now to get over here. And it's great, we'd love to invest in people like that. And as they step on us, we buy a little bit of equity and they continue on. You're really something that they're using as opposed to being the destination.Probably it is a thing that as we become more successful will get worse and worse, and you see the extreme of this, super successful businessmen seem to attract around them these silver tongue types that really like them and admire them. And it does start to distort the thinking of some of these folks when your entire audience are these court jesters that really needed a hero in life, you are that hero, they're trying to appease you. I think it's a very unhealthy psychological cycle to fall into. You always have to really make sure, first, when you come across someone like that, and they compliment you, and whatnot, it takes a while to develop T cell immunity to that. At some point, I think it's very important to become highly allergic to those dynamics, and really focus on people that might know you and respect to you, but there's a specific goal that's not you that they're trying to achieve that you might be helpful to get them to another planet. Tyler: And you need to be very careful. If the compliments are true, it can be worse. The people who BS you and say things nice about you that aren't true, there's actually maybe a greater chance they're the ones who want to use you. So if you say to yourself, ""Well, that person flatters me but the things he or she says are true, so that's a good channel of information,"" that's a very dangerous path to go down. In fact, it may be more dangerous than having some pure BSers by you. Patrick: There's a section of the book I've intentionally avoided, the area of these personality inventories. You've referenced them a few times and I think, as you go down this path, you are enamored with them originally, because there's this physics envy that exists in the non physics field, you want stuff to jam into a formula. But still if they're useful as a language, whether it's MBTI, or OCEAN, or Enneagram, or whatever it is, is there one that you recommend people check out just to develop that sense of language, that descriptive language around personality characteristics or types? Daniel: I think the least bad is the Big Five Aspect Scale. Tyler: And it's only five, thank goodness. There's a version of it, the Big 16. It may have a higher R-squared in statistical terms, but you can't use 16 concepts with your team. So big five it is, with a ton of qualifications. Patrick: You mentioned this notion of geography, which makes me think a little bit of the frictions that might exist between someone talented and getting to one of these hubs of creativity, or cities, or whatever that might lead to something really interesting because they're a talented person. Say a little bit about the frictions that you investigated that could be areas of bias that are big topics today, whether that be gender bias, or racial bias, or something else. What factor did these sorts of frictions or biases play in talent achieving its highest possible success rate? Tyler: The most obvious is immigration law but the one that maybe you can change that is still way under discussed is it is much, much harder for women, especially younger women, to develop mentors in today's world. There's a number of ways you can put it with different balances, depending on say how feminist you are, but one is the risk the woman may be harassed. Another is the risk that the man will feel vulnerable because the woman can charge he was harassing her or just create some kind of negative impression. But no matter how you want to frame it, I'm convinced that is a major, major factor holding back especially younger women that we're not doing a very good job of addressing. Arguably, in some ways we're making it worse by making the issue more fraught. You do definitely want to protect women against harassment but I don't feel right now we have very good institutions for men mentoring women. Patrick: Anything you'd highlight, Daniel, in that area? Daniel: I think an interesting open question is whether Zoom makes things better or worse. I've heard both sides of this. Tyler, actually what do you think in terms of say mentor development for women, the reality of remote work? Is that a plus or a minus? Tyler: I hear from a large number that it's a plus. I'm not sure I know enough to have my own judgment but I take those reports seriously, from women. And that in a broader Zoom conversation, they feel they're cut off less and that it's more egalitarian. I hear that a lot too. Daniel: Yeah.",2160
126,"Daniel Gross, Tyler Cowen - Identifying Talent",Talent as the Rate Limiter on Global Progress," Patrick: In a recent conversation with Antonio Gracias, who was the first big institutional backer of Elon's company, SpaceX and Tesla, we were talking about the sorts of talent, the supply of which are a rate limiter on progress in the world. It's tightened a little bit here, but there's abundant financial capital that doesn't seem to be a major rate limiter in innovation, or great new companies, or institutions being formed. So talent seems to be the rate limiter. And I was interested to hear Antonio say, ""Look, it's actually probably not that we need a hundred more Elons, it's that we need the layer of talent beneath that enable the rare genius like an Elon to do more and create more leverage for that type of person."" I was surprised by that answer, given that he was Elon's big backer and I think would agree with us all that he's a remarkable entrepreneur. What do you guys think is the most important supply constraint type of talent today that, if you could just snap it into existence, would make the world a much better place? Daniel: On the Elon point, I think it's an interesting question. There's a bit of a reflexive loop there where it's someone with the intellectual gravitas and then subsequent market success like Elon that then attracts the executive bench underneath him. So you have this chicken and egg dynamic where I think a lot of what's going on for Elon today is he can attract talent no-one else can attract. That's part of the star power moat that he has, along with some other regulatory benefits. I don't know that would actually be the shortage. I think there's some basic base rate of how many humans there are in the world that we're creating every year that are both very talented in the world of engineering with numbers, and shapes, and code, and with other people. For reasons that are pretty deep that I don't really understand, we're pretty decent at creating outliers in either direction. It's very rare to find someone that has both. That's actually a real constriction. Not only do we not create enough of them, but we also don't slot most of them, I think, into the right roles. There's a very big inefficiency that we'll probably only realize once we have it fully figured out, and I don't know if this is going to be some type of whimsical techno punk future where the AI is routing jobs.I'm certainly not signing up for that first to be turned into a professional garbage can collector probably, but I think there's a lot of people that are not sorted into the right jobs. I think that's a raison d'être for the book, at the end of the day, it is a not a capital problem but there's a significantly outdated operating system running on the minds of different people around the world who are responsible for finding the right person for the right job. I think if we could route people more appropriately, we would get more SpaceXs, and more Teslas, and more Apples, and Googles. The free market has this awesome process of grade of destruction that has that happen occasionally. A different way of saying this is startups should have a much lower failure rate if we were able to route everyone properly to do the right thing. We have high failure rate, people can celebrate it because successes are so big, but things can be much better. Many more startups can be successful if you were able to route people to the right jobs. And I think that's true over the whole economy, a middle manager at some fortune 500 company as well as a VC picking the next startup. Tyler: I think there's failures at every level and it's interesting for me to look at the pandemic. Some of our public health institutions failed pretty badly. The CDC, the NIH, they failed at every level, they're on a automatic pilot. And we only really saw that when there was a particular discrete emergency. Now, when it comes to talent, while I would say there's an emergency every moment, there's not, from one month to the next, some obvious new emergency that pops up so we don't see what we saw as the failures of say the CDC in the world of talent. But imagine the talent allocation process as being like the CDC, and the failures are just always there at multiple levels, and we continue down the path on bureaucratized solutions that are actually good enough for maintaining our current level of GDP. Most years, it doesn't go down. We could do much, much better and people who are worried about income inequality as a problem, that is simply the other side of the coin of talent allocation. I would say talent misallocation. Patrick: What would you redesign, Tyler, about what I'll call the attractors or the filters for talent? Whether it's, let's take colleges as an example, that are designed to first attract, then evaluate and then foster talent at different levels. What's most broken about them? Or said differently, if you were designing one of those institutions ... YC is interesting in this regard for founder talent, if you were designing a new talent filter institution, what would it look like relative to the ones that we mostly rely on still today, especially colleges? Tyler: Well, if you take universities where I work, it's striking to me how slowly they react. So as we know right now, there's a crisis in Ukraine. A university should be raising its hands and saying, we're going to open up 10, 50, a hundred, even just five, even just one slot for a super talented Ukrainian student, pay their way, take care of their visa problems and bring them in. The number of schools that have actually done that, as opposed to the press releases, which I've read and looked into, who's actually doing what, is remarkably small. Schools are not set up to adapt quickly to make, say, 10% of education at a school online can take schools many years to do. If they get there ever. That's a way of attracting talent that doesn't want to show up every morning to take classes. In general, flexibility and speed of reaction are poor across most of our larger institutions. Patrick: If you were designing something as a filter, any ideas there for what might make ... I'm always struck by Paul Graham's original, I think it was Russ Roberts that interviewed him back in 2008 or 2009. And he described YC as this assembly line that they were trying to make the throughput of the factory as efficient and fast as possible, as high a throughput as possible. Are there ways that we could do this in a more self-served way? I think of the CFA exam and finance as an interesting one of, yeah, if you get through that thing, you definitely have the ability to work really hard and you're smart enough. It says something about you and it self-serve in a way, should we have more of that designations or tests or filters that are more scalable? Tyler: I'm all for competency testing, but there's so many layers at which the problem has to be fixed. Just another simple one from my area, universities, mid-century it was not so unusual to have American university presidents at top schools in their late twenties. Now, if you're 60, you might be considered too young. That is crazy. It's only one thing fixing that one thing may not change matters, but if you realize there's 30, 40 things like that and to get on the path of fixing each and every one to make our key institutions more dynamic, faster to change better at allocating talent. Patrick: What is the biggest open question for each of you about talent at large? Tyler: This is super practical for me, selfishly. I'm not saying it's the biggest social problem, but in the context of a brief interview or interaction to assess who has durability, I find that much harder than assessing energy or smarts or even conscientiousness. Durability. They'll stick with it. They'll persist. Very hard for me to get a handle on that. Obviously older people, you just look at the records, basically going to tell you. Younger people, there's not a record. How do you know? Daniel: In physics, we have a pretty good understanding that seems to only change on quotes every 200 years or so about how the universe in the world works. But we have pretty good frameworks now that Plank and Einstein to Newton, to some extent, put in place. We don't really have that physics blueprint for assessing someone in an interview. I'd like to have something that's as durable, meaning it's a science that'll last at least a hundred years. Truths are reinvented even in physics every couple hundred years or so. So something to last at least a hundred years of just how to given a set of inputs and say 60 minutes of interaction with a human, predict how they would respond to different environments over the course of multiple years. And if we had a greater ability to do that, whatever metric you want, global economy, technological progress, a lot of things would accelerate much faster. So this particular Torah we don't have yet. And the book is really the beginning of the conversation that hopefully will result in the creation of this science. I think that's the real thing missing from the world. Patrick: Daniel, do you think that the reason why that's hard is that it's almost like a priced marketplace for talent? That it is more of a relative game than an absolute one. And therefore that science can never exist because it'll always be changing because it's so competitive versus a ball dropping that can be measured. It's going to be the same every time. Daniel: Nature doesn't respond to you at the same speed that other humans do. I think this is a fair counterpoint. But if we look at markets is an example of this, there are quant funds, you would know better than me, that outperform the market consistently. Some of them for a very long time. So there are ways, even in reflexive dynamics, to have some sense of real truth. I agree with you that it's harder said than done because Earth is not changing gravity based on whether you're dropping a ball. But there's still, I think, a way we can probably get there. And it does not have to be adversarial like markets, by the way. No one wants to be sorted or selected for a job that they do not enjoy. And people seem to be at their best when they enjoy what they do. So I think there's a way to make it happen in a win-win dynamic. Patrick: I'll definitely remember the book for this idea of energy durability and curiosity really is the three things that I personally took away from it as things to screen for, think about, test for, ask questions around. Highly recommend everyone check out the book. I think this conversation is critical for everyone listening. Daniel, you know my traditional closing question, I've already asked it of you last time we talked. So I'll ask it of Tyler this time. Tyler, what is the kindest thing that anyone's ever done for you? Tyler: My mother was an incredible and loving mother and I think that is still underrated in our society. And she drove me around to chess tournaments when I was 10 years old and couldn't get around by myself. That was formative for my later development and she never asked what was in it for her. It's got to be mom. Patrick: Love it. Simple. Wonderful answer. Guys, thank you so much for your time today. Thanks for writing the book. I hope there's a sequel. Really appreciate it. Tyler: Thank you. Daniel: Thank you for having us.This site uses cookies to improve your browsing experience. By using this site, you are consenting to this policy.",2621
127,Jeff Jordan - Building & Investing in Marketplaces,Introduction," Patrick: Our guest today is Jeff Jordan, general partner at Andreessen Horowitz. Jeff has one of the most interesting set of experiences of the guests that I've had on the show. As an operator, he has been the general manager of ebay.com, president of PayPal and CEO of OpenTable. As an investor, he was one of the first general partners in Andreessen Horowitz and sits on the board of Airbnb, Instacart, Pinterest, and other notable firms. Given his vast experience, he is the firm's go-to expert on all things marketplaces, which is the common thread in our conversation. Please enjoy this great discussion with Jeff Jordan.",146
128,Jeff Jordan - Building & Investing in Marketplaces,A Primer on Marketplaces," Patrick: Jeff, I really struggled as I was reviewing our research before our call today on where the hell to start with you. We've got such a wealth of stuff to cover. I think marketplaces is such a common theme through your career that it would be a fun place to start, both because you've got so much operating and investing experience in this area. The place that I've chosen as an on-ramp is your notion of perfect competition. I think it's a really interesting idea that I'd love you to explain to us as an excuse to talk about all facets of marketplaces building and investing. Jeff: I got my first taste of marketplaces at eBay, Web 1 if you want to call it that. Almost all of the best business models ended up being marketplace type models, Taobao and Alibaba in China, you have Rakuten in Japan, Mercado Libre in South America, now Amazon is largely a marketplace. At that point, it was brand new. There was no playbook. Early at eBay, I got there in 99, you're sitting there like, ""Okay, what do we do?"" So the model that worked best in trying to figure out how to grow eBay was basically microeconomics. It is a perfect, at least it was a perfect economy where it was self-contained and all of the things in economic theory of microeconomics were playing out on eBay. And so we made pricing decisions based on that supply acquisition decisions. You just watch, it would work as predicted. It was fascinating, we started getting tons of requests from academia, including by the way, the current dean of the Stanford Business School I subsequently learned to get the data to test their theories. Fascinating little machine. My right hand guy, Michael Dearing of Harrison Metal, he had the same model and so we just sit there geeking out on what happens when... Kind of thing it was really fun. Patrick: So if you think about this notion of perfect competition, how should maybe a marketplace entrepreneur think about that concept? If you're designing a marketplace from the bottom up, why is perfect competition a key notion in terms of how you should build or what you should build? Jeff: Yeah, it's where supply meets demand than determines pricing. My partner, Andrew Chen just wrote a book called The Cold Start Problem. He was talking about the hard side of the marketplace and every marketplace you're constantly challenged to keep it in equilibrium. You'd watch it play out in eBay, there'd be certain areas where an entrepreneur would find a inefficiency where they could list items and make disproportionate yields because of scarcity. They were chewing off the very top of the price curve and then other sellers would observe that activity, fill the gap and the pricing then would regress to where it rationally should be. Sometimes there's supply inefficiencies, sometimes there's demand inefficiencies. And the two would very quickly resolve over time, essentially a two sided marketplace. You're trying to figure out how do I keep these two in equilibrium. Patrick: eBay, since it's literally the perfect model of a marketplace is maybe the place to focus on for now. What kinds of actions did that mean when you were at eBay operating to try to promote price discovery or price equilibrium or something like that? What were you literally doing? Jeff: The most interesting thing is early on we try all these initiatives that we baked on our own and debuted the community. And we found out the leverage was way more to watch what the nascent behavior the community was doing and seek to amplify it. So the iconic thing there is Simon Rothman who's bounced around. He's a Valley veteran now. Early on in his career was just a early exec there and he has a very high interest in collectible cars. And one day I think he was searching for Maserati or Ferrari and expecting to see little replica cars and he found real ones. And it's just like, ""Why are people selling Lamborghini's on eBay?"" Well, it turned out Lamborghini's are only sold on the coasts. And so if you're in the middle of the country, it's very hard to buy one typically and eBay entrepreneurs were figuring out, ""Okay, here's what we do."" So we took that nascent behavior and built eBay Motors, which then made it much easier to list and discover cars, generated the supply and created the awareness. The best actions we had was watch that nascent community behavior and amplify. Patrick: When you're looking at a new marketplace for the first time, I'll hold off on the discussion between horizontal and vertical marketplaces which we'll come to at some point. But if you're just looking de novo at a marketplace as an investor with your investor hat on, what are the features that you are zoomed in on most quickly that matter to you with all this experience? Jeff: Two main ones. One is fragmentation of the marketplace. I often have used the difference between OpenTable and Fandango in explaining this. OpenTable, the average restaurant owner on OpenTable owns one restaurant. And so aggregating them is a pain in the ass. But once you've aggregated them, it's a very valuable thing. Whereas Fandango basically has deals with the five or six major theater chains and any one of them can have market power because if AMC pulls out of Fandango, I am motivated to go to amc.com and figure it out. When I was explaining this theory to a fellow board member and accolade Michael Klein and I explained the theory and he looks at me very quizzically and I go, ""What?"" He goes, ""You do know I'm the founder of Fandango, right?"" You're like, ""Oh crap."" So one is fragmentation.The other is ideally lead gen. You're creating relationships that otherwise wouldn't have been created. The thing you try to avoid is ""Okay, I have a relationship with my car repair man, my hair stylist, my whatever and it's a frequent relationship."" Those don't do well because the service provider, they'll pay a little bit for convenience. They'll pay a whole lot for a new customer. Ideally you have a combination of currently inefficient market that's very fragmented and lead gen is a part of it. So Airbnb has lead gen. Hosts are being introduced to guests they never would've known. It's spectacularly fragmented. The average host owns one property. It has those two characteristics. Patrick: Maybe we should just go read Andrew's book to answer this question, but what have you seen in common amongst marketplace businesses that are especially good at thinking about that lead gen part of the equation? Because the fragmented supply side or the fragmented supplier base, like you said, it's a pain in the ass to get them all, but it's kind of straightforward, like you just got to go get them all. What about on that other side, what's shared in common amongst the most talented people that you've seen thinking through this problem of lead gen? Jeff: The best models are ones that don't really rely much on paid acquisition. The best entrepreneurs have figured out hacks to get user demand at scale through a user proposition. And one of the most brilliant hacks on this was the OpenTable hack that preceded me. The team figured it out ahead of time is they build a widget that restaurants could put on their own websites to empower online reservations, because the typical behavior at the time is ""I want to go to The Slanted Door."" Okay, let me search on Google for the Slanted Door so I can find the telephone number. Go to the website and you see this widget that says make an online reservation. It's just like, ""Oh I'd rather do that than pick up the phone and have that experience of, 'Can you hold sir?' get back to you and then call multiple restaurants."" Just awful.And so we put it on there and what it ended up doing, the diner would click on it and was redirected to The Slanted Door page on OpenTable. They would then discover, ""Oh my God, I can make an online reservation at all these"" and they'd come back to OpenTable. They wouldn't go back to Google. They'd quickly learn a behavior to go do OpenTable. OpenTable was getting paid to acquire their restaurants consumers. While I was there, we didn't spend a penny on demand acquisition and we're growing very nicely based on that. So the best models don't really rely on paid. They figured out some other way to get that distribution. Patrick: Setting aside the negative aspect of concentrated supply base or bad lead gen, what other red flags do you see that worry you if you're looking at a new marketplace business, like what would be things that you would not want to see if you were considering investing? Jeff: Cohorts just tell you so much about what is happening. One of our partners, Olivia Moore just wrote a very nice blog post on leaky bucket problem where if you can attract a lot of people, that's a very bullish sign. If the cohort curve never bottoms out and just keeps going down, that's just plain smashing it at the ground. I get very worried on that metric. If you just need fresh meat to grow, you'll reach a growth constraint at some point.",2031
129,Jeff Jordan - Building & Investing in Marketplaces,Jeff's Background and Taking OpenTable Public," Patrick: You have an incredible, interesting operating background before even getting to Andreessen Horowitz - at Disney, then eBay, then PayPal, then OpenTable, you mentioned some of these things. I'd love to go one by one and hear what stands out most in memory in terms of major business lesson learned starting all the way back with Disney, which I think you were basically most of the 90s, you were at Disney working with Meg Whitman. What stands out in memory there as the biggest lesson learned? Jeff: The amount of young talent that Michael Eisner and Frank Wells attracted to that company was just remarkable. I was in the consumer products division. It's the third child of the company, the theme parks and the entertainment studio. So consumer products was like, okay, it's a bit of an afterthought. The execs I worked there including Meg was my hiring manager. So she had an okay career. I worked with Paul Pressler who became CEO of the Gap. I worked closely with Steve Burke who had a long career at Comcast and NBC Universal. Everywhere you looked there was unbelievable talent. That made an impression on me of like company had a 10 year run that was amazing and it was driven by a bunch of 30 year olds at the time, which was very counter to what Hollywood was about. The big lesson for me on Disney was just talent. Patrick: Talent density. Obviously eBay is sort of like patient zero for this online digital marketplace concept. I'm sure working with Pierre there was a fascinating experience. You were there right in the thick of it. What stands out as the most important things that you learned as an operator at eBay? Jeff: I learned to be an operator. I'd only had a couple semi operating jobs up to that point. While I was a CFO at the Disney stores, I was also responsible for managing the Disney stores in Japan, but we had someone on the ground so I was kind of overseeing the person who was overseeing it. When I got to eBay, I'd never really run anything. And so I joined, Meg was building bench depth so she found a job for me and had me managing two people, one of whom promptly quit to go run a Baja Fresh franchise, which at that point might not have been the best financial decision unless he owns Baja Fresh at this point. I was managing one person, then a few months in she reorganized and gave me eBay North America, which was the ebay.com website. Seven years later, I was managing 5,000 people.One of the blog posts that I get the most comments on is I think it's titled Leaving It All On the Field. It brings a sports analogy to managing a hyper growth business. Because early on you're the player, things are crashing around you and you're making every call. And then there was a point where I remember one night when I go home, I get to work at 5:00 AM and it's seven at night, there's still a line outside my door waiting for me to make decisions. I go, ""This is not scaling. I got to change something.""And you become a coach. You hire a bunch of people. You try to get them into a place where they'd make most of decisions similar to how you would. And then the mode's very different. You turn into a coach. At some point with hyper growth, they can't make all the decisions. So they have to build a team. They become the coach and you become a general manager and you're further and further from the action in the field each time.And then take it to its logical conclusion, at PayPal with 5,000 people I was commissioner of the league. And it's interesting, the job is fundamentally different. You're not in the action. You are orchestrating it. I called it a bunch of -tions, organization, motivation, communication. And I didn't like the job anywhere near as much. I was very gratified that I actually appeared to be pretty good at it. But my career was just, I continually went back to earlier stages. eBay grew, I went to PayPal, PayPal grew, I went to OpenTable, OpenTable grew... And there's a point at which the good news is I got pretty good at that stage of growth, consumer marketplace businesses at that stage of growth.The bad news is the learning curve just shallowed out like crazy. When I'm operating, I'm always on, always stressed, always tired. And then you throw on board on top of it and that was a pretty toxic combination. Patrick: Darcy told me to ask you for the story of how you got the job at OpenTable. Jeff: When I was 15, my dad died. If I was going to have gas money, I had to get a job. A friend of mine had just gotten a job at Joe Theismann's restaurant. I started there on weekends as a dishwasher and it turned out the chef who worked 13 shifts a week recognized that I was a little different than some of the other employees in the kitchen and he said, ""Hey, if you do these four things, I can come in a half hour later."" So I did the four things. Next day, next week, ""Yeah, if you do these eight things, I can come in an hour later."" Within a couple of months, I was brunch chef and it was funny because the general manager didn't work Sunday morning either. And so when this chef quit, the general manager goes, ""What am I going to do?"" And he goes, ""Well, Robert's cooking the nights and Jeff's cooking weekend.""He goes ""That 15 year old?"" And so he comes in and watches me like a lab rat the next Sunday like, ""Look, he can do that."" I ended up at the time making pretty good money for cooking. It was the only job I had till I graduated from college and I kept cooking after I graduated from college on weekends to make money. I ended up being an award winning chef. We won best brunch in Philadelphia. I do know it was one of the reasons I got into Stanford Business School because the head of admissions told me. And then after Benchmark had funded eBay and I worked closely with Bob Kagle, who's become a friend. And one point, I left eBay, I left PayPal, I'm unemployed. Benchmark had also invested in OpenTable. Gurley comes to a Monday meeting and says ""Good news, bad news on OpenTable. Good news is Thomas Layton says it's ready to go public. Bad news is Thomas Layton doesn't want to run a public company."" So Kagle just goes, ""Oh you should talk to Jeff. He knows network effects and he knows the restaurant business because he was a chef."" That was the OpenTable interview, essentially. Patrick: Incredible. And then what was that experience like taking it public and being that kind of first public CEO? Was that a completely different experience from some of the prior stuff and a whole different set of skills? Describe that experience. Jeff: It was surprisingly different to me. I'd run ebay.com and I'd run PayPal and PayPal was a very autonomous job. I'd worked for Meg forever and so we got into a cadence where I knew when I had to tell her certain kinds of news like, ""Hey, I might miss the quarter."" That needed to come early. But I'd sit down with her one-on-one maybe once a quarter so I had huge autonomy. Very interesting when you go from being a division head to a CEO, the level of worry and the level of final quality control check dials up like crazy. And so OpenTable is way smaller than PayPal, but I was more stressed because it's on me. Before it was on Meg, now it's on me. That was interesting. The second thing is I'd never done a financing before. I'd always joined companies that had finished their financing. My first financing was the OpenTable IPO at the depth of the financial crisis in May 2009. Patrick: You can really pick them. Jeff: The NASDAQ was off like 70% and we go public and it was the first venture backed tech company to go public in like two years. No pressure, no anything and my first financing. That was super interesting. We did a secondary after and so that was my introduction to the capital markets. Patrick: What do you think you did well in the financing looking back on it? Jeff: One was risk mitigation. We were one of the first, very small IPOs to go. When you're taking the risk of going out in a God awful market- Patrick: A shitstorm. Jeff: We didn't want to risk the company. I give a lot of credit to bankers on the deal. JD Moriarty and Harry Wagner at Allen. We ended up highly concentrating the offering into a handful of the best internet investors. Had a strong history of, if the company holds up their side of the deal, they'll buy and hold. They did large. This is Henry Ellenbogan who's at T. Rowe, Dennis Lynch and Sam Siani at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, Mark Casey at CapWorld, Will Danoff at Fidelity. They bought big. They wanted it in and they held for a good chunk of time, which makes very stable investor base and let me focus on running the business. Super mature. I'd go to Will, ""Hey, how do you want me to update you?"" He goes, ""I will dial into the conference calls."" It was like, ""Okay, that's great. If you have any questions, let me know. Do you want me to fly to Boston?"" ""No, not really."" That worked very, very well.",2163
130,Jeff Jordan - Building & Investing in Marketplaces,Lessons from the Transition from Operator to Investor," Patrick: There is an interesting question about the communication between company leaders and big investors. You've now been heavily on both sides of that equation. How idiosyncratic is success there or is there do you think a general standard that describes great when it comes to companies communicating with investors and vice versa? Jeff: I think it's the same with public and private essentially. On both sides of the table, treating the investor like an owner. The worst thing for me is when the operator's not talking to you about their real problems and their real concerns. I was told that I was pretty good at, ""Hey, this is going well."" ""Hey, this isn't going well. Here's our plan."" For me, it wasn't a sign of weakness. It was almost a sign of opportunity. OpenTable hadn't really figured out its international expansion. And it's just like, ""Hey, we haven't figure out internationally."" The opportunities X, here's where we're at, here's our approach. If we're successful, it'll be great. We're working hard. Treating the investor like an owner for me is a philosophy I try to use on both sides of the table. Patrick: You mentioned earlier the shape of the learning curve is probably very important to you and I'm sure that part of the motivation for going from the operating career into Andreessen Horowitz, which I recognize has a lot of operating elements too, is the constant learning curves that just gets steeper and steeper as you're working with new companies. But talk me through that transition from operator to investor, why you did it. What was notable about the early lessons learned at Andreessen 10 plus years ago? Jeff: You nailed it. It was seeking a new learning curve. In my spare time at PayPal and at OpenTable, I'd meet with entrepreneurs. That's actually how I met Alex Rampell. He was running TrialPay and reached out and I became a seed investor and advisor. I was enjoying that side hustle way more than I was enjoying my day job. I had a dozen seed investments I'd made. And I remember I got a call from one of the leading venture firms and that usually meant they wanted a CEO, they wanted a board member. And this time they said, ""Hey, we're looking for a GP."" And it's just like, ""Oh, I've never really thought about doing that."" I was intrigued because of the new learning curve. That firm had me interview one person at a time and they had about 50 partners every week. So it went on for like a year. And so while I was doing that, I remember I grabbed my good friend, John Donahoe, who I've known since business school and played hoops with, and were neighbors. And he's currently running Nike, I was running Bain at the time. And I said, ""You know me. I'm thinking of this change. What do you think?"" He's incredibly mature. He gave me great advice. A couple days later he calls me and he goes, ""You know Mark Andreesson's on my board, right? He asked me if I know anyone who'd make a good consumer investor.Do you want me to throw your name in the ring?"" It's like, ""Hell yeah."" I'm sitting down with Mark and Ben a couple weeks later. They framed a get to know you. They didn't know John had back-channeled with me. Pretty aware I'm being interviewed, but they're not calling it an interview. Kind of go, ""Well, a lot of CEOs are just heads down. A couple make one investment or sit on a board. Where are you on that spectrum?"" I go, ""Well, I've got about a dozen companies. Let me tell you about them."" Next question was, ""What is interesting out there?"" Probably 11 years ago. ""What's interesting out there that we should be going?"" I'd just seen Brian Chesky present Airbnb at Allen Conference, and I go, ""Airbnb."" And Mark looks at me quizzically and goes, ""You know they're raising, right?"" I go, ""No, I didn't know that."" So my first deal was partnering with Mark on Airbnb almost as I was walking in the door at Andreessen Horowitz. It was pretty funny. Patrick: What were some of the early surprising aspects of coming at it from the investor side? I'm especially interested in the pricing of rounds. I was told to ask you about pricing Instacart, for example. What lessons did you learn on the investing side that were completely new and different in those early years? Jeff: The good news is I was looking for a steep learning curve and it was way steeper than I thought. I was like, ""Wait, I'm in the same room. I'm just taking a different chair. How can it be that different?"" And man, is it different. Lesson one was it is a steep learning curve. Some of the early lessons, and still learning them, which is the interesting part, 10 years in. You have to continue to be adopting your decision framework. One was whenever I saw a bargain, I should run. It's a sign of no heat. Whenever I did a bargain, I regretted it later. Whenever I was forced to pay up, to date that has been a very good basket of companies. And you mentioned Instacart. I saw Instacart late when Apoorva was raising. I think he saw a blog I wrote on demand economy and just reached out. And he goes, ""Listen, really late process but we'd would love to talk you.""So we have this great conversation. And I think it was a Thursday or a Friday. And he goes, ""Listen, I have to decide by the end of the weekend. I'm getting so much pressure."" I crunch away on the weekend, digging into the details. I want to do it. I get okay for my partners to go in with a number. And I think it was I go in with something that's a 100x current GMV, like $90 million. And he goes, ""Jeff, I've really enjoyed our conversations. I'd really love to work with you, but you've got to know you're less than a third of any of my other term sheets. And by the way, I'm deciding tomorrow."" And so then do I want to play? If I want to play, I've got to triple. And so over a weekend... The interesting one, going back to your partners and saying, ""You know I asked for $90? I need $300."" that was a gut check, but there was so much to like about it. They're like, ""Okay, I'm going to climb the ladder."" I'm glad I climbed the ladder on it. A lot of the very best deals have that kind of pricing pressure, and the pricing's set by the market. It's not set by metrics. So you have to figure out, ""Okay, do you climb?"" And I tend to climb if I think it's legitimate heat. Patrick: Can you say a little bit about how much this rule holds up as you leave post product market fit and marketplaces? So Instacart was series B. It was working to some extent. And I understand how a marketplace which has begun to work, which will thrive on a pure network effect, is the ultimate business. So paying up at least makes some sense. What about if you go pre-product market fit or away from the marketplace network effect-driven business model, do you think that concept changes of avoid bargains and be one to overpay? Jeff: I don't know. You could look at my career in tech and it's almost a one trick pony. I look for companies that have the potential for a network effect. I typically look for companies that have potential for a network effect, often through a digital marketplace dynamic. One of the most important lessons for me, another lesson learned, in the areas I invest in, which is largely consumer, I think it's critical you have a theory and defensibility. And for me, that defensibility typically has been network effect. I've done a few where it's scale, a few where it's something different, but the theory. So there are these incredibly attractive opportunities. Early on, mattress in a box. Companies go $100 million in about eight minutes. Tiles to find things, $100 million in seven minutes. Meal kits, $100 million in six minutes. And so you're looking at these growth charts vertical, and you just say, ""Look at that, isn't that attractive? It's what do you want, growth."" But then you say, ""What happens when there's six mattress in a box companies and six..."" I learned very early. I did D2C before it was called D2C. I had a decent portfolio but there was no defensibility characteristics in it at all so I stopped doing DTC like seven, eight years ago. And so I try to abide by that rule, and that rule has served me pretty well. The one it didn't, ironically, was DoorDash. That's probably my biggest miss. And I had an opportunity to do I think was a B... Tony clearly has been kick-ass on it. Patrick: He's awesome. Jeff: Ironically I met him. Stanford Business School asked me to sit down with some of their entrepreneurs 10 years ago. And one they sent in was Tony Xu with Palo Alto Eat. And so I spent half hour with the guy. And by the way, he's delivering the meals after classes over personally. It was that early. So I knew him. And I just looked at that market. And you got Uber, Caviar, OrderAhead. There were 15 of them. And you're like, ""Okay, I envision a future where you go into Oran's Hummus and they have 15 iPads or chip-printers all spinning out orders. And how do you make money in that environment?"" Well, you cap Travis. Market dries up and Tony executes phenomenally. That for me is the biggest exception to my rule. Need that theory of sensibility in a marketplace business. And kudos to Tony, it's awesome performance.",2226
131,Jeff Jordan - Building & Investing in Marketplaces,Managing Healthy Tensions Between Stakeholders," Patrick: As you start to dig on the layers of what's driving marketplace businesses, consumer ones specifically, what tensions are healthy? There's a lot of stakeholders in marketplaces, and not everyone can get the best of everything all the time. How do you like to look and investigate tensions inside of a network? Jeff: Tensions are great because there's two sides or three sides, and there's always tensions. It started at eBay. The sellers paid us, and so the obvious thing, give the sellers what they want. But it turned out for me, what made eBay work was the buyers. Amazon and Yahoo both launched auction products early at eBay. By the way, they were the gorillas at the time. Particularly Yahoo. It was a $100 billion dollar market cap early. They launch auctions, they make it free. We charged a list. They made it free. Amazon made it free. And they quickly got millions of listings, but what they lacked were buyers. And so the sellers went there and it was like they put up billboards and no one walked by. And so they came running back to eBay and redoubled, their efforts on our platform. Long had the philosophy that why the sellers came is we had a robust buyer base, and so then growing the business requires optimizing the buyers' base.And so eBay and OpenTable, we did things that the sellers, the business side didn't like. They viewed reviews on OpenTable. At OpenTable. I have four web windows open. I have the one for OpenTable, I have one for our map because we didn't have a map. I had one for Zagat and Yelp because there were no reviews. And you're like, ""Okay, I think I see the path forward here, provide an integrated experience."" So we go to the restaurant and say, ""Yeah, we're going to debut reviews."" And they go, ""You cannot publish a negative review from a customer I don't know. You're my technology provider. What are you doing?"" Kind of thing. And you're just like, ""We did research. If a customer opened a review, they were twice as likely to make a reservation.""You're working with them. And then finally if we couldn't convince them, we gave them the ability to opt out. ""We will not show reviews on your page if you don't want it. Just know that every other restaurant's going to have reviews and you're going to look pretty stupid."" So there are always those tensions. I almost always bias towards the buyer side of the equation. People come to Airbnb, hosts come to Airbnb because it has the largest guest network in the world. The more guests you have, the happier the host will be in the long term. You're kind of optimizing for buyers, for diners, for guests, and in spite of the fact that the other side's typically the one paying you, do Patrick: Do you have good examples of when the supply side is actually the harder side of the network? I remember talking to Gurley about this and saying, ""Usually if you get all the buyers, the supply will show up."" But I'm sure there's some examples where it's different. Jeff: Airbnb's been supply constrained almost since I got involved in the company. The supply's expanding, but they believe they'd do more business if they had more supply, high quality supply. So it is interesting. Particularly in the unconventional businesses... I've said this probably. The first time I heard the Airbnb concept I said, ""That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard."" Patrick: So many, yeah. Jeff: I'm intensely private. I don't want someone on my house, a stranger in my house. I don't want to be in a stranger's house. It was just like, ""Oh."" When it's that counterintuitive, the supply side, evangelical people to kind of say, ""I see it, and I enjoy it."" And Airbnb was part economic empowerment but also part human relationships. They're people who like meeting strangers and talking to them and learning about them and figuring out... There are multiple satisfactions involved in that experience. But there are a lot of marketplaces, particularly the weird ones, that can definitely use more supply. Patrick: What do you think are the characteristics of founders that are most important in marketplaces specifically, maybe relative to a enterprise SaaS business or something? Jeff: We specialize a lot in into verticals. We have a crypto fund and a bio fund and a growth fund. But even within the venture fund we have a consumer vertical, a FinTech vertical, and an enterprise vertical. The entrepreneurs, you could pick everyone. Anonymous person walks in the door, FinTech. Anonymous person walks in the door, enterprise. Typically what the consumer founder is, typically they're really young, they're digital natives, and they've made observations about the state of the digital world that typically more senior workers with more experience don't make.So almost all of my strong entrepreneurs, the ones who've really broken out, they almost didn't have a job before they started the company. I think Brian worked a year or two as a designer at a firm in LA. Ben Silbermann had a couple years at Google as a PM. Apoorva had a couple years at Amazon as an engineer. This one came home to me, not investment I did directly, but in my hiatus between PayPal and OpenTable I got an outreach from a young man named Mark Zuckerberg who was running 'The Facebook' and had just relocated to California. And I was like, ""Okay, I'm intrigued. I've heard of this thing. It's supposed to be really cool."" So I go meet with him and then we have tea on University Avenue, to tell you how long ago it was, because he can't do that anymore.And I said, ""Why'd you reach out?"" He goes, ""Well, Sean Parker told me to. He said you're one of the better operators in the Valley."" And I'm like, ""Okay, major street cred."" Sean Parker's recommending me around. ""What he's sitting down for."" He goes, ""Well, people who know me know that I've never run a business before."" I go, ""Okay, got that. Yeah."" ""People who know me may not know that I never worked at a business before."" And you're kind of like, ""Never? You don't know pay bands and OKRs and all the arcane knowledge that comes from being an employee?"" He's like, ""Nope, none of it.""All of the best entrepreneurs I've met, just go to school. Mark clearly was doing it. He's reached out to me. He was reaching out to other people. Brian Chesky has a kitchen cabinet of like a dozen people who are world-class in their area of expertise that he pings with. John Dano happened to be one managing armies. John Ivy happened to be one on design. John Ivy is- Patrick: Pretty good. Jeff: Yeah, you're doing okay. Ben Silverman, once we went to Sun Valley together, the Allen and Company conference. And we're flying back. I go, ""How was your conference?"" I always make sure I disappeared at some point and mountain biked just because I can't do constant socializing. And he goes, ""I had 51 meetings with different people at the conference."" And I go, ""What the hell? And you're not fundraising. What'd you do?"" He goes, ""Everyone there has some special power and I wanted to know what they are."" And so he invested 26 hours or something like that into self-improvement during an investor conference. And it's just that mentality. If you find entrepreneurs with that kind of hunger and thirst. ""I want to get better. I know I need to get better. I'm going to invest time and get better."" It's a pretty good attribute. Patrick: I'm kind of blown away by watching Brian Chesky from afar. I don't know Brian. And recently he did an interesting thing on Twitter for the most recent Airbnb quarterly results, which was just so clearly in tune with how information for a business like that should get disseminated, and also so succinct and concise around the things that probably really matter. And you already said it before. You go from being a contributor to a coach to a focus on the shuns or whatever. Is that it? Is the people that can do that, that can both start something from scratch but also manage a huge business, is it just about that perpetual learning gene? Is that the primary thing that matters? Jeff: I think that's a lot of it. For me, that's something I definitely try to assess. Do they know it? And you have really frank conversations with the entrepreneurs because my partner Ben wrote about the imposter syndrome. We all have had the imposter syndrome. I've had it as an operator. I've had it as an investor. It's just kind of like, ""What am I doing here? I'm in this room and trying to figure it out."" The other thing is every one of the founders of the businesses that took off has superpowers of some kind. Now, they're often the superpowers are overdeveloped and the non-superpowers are underdeveloped. And so there are always gaps as well. The ones who really figure it out lean into their superpower and then supplement them with their team and the areas that they may not be yet.So one of Brian's superpower is branding communication. He is just world class at that. I've learned so much from watching him develop the brand positioning for Airbnb. And it took him like a half decade to get it right, but when he got it right it was like a Eureka moment for me. Like, ""Oh I get it now."" And that ended up in the couple campaigns. ""Live like a local, belong anywhere,"" that it wasn't just accommodation. It wasn't economics. It wasn't this. It was that- Patrick: It's like lifestyle, yeah. Jeff: ... human connection and live like a local. You're not in FiDi in a sterile hotel. You're in the mission. Aroma's wafting into your Airbnb. You're living like a local. Each one of the founders have a superpower, and good ones figure out how to lean into it and how to supplement with the areas that are less so.",2314
132,Jeff Jordan - Building & Investing in Marketplaces,When to Focus on Economics and Margins," Patrick: How far into the evolution of one of these marketplaces do you think it's really important to start honing in on, I guess I'll call it unit economics or margins, or something like on DoorDash or something? For a long time it was, ""Well look, at scale these will be amazing."" And it's kind of nebulous, what scale meant and when that would be. How much do you think about maybe the margin profile of a marketplace as you're investing, especially if it's early on? Jeff: I don't not look at it if the margin's not bad. An extreme case of this was Instacart. The time we invested, he was earning something like $12 a order in money to Instacart, and he was spending about $30. And so- Patrick: That's a pretty bad margin. Jeff: That was pretty bad. And so the work I did that weekend was around profitability. And it turned out that he was just starting to do deals with grocery stores where the grocers would give him better pricing and share some of the incremental revenue from the economics. And that, at scale, would dramatically improve his economics. So one is you had to believe he'd get to the deals with the grocers. And then could he get to price parity? And he laid out this waterfall of, ""This is how I'm going to make money."" And it was very detailed. Apoorva's superpower is optimization. He's just said, ""These are the 19 things we need to accomplish to make the unit economics work. And I'm halfway on this one and just laid it out."" And I haven't looked at that sheet in a while, but it largely came true. He made the unit economics work.The big swing was he got the deals with the grocers and then the advertising business, I think Fiji, just announced it would be over $1 billion this year. Amazon showed that's very high margin income. So the existence of that ad business means he can provide a very compelling value prop to the consumer because they don't have to pay the full fare for the delivery. They get it partially subsidized through the advertising venue. And so that's been key to the working, but the economics were awful when we invested. And so the leap of faith there wasn't people would want groceries delivered to their homes. The leap of faith was he can make the economics work. Patrick: It seems like so much of what drives the success of these models is buyer convenience. I guess just convenience in general for digital users is just always a powerful force. As you think about convenience, when does what typically starts as a horizontal opportunity like eBay tip into something like a Goat or a StockX that's much more vertically focused in terms of what is being bought and sold on the marketplace to increase convenience for the buyer? Tell me a little bit about that flip and that line between horizontal and vertical marketplaces, and what you've learned there. Jeff: It was really interesting. Early on at eBay, first you're worried about, ""Okay, someone's going to build Amazon Auctions, Yahoo Auctions."" We quickly figured out that wasn't going to happen. We had enough of a lead in that marketplace business. We had the buyers, we were pretty good. Came to believe that there were two threats to what then was a pretty strong monopoly. One threat was we get hollowed out vertical by vertical by specialized marketplaces, because one of the benefits of the horizontal marketplace is the consumer can go to anywhere they want and find what they're looking for. One of the negatives is it's really hard to tailor the experience to the unique attributes of that vertical. So we'd spend a lot of time trying to figure out, ""Okay, how do I go part way? Have enough tailoring that it's helpful to user experience, the horizontal platform remains coherent.""If you dropped into tickets, this doesn't work like collectibles. ""How do I buy this? I can't figure it out."" There had to be that consistency of user experience. So we were worried about getting hollowed out, one. Two was a completely orthogonal approach to the marketplace. I always say, ""You're not going to see the person catching you in the rear view mirror, you have to look in the side mirrors because they're going to come from an angle."" And my read on what happened to eBay was two things. One is eBay, early on, I used to say was everything you couldn't find in a mall. You could buy on eBay anything you could not find in a mall, and Amazon was everything you could find in a mall. What happened? One was Google became, ""Okay, we're going to help you find anything in the world."" And that became an alternative to buying on eBay. You could Google something and find sellers that would have it.And the sellers actually liked having a Google transaction more than an eBay transaction because they owned the user. They then have the ability to directly remarket to that user, where on eBay we controlled that relationship. So even though eBay was cheaper on a transaction basis, Google was a preferred destination. And I was at a Intuit management conference where I spoke right before Cheryl Sandberg spoke. I hung around to hear Cheryl's story. And she goes, ""Oh, we knew early on that our main competitor was eBay."" And I'm just sitting there like, ""Holy cow."" That was not what I expected to come out of her mouth. I expected Yahoo or something. Some search engine. No, it's eBay because of the commerce angle. So eBay got hurt, I think a lot, by Google. And then we knew Amazon was going to launch a marketplace.Actually my relationship with Josh Kopelman, First Round Capital, started when he had started Half.com. Josh, among other things, he was great at getting publicity. So he bought out a town in Oregon that was called Halfway, Oregon, and gave them two computers and a couple thousand dollars and they renamed themselves Half.com, Oregon. So brilliant. And then he registered the URL Ebazon, because Half was a hybrid between eBay and Amazon. He did a really nice hack where all items were listed under a UPC code, which meant it looked like an Amazon. If you look at Amazon Marketplace and click to other sellers, that is what Half is. And I've been told by sources that Amazon, in building Marketplace, had called it the Half-killer. So eBay bought Half but then Amazon knocked it off. And so that then became the other key competitor that we faced.But you need something extraordinary like that to lose a network effect, which eBay clearly has done. So I actually read an interview with Jamie Iannone, the head of eBay now, who worked on my team back in the day. And he's trying to get a much better vertical approach. He's now authenticating sneakers and trading cards and things like that, trying to improve the vertical competitiveness because, for example, in shoes, go in StockX. Done a heck of a job. They were at the top of our marketplace 100 list that we recently put out. And that's two players in one small vertical on eBay who built really big businesses and StubHub was another that built a really big business in competition with eBay. So it's a really traditional trade off on, you might not be able to replicate the horizontal, but can you rip out verticals?",1605
133,Jeff Jordan - Building & Investing in Marketplaces,Layers of Growth and Future Areas of Innovation," Patrick: I'm curious what big categories you are surprised have not yet been marketplaced or something. You've written about jobs marketplaces like RigUp is a good example, where you're an investor or a 16th seasoned investor. What has not been solved? What should have a marketplace that doesn't yet, and why? Jeff: There are three industry, three segments I've been looking at since I've been a venture capitalist and still, I'm not sure I've yet found the salt. I mean, there are three of the key remaining businesses on Craigslist. One is rentals. So I've got to play there belong, which is doing a very nice business, but my kids still use Craigslist as the primary way to find places to rent. And it's a terrible experience. Half the things on there are already rented. There's no information, but Craigslist has a network effect and that one hasn't ripped up. So one is rentals. Two is blue collar jobs.There is no good site right now for blue collar jobs. Again, it lives largely on Craigslist. If you run a restaurant, you're running Craigslist ads trying to find, and there's again, terrible user experience, puts all the effort on the hiring manager. And then the third is the service sector, home services in some kind. Thumbtacks making a good play, trying to flip from lead gen into a marketplace. I respect Marco a lot as an operator, but I don't think the definitive marketplace has yet been built there. And so those three segments are three that our team will meet all day long with entrepreneurs looking because someone's going to crack it. It's a question of when. Patrick: What do you think are keys to if the unit being considered in the marketplace is a job. What are the key aspects of the business, the product, what is unique about if it's job specific as the marketplace that matters? Jeff: We've got one job marketplace, but it's not blue collar, it's healthcare. Incredible health is a marketplace for currently hiring nurses. Is a good example of LinkedIn does not work for nurses. I mean, because what's important to nurses is all your licensing and your qualifications and your experience. And it's a set of very unique attributes that again, LinkedIn as a horizontal platform can't do. So incredible health is a vertical play trying to do healthcare well, healthcare hiring well and rip it out. I mean blue collar is the same kind of thing. LinkedIn does not do it well, indeed. And the job boards are not particularly great. There should be a marketplace approach onto it. And so lots of people are aiming at it and hopefully someone catches fire soon. Patrick: When you think about the companies that have or are, or did work, you've got this great concept of layers of growth, sort of like a layer cake in terms of how the businesses start to evolve and how you plant seeds early on for chapters of growth and maybe some distant point in the future. Talk to me about this concept of layers of growth inside a business and why you're interested in it. Jeff: I quickly became convinced early on at eBay that the key way to grow these businesses was product enhancements. Giving users additional use cases, functionality, take away friction, do whatever you can. Auctions was a very good business on eBay. When I took over eBay was 100% auctions on ebay.com. One of the reasons they divisionalized was to go global, keep the focus on ebay.com. And so how we grew eBay early on is the first one. And most controversial at the time was we introduced a fixed price format that we sat into an auction format and many in the community were convinced we're going to kill the golden goose by trying to intermingle auction, which are great for looking for price discovery versus the same item might be listed for a fixed price somewhere else.They worried the magic was going to go away. So we figured out, okay, how can we make the two coexist? There were different audiences that preferred the different formats. There were different types of goods that trended towards the different formats. And so that accelerated growth pretty dramatically when we got fixed price right. We layered on stores. Another big one was we layered on payments. When I arrived at eBay, you'd win an auction. And then the buyer and the seller would negotiate shipping rates because if you don't know where you're shipping to, you can't preset rates. You go back and forth, ""Oh, I live in Northern California."" Oh, you want it in two days or nine days? I'll take nine days. And so, okay, shipping is $5. Then the way you paid is you went to either the bank or the post office, got a money order and mailed it to the seller. The seller waits till they get the money order and then would go to the post office and ship it back. Weeks would elapse. I mean, the two weeks was kind of the standard and a whole bunch of friction. Imagine buying a $10 trading card and needing- Patrick: To go to the bank and get the currency. Jeff: And then go to the post office because you have to mail it. There's a book about the founding of PayPal that I just finished reading. It was really fun because it took you through all the play by play at the time. eBay had bought a company called Billpoint when I was joining the company. And early on, I was supposed to be running it. Meg said, ""Oh yes, you're running services and that's a service."" And so he then had managed to circumvent my layer and continue to report directly to Meg, which in retrospect's really the best thing that ever happened in my career because Billpoint became absolute roadkill to PayPal.The PayPal guys did a phenomenal job and the eBay people did not. Layering in electronic payments, and the ability to pay in two minutes took the transaction from hellishly hard to pretty darn easy. And that then, we built a payment business on top of eBay after we bought PayPal, but much more, it helped accelerate the eBay marketplace because it took huge amounts of friction away. Each of those product improvements accelerated growth. The book makes the point. Early on eBay was kicking Amazon's butt early on. It tells you only the paranoid survive is probably the long term lesson from Andy Grove. At that point it was the product innovation that was fueling the growth and the energy. Patrick: It also is interesting to think about the fact that people were willing to do all that crap to buy something. Shows you how much real innovation there was. There wasn't an alternative. Jeff: The person who made the eBay investment was Bob Kagle. If memory serves me right from Michigan, that I do know, and he collected duck decoys from an artist named Oscar Peterson. And the only reason I remember that because of the pianist, but it's... And when Pierre went in with his Auction Web website, which also had Area 41 and Ebla on related pages on the same site. Bob looking black and white types in Oscar Peterson. He's used to driving all over Michigan trying to unearth a duck decoy and all of a sudden five pop up on eBay. That was the eureka moment where he said, ""Oh my God, I don't have to drive around Michigan all summer."" Patrick: I'm willing to drive to the bank. Jeff: So yeah, kudos to him. And by the way, eBay never even used Bob's check. They always had the money in the bank. It was just security money. It's one of the best venture investments of all time. Patrick: It's amazing to think about that initial innovation and I guess that's what you really would be hunting for as an investor. But then it sounds like the layers of growth playbook that you've laid out is really just respecting that friction and convenience preference for the user that you do have, just constantly be trying to get ahead of that, and you'll probably do well. And that's the paranoia. Jeff: You'll do really well. Also, the use cases. eBay, when Jeff Skoll wrote the original business plan, it was all about collectibles. He anticipated building a business on collectibles and antiques. That definitely was the early 10 poles, but then other people started using eBay for other reasons. It was great for overstock merchandise. So you could get new inbox merchandise at a steel because it didn't sell in the stores. And they're trying to move the excess inventory. Hard to find things. Things were the hot Christmas present. Every year, something blew up on eBay. I need the new PlayStation console. We would sell 80% of the units that Microsoft produced would sell on eBay during a Christmas season.So all these new use cases came up and then enabling them, making the discoverable, creating awareness. That was also a massive growth vector. And Airbnb's done a little bit of this with their experience business. It's a new layer. It sits adjacent to trips. Most trips you want to do something when you get there. That's another example of the company just saying, ""Okay, adjacent opportunity, same transaction. Can we grow this business?"" Patrick: I don't think we've mentioned the business, which I believe was your first IPO exit, which is Pinterest. I bring it up... I remember Sarah Tavel at Benchmark talking to me about the feeling around of product market fit at Pinterest and trying to figure out just like a lot of pushing, pulling one step back, two steps forward, all this movement. What did you learn about and from Pinterest as a unique business model in contrast to eBay where the joke is the second employee's job is opening up checks. It just sort of worked instantly. Pinterest was different. So what do you take away from that experience? Jeff: I had the luxury of avoiding those three years when Ben was walking through the desert. I gave Jeremy and Bessemer big kudos for investing early and find that. But the big one is there's all the revisionist stories on, oh, it just worked, and things like that. On a ton of them, they had to flail for product market fit. Pinterest was clearly one of those. Airbnb was clearly one of those. The Airbnb book chronicles all the weird things they did, including a serial box, selling serial boxes of Republican and Democratic Convention to make money called Obama O's and Captain McCains, and then collectibles. But they literally sold real cereal boxes- Patrick: As a revenue source. Jeff: As a revenue source. It is that creativity, that trying different things. Ben tried different communities. Early influencers actually ended up being an important part of their, before they were called influencers. I give these entrepreneurs just unbelievable credit for wandering through the desert drilling holes and looking for water. Sometimes they find it and then Pinterest would be a great example that bends persistence. And you tried 49 different things. The 50th work.",2453
134,Jeff Jordan - Building & Investing in Marketplaces,Building Andreesen Horowitz," Patrick: If you think about the transition to building Andreessen the business. So obviously we've talked a ton about your very clear focus on consumer marketplaces and one key business model, which happens to benefit from network effects when it works. So turns out okay and very defensible. Andreessen the business is very different. And when I had Marc on, we talked about this HP 2.0 concept. You're one of the first partners there. I know you've also had a hand as a player coach and also thinking about building the business itself. Talk me through your angle on all of this, of what is unique and interesting about Andreessen Horowitz, the business and how it's doing things differently than the traditional very partnership driven venture model. Jeff: Marc may have mentioned this. A lot of the influence was actually Michael Ovitz who built CAA from nothing into the most powerful man in Hollywood kind of thing. What he did is he went into an industry that was largely a loose conglomeration of individual partners who had their own book of business and their own relationships and just turned it on its head and built out a set of expertise that benefited the talent so that the talent's relationship was more with the firm than it was within individuals. And another talent firm, William Morris, you walked in, you'd had the relationship with Jimmy and you know Jimmy for 20 years. You walk into the conference room at CAA, there'd be a dozen people in there. It's domestic distribution, international distribution, publishing, music. And there were the experts in each one. So Marc and men kind of applied that logic early on and said, ""Okay, we're entrepreneurs, what do we lack?""We lack some guidance and definitely lack networks. When Zuckerberg came out here, he had no network. He had to ask Sean for introductions to meet interesting people and things like that. The biggest innovations when I joined were one, they had old operating people like me as the early founders. And then two, is they systematically build out networks that help the founders and that model works well. It's created a lot of value to the entrepreneurs and the good news is the entrepreneurs talk. The prominent entrepreneurs say, ""This model does work."" You check it out. I think that's been good. The other thing that I think has emerged over time and I give Ben a lot of credit on this is Ben wrote out a firm culture early on and we really integrated it into the day to day operations of the firm in a pretty meaningful way.And the culture has things like we do first class business in the first class way. We play to win. We're stronger in our diversity. We respect the entrepreneurial process and we live those values. And as a result, you typically get a very consistent user experience at Andreesen Horowitz where anyone will help sort of another important one is we win as a team. Anyone at the firm will help any entrepreneur at any time. We all have our individual superpowers. Andrew's great at growth. Alex is smart as shit. Knows FinTech better than anyone else- Patrick: Smart as shit. Jeff: ... in the world. Ben is great on management. I'm pretty good on marketplaces. And so we win as a team. You get the firm. I think that people feel that energy and that commitment to the entrepreneurial process. Helping people be successful is value one that's emerged over time. Value two is we're former operators. So we try a lot of things. Some work, some don't, but it's always moving and you're getting a firm and we're making the firm better every year. We're seeking to exploit our advantage.I think we're now a little over 350 employees at Andreesen Horowitz. That's probably more than our 10 biggest competitors in the US combined. We're making that investment out of partner fees, which other firms would take as direct income. We have an alignment of interest between our LPs, our companies and us. We all do well if our companies do well. That investment is designed to help our companies perform and maximize their potential in support of what the entrepreneurs are doing. And it's been a pretty good model. Patrick: There's a really interesting aspect of scaling the business, which is having to find, recruit and win and then keep talented general partner investors. That's an exercise kind of like finding founders, I'm sure with different things you're looking for. What have you learned about that process? And I'm interested in all aspects of it, not just identifying them, but also successfully recruiting them. Like what are the lessons there? Jeff: It's really hard. And it's the core of the business. Each of our fun families knock on wood so far are working. That means that the people who are running them, the partners who are running them are running them effectively. But we did have a not perfect hit recorder early on, as we were trying to figure it out. It turns out the old operator has a couple issues with it. One is it's a young person's business and that really comes through particularly in networks. I have a very good network in Silicon Valley. I'm very typical and that I'm still investing at my age, but my network is of my peers and they're not starting businesses anymore. Scott Cook at Intuit is not going to put on the shoes again and kick it up again. You want people who are immersed in the network and are the up and comers coming.So they really relaxed, long operating experience thing. The other reason we relaxed it is it leads you right into white males because they only heard people had opportunities 20 years ago to run businesses were largely white males. So we wanted to get better diversity in the partnership and relax in that requirement also help with that. We got young people who are in the flow, in the networks and can be more diverse. There wasn't an archaic rule before. That is the key to the business is finding great investors who fit with the culture and the big one there is teamwork. We over me, we knock wood managed to keep that as a core value in the firm, and if we can continue to scale that's really positive for the future. Patrick: So much of the entire conversation is networks, networks and people, network effects, cultivating networks, et cetera, being in the flow. You mentioned earlier, maybe skew introverted or whatever. But one of the things that in preparing for the conversation I heard a lot from founders and other investors was that you're very good at convening people. The morning basketball game is something that I'm really interested in. Maybe tell that story just as an example of the power of convening and what you've learned about doing that well. Jeff: That's a little personal passion project. I've played basketball forever. I'm pretty weird. I'm still playing at my age. My game is not improving these days. About 20 years ago, I took over organizing a game on the Stanford. Played twice a week on the Stanford campus. Gave me an opportunity to play, but it also gave me an opportunity to build a community of people on the number one rule is no assholes. Number two rule is we don't want to get hurt. I was responsible for 20 years for keeping the game alive, bringing in new blood, keeping the quality really high and it's turned out and I haven't heard of any other game in the Bay Area that rivals it. It's been featured in the ringer, and it's featured on this TV show, Silicon Valley. It's kind of fun, but I get inbound hero. I got two this week of people saying like, ""Hey, I played at Arizona. I'm looking for a local brand. Can I get into your game?""We built a community and it's turned in that the ringer story caught it pretty well. It's turned into a real community. I mean, people have each other's backs. There's a lot of mentoring going on. There's a huge age range and people, there are a couple people like me, Joe Lacob plays, lead owner of The Warriors, couple others like that. But most of the game are former D1 Athletes who are pretty young, pretty mercifully recruit out the Stanford Football program. There's probably 10 people in the game running there and they're early in their career. And what's great to see is people further along in their career, helping earlier in their career, figure out, get the first job, grow. And so a whole lot of my mentoring comes out of that community where people I know and care for and respect are looking for the opportunities. The good news is we've broken the gender gap. We've got a number of women who play in the community and are great members and have the same discussions and conversations there. So for me, the main reason I play now is I don't want to leave that community behind. I've been immersed in it for 20 years. It's a whole bunch of really good people that I really care about and respect. At some point, I'm going to have to hang up the shoes. I keep trying to delay that as long as I can. Patrick: It's a long lived story, 20 plus years of a community strengthening, and everyone wants that. But oftentimes like a business or something, there are things that are hard to do that are required for the strength of a community. Looking back on you managing that, what were those things like? What was the hard things that you had to do or things that were difficult or whatever that were nonetheless for the right decisions? Jeff: You had to finesse people into the game because there's a famous adage among hoopsters that you can really get someone's personality on the basketball court. Craig Robinson played basketball with Barack Obama to try to assess his character when he was dating Michelle. You figure out a pretext where, hey, we have an open space today. Do you want to run? And then you're basically assessing them both current level, but much more for no asshole rule. It's one of the runs where people play a team game. It's not rundown and hoisted. It's set picks, play defense. That's why the D1 players like it, because it's real basketball, not jungle ball. That was challenge one.People stop playing, so you have to have new blood and you do that well. The other is enforcing the mores. One former NFL player who has a pretty good temper scared the shit out of one of these 6'4, 200 pound guys. And so I get the very fun conversation to go up to said hothead and say, ""Dude, you can't do that. So if you want to play, you got to dial that down."" Guy outweighs me by 85 pounds. If you run businesses, you get pretty good at having the tough conversations. There's an investment of time and investment of the payoffs are huge. It's such a good group of folks.",2381
135,Jeff Jordan - Building & Investing in Marketplaces,Finding Purpose in Mentorship," Patrick: You've had a crazy cool set of people that you've worked with from like women to Pierre, to Marc and Ben, to John Donahue, crazy kind of murders row of talented people. So I'm sure you've been on the receiving end of a lot of mentorship. And now you're talking about going it out. Both on the receiving and the giving end of mentorship, what makes it valuable to you? Who does it well, what does great mean in mentorship relationships? What have you learned there? Jeff: I'm passionate about it because I benefited enormously and a friend gave me a practice that I've been trying to implement with modest success. There are three or four people who kept me from driving into a ditch. I lost my father in my teens, my mother in my 20s. And there are people who took disproportionate interest in me and who were formative in my life. Ms. Mask at a high school, Rick Secchia at an insurance company, Cigna. It was Kathy Gwynn at Stanford Business School.I mean, these people just went out of their way to throw me on the right path by when I was doing it. But the timeline is now is completely pay it forward. I don't think I'd be where I am and have the opportunities I had if it wasn't for these people. And if I can be that person for someone going forward, it's honoring what they did for me. I don't have much spare time. I put a lot of it into trying to help people that impress me who might not have the same obvious opportunity and it's completely pay it forward. When they ask, how can I thank you? It's like do the same thing. Patrick: Do it to someone else. Jeff: Yeah, and just pay it forward. The satisfactions are high. The frustration is I haven't figured out how to scale it. It is still one at a time. The good news is, there's a lot of the people who I think I positively touched, and that's great satisfaction. I still haven't cracked the code. And how do you do it at scale? How do you have the bigger impact and doing it one at a time? And it's a one at a time thing. If you have an ideas, let me know. Patrick: When you're doing this, what are you trying to accomplish for the person? Jeff: Getting them started, that's it. My kids are 27. They had great education. They both went to Stanford and they come out and they have no idea what they want to do. How do you find it? And by the way, for me, it's a journey. It took me 15 years to find Silicon Valley and technology. And I found my life's calling after a whole lot of looking. And so it's implausible that someone come out and figures it out on step one. The conversation always starts with, ""Oh, I'm now out of school, and they tell me I have to get a job. What do I do?"" And then you're just working with them on, okay, you're trying to figure out what their interests are. You're trying to figure out assets they have, what networks are they in? A lot of the people I work with are former Stanford athletes. Being an elite Stanford athlete means you pretty much couldn't get an internship because you have to work on your exercise every summer.So you're starting out with these exploration conversations of, ""Jeff, have you ever had a job?"" ""Not really. I've been pursuing academics and athletics at the elite levels for years."" And so then how do you help them figure out, ""Okay, what do I like to do? Where's my skill? Where's my interest level?"" And then typically if you can get them their first job, they can figure it out from there. They're launched, and then they progressively optimize and things like that. If I can help them launch, very high satisfaction for them. Patrick: I'm always interested in OnRamp, since it's yet another version of building or being an OnRamp is a powerful thing. Jeff: I'll be a reference or something when they're going for their second or third job, but all the effort is get them started, get them in the flow. Patrick: Jeff, it's been such a fun, cool conversation. Definitely you have one of the most interesting set of experiences of people that I've had on the show. Almost perfectly split down the operator investor sides of the equation. Obviously all in one kind of business model, but nonetheless, totally fascinating set of lessons. I ask everybody the same traditional closing question. What is the kindest thing that anyone's ever done for you? And you've already listed the names of some of those people that have helped you along the way. Jeff: The people who saw something in me that made them want to, as strangers usually, invest time in going, it's just remarkable. It was the parents of friends, it was my boss, it was the head of admissions. It's just all these people who... I told the head of admissions I couldn't afford to go to Stanford Business School. I was on my own working two jobs, the insurance job during the week and the restaurant during the weekend. And then I was in Philadelphia, and you're asking me to go California and take on $70,000 in debt, I can't do it. And she called me back the next day and goes, ""I couldn't sleep at night. You have to come. We'll figure it out. You'll be out of debt in two years."" That's like, ""I have to come?"" And she talked me into coming, and it was a very good decision in retrospect for me at that time. It was remarkable generosity, and hopefully I can pay it back. Patrick: One more question as a follow-up. You mentioned losing your parents, both, at a young age, what did you most learn from each of them, from your mom and from your dad? Jeff: My dad was really smart. He was at Harvard at like 15 or something like that. I think they asked him to age a little bit before they let him come back. And my mom just had credible level of ambition, frankly, for us kids. And that combination, I think, is... I'm nowhere as smart as my dad or my brother. I was a pretty good student and learned pretty well. And then I think my mother gave me the drive. I know a couple very high performing execs who were essentially orphans by the time they were in their 20s. You get drive, if you're on your own and there's no backstop, it's pretty good for providing motivation. Patrick: Well, this was really wonderful, Jeff. I so appreciate the time. Can't wait to dive into some of these ideas and companies. Thanks for your time. Jeff: I enjoyed it. Thank you. Pleasure.This site uses cookies to improve your browsing experience.

136,Eric Glyman - Reimagining Corporate Finance,Introduction," Patrick: My guest today is Eric Glyman, co-founder and CEO of Ramp. Ramp is best known for its corporate cards, but it has a range of software products to help finance teams save time and money. The business has grown rapidly since its founding in 2019 and was last valued at $8 billion. Eric and I discussed Ramp's initial marketing wedge, how the business has dealt with such fast growth, and why they hold Stablecoins on their balance sheet. Please enjoy my conversation with Eric Glyman.",115
137,Eric Glyman - Reimagining Corporate Finance,The Inspiration Behind Ramp," Patrick: Eric, I'd love to begin our conversation by hearing what this industry that you're building in was like when you first approached it. What were the things, looking back on the early days, that were most notably awry about the existing incumbent solutions that motivated you to want to build a company here in the first place? Eric: Happy to go into it right away. I mean, so Ramp is a relatively young company and it's stark how quickly things have changed. We incorporated in March of 2019, and I think the theme of not just the year, the day, the decade, frankly, was one of excess. The way to compete in the credit card industry, which is our first flagship product, was buy our card. We've got amazing signup bonuses. We might have great lounges for you too. We've got points and rewards. We understand you uniquely. It was very marketing forward. It was very centered around EO excess, metal cards, black cards, all these kind of things. It was very much the idea of what credit cards could be and what they represented. What was strange to me about this was first, I had a funny purview to it. I started the company with a focus on savings. It was bought by Capital One. So my job was to ask people what they were looking for. Turned out, it wasn't points, it wasn't cash back. It was more on their bank account. Next, when we started talking with finance teams, they weren't looking for points or sign up bonuses.These were marginal differences. It didn't fundamentally change the outcomes of businesses. They were looking for more control. They were looking to be more profitable. They were looking to go home earlier. So it felt there was a large and fundamental misalignment, where the large scale credit card issuers were thinking a lot about how to get people to spend more money, earn more points, show off the brand, whereas most business owners, people operating companies, were more simple, straightforward, and actually wanted to be more successful to do what they actually cared about. It felt like business owners, the customers, wanted something different than what the core partners wanted. I would say it started with the fundamental misalignment that got us very curious and obsessed with, what eventually led into Ramp, is focused on helping business owners spend less money, spend less time. Patrick: Maybe you could describe and summarize, we've done it elsewhere with a breakdown of Visa that I encourage people to listen to, but maybe you could describe the core business model behind that black card, behind that Chase Sapphire model, and then contrast that against Ramp's conceptualization of its first model of offering a card to businesses. I would just love to understand the business model wedge. People know how a credit card works. We'll get into some of the details. But would love, yeah, you to describe what you saw in a business model and what you hoped to design early on the Ramp side. Eric: Definitely. Every time a card is swiped, a series of transactions go off extremely quickly. First on the merchant side, there's a request, let's say for $100. Approve or deny, thumbs up, thumbs down. Sent through the merchant acquirer card network down to the issuer processor, and eventually issuer. And within six seconds, the issuer has to say, yes, this is good or not. It's good to go. They get the clearing back. Effectively, the merchant, so long as they meet core conditions, is credited for this. They're credited not for the full 100, but for a portion, and what's taken out of that is effectively interchange, as well as network fees. Depending on the type of card used, that can vary anywhere from debit, call it 30 cents, to corporate or high end premium consumer cards could be fees of up to call it 3%. A small portion of that merchant processor and the merchant bank, some portion will go to the network, but the lion's share of that will go to the funding party, which is the issuer. So those would be your credit card in your wallet specifically taking that.The historical reason is they're taking the risk. Effectively the funds have cleared. If there's a problem with the payer who sent the funds, it's on the issuer that they have to hold through to this transaction. If there's credit involved, which is really the dominant product, most cards high end like that, they're taking the underwriting risk involved, and for that, they're able to keep the majority. So this can vary, call it, from two, two and a half, 2.6%. From there, you have a set of fees. You might have the cost of financing that. Maybe you're borrowing, maybe you're using deposit, but there's some amount for every rolling period. You're fronting that. There's credit losses, fraud losses. You're having to account for that. And there's also rewards and rebates, which for most of the industry has become this number one big thing, of the biggest cost of doing business was actually rebating it back to the customer. For the past 30 years, you really couldn't enter this industry unless you were a dominant player, FDIC insured bank. Not a whole lot of innovation, but great marketing organization. So it started this race to who's going to give away, make people think the points are worth more and in the background trying to devalue this. So there was a fundamental game going on, where both consumers and credit cards were trying to outsmart each other.One of the things that we felt was, back to that original premise, people aren't looking for more cash back or points. They're looking for more in their bank account. When you follow that through, you realize that 1% back, 2% back, whatever it could be, sounds great, but not spending that dollar in that first place for the end consumer is 50 to 100 times as powerful. And there's just a lot of ways. People do spend things on subscriptions they're no longer using on services that they could get for less, whatever it may be. So one of the fundamental premises of Ramp was could you identify that? And if so, you might actually have a better claim to make a product that an end customer, a business owner, consumer want to use, because it's much more powerful for them. You go from a startup company with literally 0.000% of the market share to suddenly being able to take things on and do that. So first it was around savings. It fell further into monetary savings was great, but saving time for business owners, even better. If you could replace software that wasn't so useful to do that. So could you actually use interchange, not just as a means of divvying up rewards, but as a fundamental pool to go and create great software that creates a flywheel of value for your end customer. So the premise was let's make things. If you can make things that people actually want to use, that people want to pull out, use their card more than others in their wallet, that'll create more volume, that'll improve the economics that you keep on the funds flow. Patrick: In the early days, I'm always really curious what you attribute the success to with new customers that are trying Ramp, which is not an established brand. You said before we hit record the founders of most of your competitors wore top hats. These are old, old companies, and this is a brand new one. So how did you win early on? What was it that caused those early wins? Because Ramp's founded in 2019. I think it's one of the fastest growing companies by market value ever in the many billions of market value today in 2022. So what do you attribute that early success to? Eric: For me, building with and having real relationships with people building businesses, actually listening to them. From the get go, before we shipped a single card or a single product, we talked with a hundred finance teams and founders. And rather than going and saying, ""Would you buy our product we're coming out with,"" we said, ""We're trying to build a product that's focused on helping your business spend less money, spend less time. Can we get your advice?"" And it shifted the relationship from being on opposite sides of the table, so to speak, of I'm trying to get something from you, would you buy it, to let's sit on the same side of the table together and problem solve and talk about what real issues you have in your business. We started to learn things. We thought it was all about saving money. It turned out that actually for many finance teams, the problem was not, can I get a card. It was, I've got cards. I have seven. People don't turn in the receipts on time. I'm paying for things that are more expensive than what friends at other companies are getting charged. I feel like I'm getting ripped off. I could be running a lot more efficiently and my partner is trying to get me to spend more and outsmart me. So there's not many people on this side. So even that relationship of we're here to build and align our business with you and the sincerity of I'm here, we've got a team with almost entirely engineers at the time, and we want to build together with you was very different and refreshing than what most finance teams and the like were used to.And a card is a somewhat different, even from business model than traditional SaaS. It's not, here's a contract which you buy, and if you have seats, you go with it. It's invisible. It almost pays you. Our monetization effectively grows with people's growing trust in the business. So the whole premise was how do we grow trust with you, build with you. That was the initial wedge in and why we were able to grow. It turned out that a lot of people who went were building great businesses. This wasn't a product where there was low awareness. People had heard of credit cards. In fact, they wanted to stop hearing about it because they had other problems to solve in their business. But when you make a decision, they would call up other finance teams, founders, people in their network, and for the first time people were hearing actually this product is different. It's aligned with us, it's saving us money. It's replacing other sets of softwares. You should use it. So that was the initial jump. And then the pandemic was a huge accelerator for us. That just went from, the premise of savings went from interesting to fundamentally important. If you didn't know what happened to the financing markets and having to deal with remote made our digital product first important.",2295
138,Eric Glyman - Reimagining Corporate Finance,Breaking Down the Invisible Business," Patrick: I really like this concept of almost the invisible business, where if you're successful because they're using your software, which presumably you're not charging for some or all of it, it just comes with use of the cards, no one has to make a big buying decision. You'd start at zero and ramp, sorry for the pun, it could ramp very quickly and aggressively. Describe that software in the early days. If really what you're selling is an easier life made possible by easier software and then you're making money on something that they're used to, but it's invisible, what was that early software and what was co-building like? I love when especially enterprise companies do this, but the actual literal tactics of how you do it is very interesting to me. What kinds of questions were you asking? How often would you show them an iteration of the thing before it was shipped? The details of this co-building are really interesting to me down to the most granular, if you can share them. Eric: Happy to. Let's follow that premise through. We're building this together. We're trying to seek advice for people, and people would give you advice and that it was excellent. We were seeing common themes in a lot of the art was we went back to this Henry Ford ism of you want to build a car, not a faster horse. Trying to really understand what's the problem, what's the job to be done, and how do you build products that ultimately align to solving that end problem. Not necessarily solving it in the way or in what people are asking for because often they were going to the familiar. The first product that we came out with was this corporate card designed to help you spend less was the moniker. If you look through it, it actually was a set of products, streamlined all around helping people close their books faster, going from card, which would trigger IRS requirements if you spent over $75 to collect receipts, to label that, getting it into accounting software and the like, and then trying to give insights around ways that you might spend less. That was the first product. The way that it was built, I'll give you a couple of examples. So one of our early customers was a direct to consumer business called Candid. I think Nick Greenfield has been on one of your early episodes. They were scaling incredibly rapidly at that time. Went from, I think, 10 people to 250 in the time period of, I want to say a year and a half, two years, and there was a lot of chaotic-ness. Like anything, when you're hiring new product teams and engineering teams, new design teams, they would have problems like they were spending on lots of project management software. They were spending on lots of new design software and suites. Our statement to them was, ""We want to save the time and money. Are there areas that you know are wasting time for you guys or money?"" Some areas they knew, others they didn't.On the second part, we wanted to save you money and we said, ""Okay. Would you send us your past 90 days of transactions? We'll go through and see what we can do."" And at the time, it was very much done by hand. We were trying to figure out based off of the credit card descriptors, we see it was super not clean. Could we build some scripts to help clean that up? So things like TRL Star 1011, we could see, okay, that was Trello. SMRT's Star, the invoice number, that was Smartsheets. So on and so forth. And we started to see patterns emerging. If you actually understood what the merchants were, you clustered them, it turned out for them, they were paying for, I think in order of five sets of software that did the same thing in project management. They were paying for some vendors where they were grandfathered into an old annual plan and the new plans were actually materially less. We came back to them early on. Not just, ""Hey, if you use this card, we'll give you these insights on an ongoing basis. We found a quarter million dollars in savings. Let's talk through it."" And it went from, ""Okay, this is a vendor trying to sell me some product to use,"" to, ""They just spent time going through our data, showing us how to spend less. We'd be happy to switch cards. Send over."" And it was lots of moments like that. It was both putting in the elbow grease and the manual work to figure out what were the patterns. What could you automate through software to take what was a rote manual process and have that done through code? To next, starting to build patterns within the software that would say things. So, that was money.Other ones were focused on time. The most painful experiences for anybody who's worked, it's this weird relationship on getting receipts in. It fundamentally doesn't make sense. Tend to believe that if the credit card issuers actually just collected receipts, did it concur an expense if I shouldn't exist. You could actually pull a lot of data from the merchants and get it into your books. It's a bizarre thing that's there in the first place. And because they didn't, there's all these bad design decisions that follow from it. If you want to get a transaction from Amex to concur, it takes 24 hours. It means that if you're an employee and you're at dinner, you're not going to take a photo and wait the next day. You usually put it in your wallet and forget. The average receipt is charging a month later. So we're hearing this all the time from finance teams. We said, ""Okay. Well, the problem is you can't close your books. You have to restate things constantly or answer to your bad hygiene. Let's just do this. We're in the authorization layer. Let's text a card holder, when they have a receipt in their hand. Let's build some OCR to be able to match it to the right transaction. And from then to today, the average receipt is turning within 30 minutes on Ramp. The question was not, again, how do we design something that'll get people to use a card that was one of the byproducts, it started with, what's costing business money they shouldn't be spending? What's costing them time? And then, how do we either manually, or through the software process line and experience, help them achieve these goals? And then that became the product. Patrick: If you look at the website today across the four categories, start scale, streamline, and save, it's more than a dozen individual things. I don't know how many of those live in the same screens of software or something, but there's a lot going on in terms of the functions or the jobs that you're doing for your partners. And again, the business is less than three years old. So talk me through how you've gone about building the company itself and the team fast enough to be able to do that many different things well? Because typically, this story in this world would be, you might build the initial product for three years and not even launch it to make it really tailored to the customer. Seems like you've built much faster and in more directions. And so I'm really curious, what made that possible? Eric: Yeah. That was an explicit design decision around, fundamentally, what the company needed to be. And some of this came from, we'd sold our last company to Capital One and saw, what were they extraordinary at, but what were they not great at? Spent a lot of time with American Express, with our prior company. Got to know Chase in a lot of ways. And our view is, they had fundamental things they were excellent at, whether it was extraordinary brand, extraordinary credit writing ability, extraordinary distribution, but they were incredibly slow. Form Factor Ricard has hardly changed in 30 years. Compliance functions that were set up for real and important, I think, regulatory review purposes were extended to become, effectively, a bat that made development take three months, for even changing a webpage, or the color of a button, because of real and mostly perceived plausible risk. And so a lot of the question was, how could we design parts of our own organization that dealt with regulatory, potential legal, or even financial services, that could not, and could never go down, to be extremely methodical and deliberate? But for most of the rest of the webpage generations, of software services on the top that involve the movement of money directly, how do you make that go really fast? How do you actually deliver what we hope that the first kind of really engineering and product-driven organization in the credit card space? And so that was a lot of the initial premise.And to do that, we put our money where our mouth was. The first 10 people, seven were engineers. One was on design team from IDO. One was on talent. It was people who could build things of structure, who endeavored to try to find extraordinary talent. And even from the first pool, we worked really hard to find really outlier levels of talent. Whether it's some of the team from Paribas [inaudible], to folks like Calvin Lee. Calvin was top of his class, MIT, finished in two-and-a-half years. Google Brain, Facebook AI research, came to work on our team. Veeral Patel, Veeral’s extraordinary. Was going to WWDC from the time he was 14, building apps. Pablo, who built out the engineering office for Lyft in New York and the like. And so we tried to have a team that was extraordinary in capabilities from the get go, that would attract other people who wanted to work with other great people, wanted to build and credit processes that for areas of engineering, we needed to go super fast. We would do this and operate and ship consistently. And parts of the infrastructure that needed to go slow, have very low latency, could never be taken down, do that, but isolate them and have separate processes around and make sure the engine around talent was really a forefront focus of the company.",2158
139,Eric Glyman - Reimagining Corporate Finance,"Recruiting, Marketing and Leadership at Ramp"," Patrick: I think about recruiting as being about pitching who you're going to work with, what you're going to work on, how much cash you're going to make, how much equity and therefore potential upside are you going to garner? How would you say Ramp approaches those four things in balance? Are there some that you emphasize more than others? Why were you able to get those people to all say yes? Eric: Just trying to understand what was important to them. Everyone has dreams, aspirations, things they want to do. Some want to work on and build great companies, be a part of great organizations, to having a strong talent density is just, why do so many people go to McKinsey? Why do so many people go to Goldman? Because other good people are there. And so trying to explicitly have a interesting mix of people and this talent density was important as a goal in and of itself. Next was ownership, especially for people going on and taking that much risk, they either want to work really hard and be able to sit on the upside. And so compared to others, we allocated a lot, not only to the pool, but even actually delayed the founding of the company, put debt on it originally, so people, the first time effectively, could buy founder shares. And be thinking not just about ownership, but also tax optimization, things you could do for people early at the company. And so thinking about the long term from their perspective, what could be great.Next giving of a lot of responsibility and then having no illusion about the long term. It's possible that we'll all work together for 20-plus years building this company. That'd be great. But it's possible some want to go there, see what it's like, and go and start their company later. And when I look at some of the first 22 have gone on to do that, and we've been there to support them. And so I think a lot of this is around having like a real exciting mission that feels worth pursuing. Credibility, not just in what you're doing, but that you actually ask, or are listening to what's important to them in their own life and career, following through on that, and as it changes, not just having a relationship building the company, but helping them actualize what they care about and believe in over the course of their life. Patrick: How do you think about the biggest mistake that you've made far in Ramp and the lessons that it taught you that might be portable to other entrepreneurs out there? Eric: Generally, the moments when we found ourselves in the most trouble is when we knew there were problems along the way, or there was something fundamentally broken, we were getting signals, we didn't act on it quickly enough. I think that this can happen sometimes in, whether it's talent, is probably one that can be broadly related in building a company, stumbling for the real revenue 65 times over year-over-year in 2020, seven-and-a-half and 2021. At that scale, people who were really proficient in great getting 10% better, 5% better every month, mathematically, we're not scaling. Keeping people in roles or actually expecting that people who were ahead of to be able to take things on at larger and large scale, either resulted in teams having to work around in getting, effectively, parts of the organization to crash on each other, or extreme stress on people who probably would have been happier and better off. We just said, ""Look, you're great, but being able to work with someone who's seen, it done it, you're going to get further in your career."" And so not addressing those. And then similarly, in some customer conversations, we have some extraordinary relationship, whether it's from potato farms, companies sending things quite literally into space, multi-thousand card holder deployments at single companies, publicly stage, private, you name it.But for some of our larger customers, where we’re in this enterprise relationship, I come from a consumer background, where it's generally simple. We want to have a product, let's do this. I think in some enterprise relationships, it's really complex. It's buying trust, it's whatever. And so I can think of one without giving the specifics, one relationship where we were in a pilot with a large-scale public company for a year-and-a-half. And there was a never-ending list of asks of different things that people wanted. I think on both sides, there was mutual trust loss, because you couldn't get actually what people were looking for. They were making asks. The team working on, was getting exhausted from, ""This is the fourth RFP. You've asked us for 40 sets of things."" You're tired of it. And then rather than working through the problem, people gave up. I generally think that the failure modes are when people work around each other and don't actually address something here is broken. Do we want to take this forward or not? We're adults. As a company, how do we actually get to the heart of the problem? I think both of those stemmed from avoidance, or not actually facing what is a fundamental breakdown in a problem. And typically, that's where the most problems and bad things have happened for us. Patrick: What have you learned most about marketing? Obviously, you've been an entrepreneur before Ramp, so I guess this could be a holistic question. But at Ramp specifically, what lessons in marketing has the business taught you? Eric: It's evolved pretty heavily over time. The first one is that you need to test things and actually show it to people. So this is not like go out and do studies, and try to go and get people's reaction. In many ways, Ramp is a large-scaled relationship business. We have over a 100,000 cardholders, but these are 5,000 businesses. And if you want to, you can talk with a ton of them every month, week, whatever. And if you're putting ads out, not only do your existing customers see it, but others. And I think one of the best things that you can do is, as you're going and creating, actually show it to people and say, ""You've got three different versions. What do you think about this? What do you see?"" Because you can actually start to go and get real insights and perspectives about what you're doing. So that's one, a real earnest showing it to people, you can generally arrive much better. And your best ads are never the first, it's usually the 10th or 15th, and you need to cycle to get real honest reactions. Not just hear what people say, but also like look at their eyes, look at their face. Are they smiling? These subtle things. You only get one first impression, but you want to see those first impressions on people, is one.The next, I think that there's a tendency, certainly I had it, but I think a lot of founders have it, to focus heavily on product. And tell you about all the features and things that you can do rationally. And organizations are bizarre ecosystems. The map of what people are looking for is, unfortunately, not always rational. And your model of rationality isn't necessarily even the reality of it. And so thinking less about marketing the product and the futures, and getting more into how do you create desire? What are people looking for? How do you tap into that? And think of it less of about informing, showing what a product could look like, what are the features, where the ROI? But what are the things that meet people want to do things like gets stuck in their head, they can't stop thinking about it? These concepts that just stick with people. And so, I think that those are the key things, for me, that this is a significantly larger dollar scale than the last company we had. And I think that if you can do these few things, you can go a pretty long way. Patrick: It reminds me of my friend Jeremiah's note that, for any company, you should understand what they make versus what they sell. And the gap between those two things is often the story of their margins. Which is really, really interesting. Basically saying the same thing. What have you learned about managing a senior team? I'm curious how many people report to you. But more generally, in something growing this quickly, you must be very good at delegation, by definition. But how have you done that well? What advice would you offer others trying to manage growth of this speed? Sixty-five-x in a year sounds great from the outside, but I know, having seen it from the inside of companies, that it's hell on earth in certain ways. Growth is very hard. So what have you done there to improve the way you've manage people on the senior team? Eric: Some of it is like a framework shifts. I feel like people's first company it's, ""Don't go out of business. Be terrified to let a dollar go."" It's often a scarcity mindset. I think people say is talk about this abundance mindset. But for me, what really internalized it was, there was a day when I was quite literally 33% of the headcount. Today. I'm 0.3%. I'm just quite, literally not as helpful and not as impactful as what I used to be. And I think that the larger that companies get, I think that the more the role of a founder and people managing shifts to one, really clarifying, where are we trying to go? And what is the vision? And so making clear, what is that we're trying to solve for? Can you go down to the nth degree of more concreteness? And so people can say, ""I understand it. Nothing is left to ambiguity. Let me go and propose different ways and paths that I can get there."" I think part of my job is clarifying that vision. Some of the quantitative goals, some of the versions of how, and so people can start to trade up and you can actually create alignment among larger organizations.And the second, one of my favorite business thinkers ever, were coaches. So whether it's like John Wooden, UCLA, Bill Walsh, “The Score Takes Care of Itself”, I think a lot of my job is not to do. There are moments where I'll have to go into the org and break things apart and even just work on things together. It's much more about helping people live up to their potential. If you're trying to hire extraordinary people, there's a reason in leadership roles, they're capable of great things. And I think a lot of the question, generally, failure mode happens for me when I try to go and solve what is the functional problem versus what makes this person great and how do I put them in scenarios that tap into their strengths. Help them see some of their blind spots and allow them to do the things that make them great. And so I think a lot of my management style comes back to trying to remember what are the strengths, go over that, identify what are the gaps, and say, ""This is people. You're spending a lot of time. How do we find someone to compliment you? Should this be your responsibility? Or do we want to give this away?"" And generally, when you do that, things start moving a lot better.",2455
140,Eric Glyman - Reimagining Corporate Finance,What Ramp Does Differently," Patrick: Do you think that Ramp has done anything out of the ordinary? We're talking about on the financing side? You already mentioned the notion of delaying the founding of the company, which is more on the employee side, which is super interesting, I hadn't heard that before. But when it comes to investors, you've got a great cap table, many of whom are familiar to our audience. What have you done that's unique or differentiated here? Or do you think you've just really tried to run a best in class cap table process every time? Eric: There's definitely some things that are unusual, both on the cap table and assembly of capital, as well as also some of the use of it. I think we're one of the largest companies that holds a material portion of stable coin in our balance sheet. And so there's some interesting things on both portions. But we've never actually made a fundraising pitch deck. Whether it was a seed, to even the most to recent rounds, we've never gone out to race. Typically, in the same way we went to customers and said, we never said, ""Would you like to buy this product?"" We would say, ""Could we get your advice on this?"" We would meet with investors, say, ""We're working on this. How do you think about this?"" We would show progress and get their advice. And so we transformed the relationship from the get-go. They're not trying to go and raise funds from you. Even though, who knows, maybe they could entertain that, too. They're trying to solve a problem. And you're an expert in the business or in the industry, you see things, how can we go and solve these problems together? And they created almost a pool instead of people to pitch, but people that, potentially, you could fill it out and see if you would want to work together on some problems. Whether it's closing customers, think your business challenge, hiring people. When you saw things were working, both parties wanted to work with each other. So a different kind of design premise.Next, I think that a lot of founders think in terms of, you need to go out, run a process, whoever has the highest price, go do that. And I think that people optimize locally of the highest price and least solution surely must be the thing. Argues that is wrong optimization. It's about maximizing long-term total enterprise value. And doing that is much more about assembling a world class of investors who want to be there, not just now, but over the course of many, many years. People who trust you throughout the industry and want to build together with you. And the way to do that is not by trying to stretch and squeeze every last dollar and save every last share, but trying to foster love and trust. And so we'd meet with a lot of people, build relationships. And then when it came time to do rounds, generally, it might be someone was thinking about it. We'd say, ""Look, we appreciate it."" I'm not going to, obviously, shop or share, but for folks who say something is happening, we'd like to think about it, or set some ranges, people would come together, we would never pick the highest price. And that was for a reason. First we'd never pick the highest price, but we would try to figure out how do we get a collective of people working together, find people with unique skill sets that we can go into, whether it's for advice around certain components of our business. Once we had done that, we would say, ""Okay, well, sounds like people wanted to buy, call it, 20%, 15% if the business. We would like to do it a lower price. But we would also like to sell less to the company."" And so our rounds in the past are very different than the typical 20% round, or it's 15%, there's one lead than everyone's else. It's often much more of a collective pattern. And there's a few other things that we experienced that happened with that. First, because you're not taking the highest price for employees.It's much more of a, ""Okay, wait a minute."" Meaning like the four MNA is lower again. So actually for employees, there's a long-term benefit, but a feeling of there's excess value on the table. I can have some comfort in this. For investors, maybe it was a lower amount, but you want to talk about it. You invested in this thing, it was a hot round you bought in and actually the true value is probably above it, which demonstrates your ability to get into great investments. The more people talk about it, the more people hear about it. If you way over perform, your course can always raise. If things don't go perfectly to plan you have some operating room in leverage and it starts to create, I think what it adds up to is the sense of inevitability. I think, at least in the entrepreneur world, Elon Musk was sort of famous for doing this with SpaceX, where they would never take the highest price, kind of slowly build this up over time and you knew if you were buying SpaceX stock, it was going to be a great investment. So in many ways it was modeled after that philosophy of how do we go and bring the right people together, view this as a team effort, not as an adversarial relationship and just try to build a great long term company we're here to do. Patrick: You pique my interest with the stable coin thing too, in terms of use or storage of funds in this case. Why are you doing that? How much of the balance sheet is in stable coin? What's the benefit to ramp up thinking about that? Eric: It's twofold. I mean, single digit percentage, that can say more, but it is substantial. It's meaningful eight figures funds that are in it. There's very interesting characteristics now. If you actually think about it from a treasurer perspective, your alternatives are earn one to two basis points your bank, which is fine. Could do that. I think the predominant use of that is there it should be defensive. What's interesting about this is you can use a small portion in securities that function almost like a covered bond where it's asset backed and one for one with dollars collateralize and audited too by professional auditors. But yet the yield on it can be high single digit percentage points varying month to month, but can go anywhere from 5%-9% was their highest one month yield. Effectively you can buy this in one month rolls.If you do this with, call it a small portion of your balance sheet, you can make with the next 95% plus we do in terms of yield. So one, it seemed interesting from a defensive ability to start to go and get yield and get a little bit more. This, we only did later once we had hundreds of millions on the balance sheet. But second, we serve fast growing businesses and daring businesses across different industries and the amount of growth in the crypto currency industry has been really substantial. So what better way to have credibility in it than to actually be a real market participant? First it's financial, but the second as you start to think about what are the problems that you run into in being a crypto currency related business. So today beyond it being useful from a balance sheet perspective, some of the fastest and growing and largest cryptocurrency companies use Ramp. Today, we don't offer any cryptocurrency related services for product, but it's a realness of saying it's sort of walking the walk. It's like, I understand your business, we're holding part of it, we're exploring and thinking about it and it creates its own opportunities. Patrick: I often like thinking about the progression of a business, not as kind of marching forward from here, but continuing to work backward from some sort of idealized end state. Eric: Love that. Patrick: What do you think that story is for Ramp? What is the beautiful, incredibly frictionless amazing experience at the end of the rainbow that doesn't exist yet? Eric: I think about it almost as what if your card, your bill payments, your software it was quite literally so smart that if you were spending through the software, a dollar elsewhere counted for a dollar five? What used to take days, hours could be totally automated away. So first you have more financial leverage on every dollar that comes through, you have time back. You can quite literally be more profitable or have your team working on strategic work. Then last, starting to really use data to benefit, not just the single one to one relationship with which cards built historically have done, but you start to get the benefit and wisdom of the crowd. Just as Waze, in many ways, revolutionized the navigation and traffic. It wasn't about having a map and knowing where things were, the most interesting data was other cars in the network, where were they stuck in traffic and how could you use it to help the system be more efficient?We think about that for our customers. Could you go and see what the highest performing finance teams, how do they run their companies spend on things, close their books quickly? How do you bring those insights to the thousands, tens of thousands of other companies use that and collectively make them all more successful? So I think it comes from focus and general alignment of we want to help your business be more successful, spend less money, spend less time, have frictionless and automated processes, and then using data to actually help you to be there. So some of the manifestations of that have started to become clear. It's fully automated expense management, where 6% of our companies that enable all of our integrations with Gmail, Amazon for business, Lyft and 90% of all their receipts are fully automated, no human touch at all.It allows employees to be really productive. They don't need spend time reporting, receive, snapping photos of stuff. They can just go back to their work. So that simple versions too. You could imagine extensions where you're buying a set of software and suddenly you see their sales team got you and you're about to pay far above market. But Ramp could help to just running through ongoing procurement processes through travel entertainment processes, where when people are buying hotels, could your car be smart enough, could your bill payment software be smart enough to deliver not just a movement of funds to where you want to go, but to make sure that your dollars and your hours actually go further? So that's the type of teacher, I know it's probably more in spirit than in, you can clearly hear what that looks and feels like. But those are the things that get us really excited and, and folks, we have so long to go to get there.",2316
141,Eric Glyman - Reimagining Corporate Finance,Peering into the Global Economy and Private Markets," Patrick: You're lucky to be able to see tons of the finance activity at, you said more than 5,000 different client customer companies now. What is all that information telling you about the world and the economy? It's obviously been a tumultuous period here for the last six months, let's call it. A bit longer than that in some areas. What insight can you share with us on how businesses are thinking about their own challenges or just any trends or data that you've seen as a result of your unique perch? Eric: What I can say that's been very clear has been kind of a sudden return and rapid growth of travel and entertainment spend. Where it's not the way that it used to be where people are booking all the time to go see clients, and it's from one kind of central node, but heavy degree of companies are having constant offsites. They're moving so we see it in the Lyft of travel, to hotel spend, of Ubers and things like that, but it's much more distributed. It's moving instead of from tier one to tier one, city to tier two to different kind of destination. And even the relationships that people have within companies are much more, not just even hub and spoke, but just often just spoke. Companies moving from different centers across the country, traveling more often and more frequent kind of hybrid offsites. So that's been one.So a far cry from what it used to be, but the travel patterns are differing quite a bit. And that's, I think because financial products have been improved, the efficiency is possible for people to get short term, long term. We're seeing more elements of efficient balancing of capital. Your solution is not no funds raised or $2 million term loan, but you'll see companies starting to go and put things on card or flex payments on, call it, 30 days, 60 day products and more efficiently map eCommerce inflows and sales versus your inventory timeline of getting things shipped. So I think just a lot more capabilities, even for small companies to engage in financial engineering, whether it's through products like Ramp or others. So just different movement patterns, as well as to more efficient capital matching and ability to, maybe this is just Amazon's philosophy of being cash flow efficient wearing off on the rest of the world, but thinking not just an income statement, but in matching cash flows over the course of a company's life are the two things that we're seeing just happening more at small and midsize businesses that I frankly don't think happened or they weren't empowered to do in years before. Patrick: You mentioned SpaceX earlier as an interesting example of innovation in sort of how they deal with the private markets. I'm curious how you think, another thing they're known for is running this very clean internal process for getting liquidity for people that own equity that are employees or whatever over time to finance their life just like anybody else would, how have you thought about that for yourself or your teammates with a market value that's grown so quickly in a very different business, like you said, than when it was three people, a real thing that's going to be around? How do you think about providing secondary liquidity to employees? Because it seems like the philosophy of that is going to matter for a lot of these companies that are staying private for longer, potentially keeping their options open for longer. What has been your strategy? How do you think about it? Eric: It's all now starting to get quite relevant. I'd say it's very top of mind. I don't think that we're fully settled in the view of what this looks like. I think that principles basis, first it's important. I think that people are obviously here to create value over the long term. Sometimes for people being able to take a little bit off the table so you can really focus full stop over many, many years matters to people. I think as a premise, especially for companies that are getting over, have vested stock, been with a company for a period of time, it's time to do that, is one. So I think viewing just talent as a key input, making sure that people in their life continue to be really happy is important. So that's one. The next there's a lot that goes into just the design of this premise, whether it's in private placement or tender offers, there's different time duration of tender has to take place over three months plus, it has to be broadly marketed, be attributed to be balancing kind of supply and demand. There's some platforms to do this. But there's a lot of different rule and design decisions with it. SpaceX was I think a good one, but on another one as well I understand that Airbnb was another example that said, if you're at the company, you can't sell secondary and it created this negative incentive for people to say, if you needed liquidity, leave, leave to go sell it.There's been a very kind of growing up in the industry of, okay, you need think about how you can give liquidity to people who are there, keep long term alignment incentives. Often that comes in the form of, can't sell more than X percentage of your stock of long term vested, or no more than Y percent per year. Trying to do that and then run regular processes. I think a lot of people today talk about how Anduril does this. Where I think they call it on the order every half a year just about. So long as there's sufficient interest, people can go and say what they're thinking about. That's been such a hard stock for investors to buy that there's generally requisite interest that effectively there's matching processes to go on through. So I think it's going to evolve a lot over the coming years.I think the other trend as well has been loans that people can take against it, sort of going from only Silicon Valley Bank, First Republic to even companies being built specifically to provide this. So we're fascinated by it. I wish I could give you a conclusive of, ""Here's what we've settled on."" But you can't run around it. And I also think too, if you're sort of asking what are people's desires in the same way, people's biggest impact, they'll take care of their families. You need to be a party to that. And actually I do think it's an obligation of management teams to get to. I think it tends to happen in probably the third to sixth year, depending on the stage of the company and I think we've fallen into it. So in the coming months, let's talk about it.",1400
142,Eric Glyman - Reimagining Corporate Finance,"Past Challenges, Future Goals"," Patrick: It's a fascinating one. It raises the question for me of, if there are other areas of this company building art and process that you think just should be much easier for the founding leadership team? Are there aspects of building a company still that you find just crazy unnecessarily hard or look back on and it's like, ""I can't believe that was so difficult?"" Eric: I think one of the fundamental premises of business is like, you cannot be good at that many things at once. Even the greatest company in the world can pick a couple of things that they are extraordinary at, the rest maybe are halfway decent and hopefully not too many terrible. But if your plan is to be excellent at everything, it's a fundamentally crazy plan. In the same way, it is a little bit nuts that for most companies it's like, whether you're a deep tech company working on self-driving fundamentals and machine learning data sets to a delivery company to a farm and one of the core first challenges you to figure out in your credit card software, your management software, your accounting software, your HR software, all these different sets of suites are kind of manual processes. So I think that this trend of the standardization of if you use the stack to be more successful it's a good thing and we like to be a part of that.I would say that for me generally the things that I've hated come in these sort of sets of TDM. So we've been better, I think, on the financial side of automating away some of these sorts of different challenges. But one that I think is very interesting, and now we're seeing it with larger brand sales stack. There's even basic things like if you want to manage the inputs, it's very hard. So while it's great that there's CRMs like Salesforce. I think all the rests of the things of how busy are your calendars? What's the productivity? The calculations around specific people? If you actually dig into how I would say for me this is top of mind, sales ops, revenue operations. It's very bespoke I think in a lot of companies right now and a little bit chaotic. So that's a space that I think is important, particularly in the concept of companies can grow faster than ever. They're still in my mind as not correct SAC and the only way you can get there is by heavily constraining it and trying to pursue this. So that's the space that for me, I think someone solves it we'll buy it. Other people would use it, that's just mine. Patrick: What has you most excited about Ramp specifically in the next 12 to 18 months? Sort of that intermediate term, probably edge of your near term planning, what gets you excited? What's getting you out of bed? Eric: Just feel lucky and giddy, frankly, just to have the chance to ... This is sort of the moment that many of us had dreamed about years ago came sooner than we anticipated. But to do nine figures in revenue in less than two years from launches is a little bit wild. So some of this is just, ""Don't screw it up, stick with it and stay humble."" The ones for me, very specifically, some of my background was around turning data into savings for customers. The last company, we processed a hundred million emails a day to generate nine figures plus savings for our customers. I think that placement in some of the workflows that Ramp is in combined with the value can present back, I want to go a lot deeper there to go not just from laying best in class tools, but real interesting data products and saving time, money, everything on top of it is a big space that we can do a lot more of is one.I think that the other one for me is overlaying of if you are deeply embedded close to the metal in the movement of funds, you have insights about what best in class looks like, could you make recommendations and build more efficient processes for people? So when you think about the card, it's fundamentally, it's a 30 day fixed product with inter change as a way to pay for it. But we're moving over in a matter of months after launching bill payments over a billion dollars a year through bill payment, reels and alike. Could you go and start to help people, no matter how they're paying, get more balance cash flows, more of every dollar an hour? So it's starting to take our fundamental components and mixing and matching them to new form factors, simple ways for however companies want to financially improve their company. Ramp will partner with you for doing that with high precision. Patrick: Eric, it's been so much fun. What a crazy business story you said, zero to a hundred million in a couple years is not common. So really cool to hear the story and how it was accomplished, and we'll keep going from here. I ask everybody the same traditional closing question. What's the kindest thing that anyone's ever done for you? Eric: I mean, this is going to sound really trite. And I think it's believing in me and checking in. I think that one of the hardest things about starting and scaling a company over many, many years is it's a constant battle of, ""It's not going to work or come back with proof."" To have someone, and there's probably a dozen people who I'll never forget it at different moments who took a shot and said, you know what? I'm going to trust you. Go give it a shot and prove it and gave the rope, gave the possibility a chance for me to go and try. What else can you ask for? This fundamental, most unkind things that someone can do in business and also people's life is, far as I know, people only have one shot and I mean, the worst thing you can do is say, ""No, I don't believe in you."" Or, ""Don't do this."" And there's times when it's too busy, it's not good fit. But I think that giving people that shot and that opportunity, whether it's investing in them, it's spending time, it's simply saying, you know what? I believe this can work. How can I help? And being sincere about that is really rare. Patrick: It's one of the most common answers, as won't surprise you, taking a bet, maybe beyond the current evidence or beyond some need to or whatever, it's obviously something we should all do a lot more of. So, wonderful conversation Eric, thanks so much for your time. Eric: Thanks Patrick. Appreciate it a lot.This site uses cookies to improve your browsing experience.

143,Dmitry Balyasny - Building a Better Model,Introduction," Patrick: My guest today is Dmitry Balyasny. Dmitry is the managing partner and CIO of Balyasny Asset Management, otherwise known as BAM. BAM runs a multi-strategy multi-PM model that aims to produce consistent, absolute returns. Since its founding in 2001, it has produced only one negative year and become one of the largest firms of its kind. Please enjoy my conversation with Dmitry Balyasny.",101
144,Dmitry Balyasny - Building a Better Model,BAM's Origins and Differentiating Characteristics," Patrick: So, Dmitry, this is my first opportunity to talk to somebody that runs an investment firm structured and built like yours. There's lots of names for these. I think the original name was sort of the platform model, multi-strat, pod shop, there's all these names that float around the professional investing community and yours is one of the largest. Maybe you can just begin by giving me a little bit of the origin story of the firm. And I always love telling these stories in sort of chapter headers, like what you view in hindsight as the key phases of the evolution of the firm. Because I know you focus both not just on investing, but also on building the firm. So, give us that origin story with a few of those key way points along the way. Dmitry: First of all, thanks for having me on, real pleasure. I've enjoyed the podcast over the years. So, it's a honor to be here. Origins go back to my origins as a trader and thinking about how to build out business around trading. So, when I started in the business, I started as a broker while going to school, but I really wanted to trade. But I was really got awful at trading and I was losing all the profits that I was generating as a broker and commissions I was generating in my own personal trading, to such an extent that I went broke when I was 23 and really figured out I needed somebody to show me what I was supposed to be doing. So, I applied to lots of trading firms and I was hired into the Schonfeld proprietary trading firm training program. And it was really a good opportunity to learn some structure, which was inherently missing in my trading. So, there was a good opportunity to learn from guys who had been successful for a long time. It was an open environment where you could talk to people and just less of a formal program, but more where you can pick stuff up and people were open to talking about what they did. So, I learned a little bit about money management, timing, discipline, risk management, and those things are all just as important as the stock selection or investment selection piece. Even after doing that for a while first year there, my total income was zero. Thankfully, they bought us lunch, so we didn't starve. I started making money pretty consistently.To go back to your original question. It was foundational for me seeing the way the firm was structured, where there were lots of different traders with lots of different methods and specialties and styles. The time when I started was about 100-something traders, and by the time I spun out to start my own firm, I think it was about seven years later, there were over 1,000 traders. I grew up with the mentality of it makes sense to have lots of different types of risk-takers, because you have less correlation, you could attack different areas, the markets, and have specialists in different areas. So, it always made sense to me. The other thing I did at the time after having some success trading was I had the opportunity to help manage our internal fund-to-funds portfolio, which invested in different hedge funds just with our own personal capital. So, that was also really helpful seeing how different firms were structured and who stood the test of time and who tended to have lots of volatility in both their trading and their businesses.Doing that for a long time, it really further cemented my initial belief, because the firms that we were invested with 10 years later, almost in all cases, were variations of a multi-manager model, where you have different risk-takers, different specialties, different styles within the same firm. Those firms tended to be much more durable over time, unless you were scalable. Whereas the firms that were structured around an individual risk-taker, even if he was fantastic, they had lots of volatility over time. And in some cases, that paid for itself, and some cases it didn't. But when I was launching BAM, and thinking about the type of business we wanted to build, we very much wanted to build a really enduring, scalable, institutional business that would do well regardless if I was trading while we're having a good year or not having a good year. Patrick: So, there's something very firm over fun to use a phrase that pops up here and again, where for this to be successful, you obviously have to do a lot of things well, you need great risk management, you need amazing recruiting, you need to be really good at incentives and thinking about holistically a portfolio level versus just your own book. These are probably very hard things. Each of them that you try to constantly get better at over time. How would you describe the state of this platform model today? What differentiates good from great in the world of platform hedge funds in 2022, in your view? Dmitry: Just thinking about the industry, I kind of never understood why the hedge fund industry needed 10,000 hedge funds just from a individual wanting to hang up a shingle and try their luck. Obviously, the economics in a lot of cases make sense to try that. But certainly they used to, it's much harder today. But from an institutional investor perspective, the last thing you want is 10,000 options. So, I always thought the industry would consolidate over time and that's really accelerated over the last decade, post '08, I would say even the last three, four years that's accelerated again. I always thought it would look more like the private equity industry at maturity, where you have a handful of dominant firms that generate most of institutional alpha at scale. And they have a lot of different offerings and a lot of different structure and a lot of investment talent. And then, you have a larger number of specialized firms that tend to be smaller, but could be very good in different niche strategies, but you don't need 10,000 of them, but maybe you need a few hundred. So, in the private equity equivalent, it might be somebody doing middle market energy deals, the hedge fund equivalent of that could be somebody in a particular sector of a particular geography. I think that's where the world has been heading.In terms of how to get there, it's a very difficult model to execute well. And you can kind of see that by just how few firms have been successful. The folks that we competed with when we started are pretty much the same folks we compete with today. The number of institutional quality, enduring business models in this space, you can really count on one hand. And for the most part, they've been there for 20 years or in some cases longer. So, why is that? Because to your question, you do have to get a lot of things right. It starts with the mentality of the founders and the management, being a good investor and being a good trader doesn't necessarily make you good at allocating risk or managing other people's risk than hiring other risk-takers. And in many cases, it's actually counterproductive. If somebody's fantastic risk-taker, it's kind of like Michael Jordan wanted to pass the ball, it took a long time before he was comfortable passing the ball, but then they became really good.It's kind of the same thing with hedge funds. It's a huge shift from somebody to go to a model that's centered around a particular investment process and a particular person, or one team to having, in our case, we have 125 teams. So, it starts with that mentality and really wanting to do that and buy into that and be comfortable allocating risk to people, which I started doing within my trading group 25 years ago at small scale. But beyond that, once you're comfortable with that, then you really need to figure out what is going to be your competitive advantage? How do you get top talent to come work with you? What are you going to offer them in terms of economics and infrastructure and capital and investment intelligence, et cetera? And then, once you have that nexus, it's like, ""Okay, how do you actually get everybody to work together? How do you develop people? And how do you manage at scale?"" So, these are all different challenges that you run into over time that makes it a tough model to build out.",1751
145,Dmitry Balyasny - Building a Better Model,Outperforming with Multiple Investing Groups and Strategies," Patrick: Maybe you can just describe in some detail exactly how a firm like this multi-strategy, multi-investor group works in practice. So, if there's, let's just say, a pile of institutional or LP capital that's going into the firm to be managed by BAM, just describe the key ways that that capital is allocated, monitored, et cetera, internally. Because with 125 investing groups, it sounds like a ball of yarned and risk overlays and all sorts of infrastructure and trading become really important. So, just describe how it actually works. If a dollar is going in, how is that allocated dynamically to that 125 team roster? Dmitry: We're structured by business lines, by different strategy lines. Our largest allocation is equities, which you see 80%-90% of risk, now is about 50% risk. You'll have a management team for that strategy where they're responsible for helping to recruit, managing the teams, helping to allocate capital to that. And as an investment committee, we all collaborate on that, but you have a dedicated management team for that particular strategy. And then you have the same thing across other strategies. So, our next largest would be global macro. So, you have 40 global macro teams, it's about a third of our risk. And you have a macro management team that's responsible for the same things of monitoring and managing and allocating capital to those teams. And so on and so forth across all the different strategies, commodities, credit, quan, merger-arb, et cetera. Within each of those, then you have specific capital allocation and risk limits to each of the teams. So, for each strategy, you'll have a general box that we work on as a partnership and as a part of that particular strategy team to figure out what does that box look like? And we always innovate and optimize it every year a little bit. What do you want it to look like in terms of what kind of risks do you think people have skill at taking? How much capital do you want to allocate to that? What other kinds of risks you're comfortable with and what amount? Et cetera.So, like in equities, we want it to be very close to market neutral, very close to sector neutral. We want to minimize factor risks just to have a little bit, you don't spend all your time worrying about hedging it out, but you want to maximize idiosyncratic risks and minimize the factor risks. So, what does that equal to in terms of position? It might be a 50 position portfolio, or maybe for a large team, it might be 100 position portfolio, 50 longs and 50 shorts. Then, you have the same things across all the different businesses, designing that optimal box that people will operate within. Then, you have to customize it a little bit. You might have some things work well in the US, but don't perfectly translate to Asia, for example, or the difference between a relative value rates trader and a more directional macro trader within the macro business. Maybe you have to modify the box a little bit. But it starts with that. Then, you do the same thing across the risk team, so you have a large risk team and then they have specialists dedicated to monitoring all the individual strategies and making sure that everybody's kind of within their risk constraints. And then, the more valuable function once you can do all that is you want to help people get better over time. So, we do a lot of analysis of people's attribution. What are you really good at? What are you less good at? What are other people good at that maybe you can add to your skillset? And how do you kind of evolve as a risk-taker and progress over time? So, we try to give people a lot of feedback on what's working, what's not for you as well as for the overall firm. So, you're not going to take a trader from one style, completely polar opposite, but you want to work on your weaknesses and get a little bit better over time. Patrick: I want to come all the way back down to the core unit, the actual investment team and all the things that matter there. But first I'd love to zoom all the way up to your level. So, you mentioned the strategy heads, equities, commodities, global macro, et cetera, that would be responsible for their groups or their teams. But as you get all the way up to the top, to the CIO position, would you describe what you're solving for? Is there an optimization function that's going on? Are you trying to maximize the Sharpe ratio? What is the solve at the end of the day as you put all these things together? Dmitry: There's always a balance between Sharpe and capacity. You're trying to always find the right balance for that. And we do that all the way from the individual PM level to the overall firm. The individual PM level, you could have somebody who's a four Sharpe, but they only generate $10 million of P&L a year. That's not particularly useful as the firm grows over time. Although maybe it was useful 20 years ago. So, same thing at the firm level. So, you want to generate high Sharpe returns at scale that generate the type of performance that investors are happy to participate in. So, that's kind of what you're solving for. How do you get there? So, you need to figure out, first of all, what strategies do you want to be in? And then how to build all those different businesses over time? You might have a whiteboard of like, ""Okay, here's all the different things we want to have over the next 10 years, but how do you prioritize those?"" And then, which ones do you want to build now? How do you want to build them?So, a lot of what we spend time on is recruiting. So, once you have business plan for something, who's going to manage that? So, you want to get the right leadership in. Then, at the PM level, who's going to take the risk? And you want to really make sure you're getting really top talent. So, we spend a lot of time recruiting. Then, at the development side, today, for example, I did three calls with different risk-takers at three different strategies, 20 minutes each, just talking about what's going on in their portfolio, what opportunities they're seeing, anything we can be doing as a business to help them grow and develop. That always generates a lot of dialogue. So, it generates some ideas that maybe I could say, ""Okay, this is a really particularly interesting idea that the firm could be bigger in that maybe I'll put on my own book."" There could be situations where one of the PMs was interested in a data point that was coming out from a totally different sector that they weren't disclosed to, but that was going to affect their companies. So, I put those two people together, talk about that. So, that's a lot of what we were doing at the top is having an overall plan, executing to that plan, getting the right people on board, and then making sure that the information flows really going around the firm. Patrick: With all the different exposures and managing that exposure and factor exposure, all these sorts of things, gray risk management, I would assume that the idealized end state is some sort of uncorrelated, fairly high, absolute and high Sharpe return stream, and that you deliver that year in, year out every year and that'd be an amazing product, especially if fund correlated. How close to reality is that in these platform businesses? Is that something that's achievable and has been achieved pretty regularly? What causes it to deviate from that? What's been the view of the returns? Dmitry: Nothing's a panacea. There's nothing that's perfect. It's a very good investment structure for consistently compounding capital at scale in an uncorrelated way. That's what we're really trying to solve for. So, most individuals and certainly most institutions will have a couple different large pockets of capital that they need to allocate. The vast majority of things that you can allocate to are correlated. They're correlated to the economy, they're correlated to the general risk and market environment. So, whether you're investing public or private, whether you're investing long only, or long-short equities, or credit, vast majority of things, do you have every investment strategy on the board, 90% of them would wind up correlated to kind of the overall economy.So, when we're trying to put together a market neutral product, that's really uncorrelated, that's designed to fit a particular need. You have years that the equity markets are up whatever 25% and you might be up 15, doesn't necessarily mean you did a bad job and spend the same token. But following year, if the equity market is down 20, you still might be up 15 if you did a good job. That's really what you're solving for. How closely can you get to that? Certainly very challenging to do. And there's periods where it's very difficult with drawdowns just like anyone else. But in terms of the consistency of the strategy, when you're able to do it across lots of different asset classes, and you get to a scale where you do have really diverse risk-takers, it's pretty consistent. Patrick: What kind of leverage is common in this model to put on equity, on underlying cash and that's put into the firm? How's that managed? Dmitry: We look at things from a volatility-adjusted basis. Using our largest fund as an example, we try to run to maybe a 7% annualized vol number plus or minus one or two. If you can put up a two Sharpe on that, that's a pretty good return. Now, the leverage it takes to get to that is a function of the market environment that you're in. If you're in a really volatile environment, then you don't need as much gross leverage, because the moves you're getting are very large. Whereas if you're in an environment like you had three or four years ago, where it was very low volatility, it was really difficult to have enough leverage to get to the target ball levels that you'd like to get to. But I would say in general, if you were to look at the equity business, it's a little bit higher than your typical single manager long short funds. But it's not tremendously higher. And when you account for the diversification of risk taker and diversification of underlying positions, we'll have thousands of positions in a very diverse portfolio and a very low amount of factor risk.The actual realized volatility of those books, in many cases, is lower than an individual portfolio that might have a lot less leverage, but it will have much more concentration, much more tilts, and it'll wind up realizing a lot more volatility. So when you look at these things on a ball adjusted basis across strategies, you can compare how much risk do you want to take in equities versus macro, or macro versus commodities, or credit, et cetera, because you look at them all in the same type of way. And so we want to have very consistent allocations across individual risk takers within a particular range. So if we have, say a very senior risk taker in equities who's had a very long consistent track record with us, and we have the same type of person in macro, for example, we want them running roughly similar allocations.",2489
146,Dmitry Balyasny - Building a Better Model,Managing and Incentivizing Risk Taking Behavior," Patrick: I think now's the time to zoom down into that world of the individual risk taker. And one of the things I was most excited to ask you about is the management of incentives. It's maybe like an oligopoly. There's you, there's Citadel, there's Millennium, there's maybe a few others, but as you said, you can count them on one, maybe two hands. And not just there, you're also competing against people starting their own firms and working in other places. So just tell me everything you've learned about incentivizing talented risk takers in the investing world. Dmitry: I think the most important thing is, you really want to try to ascertain somebody's psychology coming in. It's difficult to do, and you can't always have huge conviction at it up front. Sometimes you can, if you spend enough time with the person, if you have a reference from other people internally. But certainly over time as they're with you for years, you certainly get a pretty good sense of somebody's psychology. And you want people who are really looking to build a business within a business, and are really looking to have a long term career, and have the right psychology aligned with that. So this is a very difficult job, mentally. There's periods where whatever you're doing just completely doesn't work. And maybe something's broken in the process, maybe not. Maybe it's just the market is very difficult for what you're doing during that period. There's a lot of management issues where it's not individual risk takers.Almost everyone we have is managing a team. So some of the larger portfolio management teams might be in double digits of number of people. That's a lot of people management that you have to. Usually it has difficulties at the same time that you're having investment difficulties. You have to be very mentally strong and very mentally committed that this is what I want to do long term. This is the place I want to do it. I really want to build a consistent business. I'm willing to sacrifice shorter term optimization for long term optimization, whether that's spending time hiring quality people, mentoring them, developing them. That's really important. Whether it's managing draw downs, where you need to reduce risk at some point if things aren't working. And so you just need people that have that mentality and are really bought into that. Otherwise, you wind up with the stereotypical clashes of a risk taker versus management, which we really try to avoid. Patrick: And so as you think about attracting people with that characteristic that you just laid out, that would describe a good PM, that's going to be at band for a long time, productively so, what typically wins them over? Is it structured financial incentives that make them feel like an entrepreneur, that are just clear and uncontroversial? Is it other things? What are the things that move the needle? How high is the variance of those things across the firm? Like how customized is each risk taker? Dmitry: When we started, it was over 20 years ago. And we had really good window into what lots of other funds were doing because we ran this fund of funds on the side. We had like a hundred different hedge fund investments. The level of variance in how professionally businesses were run and how professionally people were treated was astounding. You had completely crazy stuff going on at some places. My thought was, if we could just start by not doing anything completely idiotic, and just treating people professionally and having some vested interest in their long term career, that would go a long way. Because it was just really bad, and very inconsistent.And so that was kind of the initial thought. You could just do it professionally. You would immediately be in the top 5%, because the industry was very immature. We didn't have any other advantages. We had no capital, right? We started with 40 million dollars. And our competitors were already in the billions. No capital, no reputation in the fundamental investing. At the time we had a trading reputation. We didn't have a lot of experienced risk takers when we started. And we certainly didn't have any great technology or infrastructure. And we had no idea what we were doing on marketing. Patrick: Great sales stories so far. Dmitry: Yeah. So our first institutional coverage, I opened up the yellow pages and looked up Goldman Sachs and Gold Company. So the only thing that we had going for is was we really were very intent on building a long term business. So we wanted to structure everything in such a way that it would attract talent and retain talent. Because that's the name of the game. These are all alpha strategies, very difficult to totally computerize. How do you attract and retain that talent? So first you need the right underlying structure. So you need economic structure, diversification of risk, and investors that are buying into that, which takes a long time to demonstrate to people that it works. That was kind our model from the get go. Secondly, once you have that, you need to differentiate to the talent coming in. So that'll, by itself, immediately differentiate you from 98% of the funds out there, but how do you differentiate from the other 2% that have a similar scent?And for us, that's always been the culture and environment that we want to provide to people. And I've always wanted to create a business where you have on one hand, you have the culture and collaboration and environment of a small single manager firm, where it's typically tightly knit, everybody's rooting for each other, you go off for a beer afterwards, it's kind one team. But the down with that is, you don't have any risk diversification, you don't have the infrastructure, you don't have the economics usually to attract and retain the best talent. So if you can combine that with the resources of a global platform, with the technology and the infrastructure and economics and capital, I think it'll be really powerful. So that's kind of what we've always tried to do. Patrick: As time has gone on, has that variance, especially at the platform firm level, dampened? Meaning the economic deal that a free agent PM might command at the various platforms looks somewhat similar to each other, and therefore they're really choosing based on that cultural point? Dmitry: I think. So I think people tend to optimize for themselves a few different metrics. Economics obviously is one. Economically, yeah, they're pretty similar. People will have different twists on their offerings between your headline payouts, the total capitals, the expenses, the resources that they're providing you, et cetera. So everybody's kind got a different way of putting that together. But I would say for the leading platforms, like all the offerings are compelling. That's kind of one. Two is, what does the person want to do? Do they want to go sit in the corner and just be left alone to do their thing? Do they want to do their thing, but they want to do it collaboratively with management and have lots of resources that build their thing to the next level? Or do they want to actually have a voice in the overall business and the overall strategy, of what is the best way to build this strategy? How can I contribute? How can I make the overall firm better, the overall strategy better?And people self select on that, because some guys are very comfortable, going into something that's very well established and they have a particular niche in that business, and they just want resources to do their thing within that overall built up business. Others are much more entrepreneurial. Maybe they don't want the risk and expense and distraction of starting their own shop, which is very difficult these days. And for a lot of strategies, it's really close to impossible. But they do want to make an impact overall. And so when they look back on their career, 20 years later, like what'd you do? Generated a consistent pin out. All right, that's great. But over time, if you're spending the vast majority of your waking hours doing something, like what'd you build? What can you look back on and say, I was a part of that? And part of it is being at a world class firm, and a part of a world class strategy, where you could say, Hey, I'm on this team and the team is awesome. I was part of this championship team. We won every year. And two is, I was part of building something, where maybe it wouldn't have looked exactly this way if I hadn't contributed. People self select to different versions of that. And firms are in different parts of that, and businesses within firms are at different parts of that. Patrick: What other characteristics, other than the big overarching one you mentioned earlier about just overall alignment, what are the other characteristics you've seen over the years or decades that are common amongst the great PMs that you've worked with? Are there attributes that they tend to share in common, or that you proactively look for? Dmitry: Yeah. Psychology number one, it's just that the mindset, of developmental mindset, of every year I start with zero, every year, I want to be a little smarter than I was the year before, always working on their craft. That mindset leads to much more consistency over time. You could have somebody's style go in and out of favor. And you could have a year where your particular thing is in favor. You got the couple big themes or trades right. And that's awesome. But to do it consistently, year in and year out, you have to be able to adapt. And the only way you can adapt is if you have this really flexible mindset where you're always trying to learn the new thing, to pay attention to what the new thing is that's going on, and just try to really build a consistent business. So I think that's the most important. Part of that is the line between conviction and stubbornness. And the line between aggressiveness and humility. You need a little bit of both. If you don't have enough conviction, you don't have enough confidence, you don't have enough aggressiveness, you can't ever take enough risk to put up meaningful dollars to be at the top level.But if you don't have enough humility, and flexibility, and adaptability, or whatever your style is isn't working, you lose a lot of money. So if you want to be consistent and have reasonable draw downs relative to your PNL, and adapt to different markets to be consistent year to year, it's really that psychological balance between the two. And another piece is building a team is a real differentiator. And doing that successfully to where one, the person wants to do it. They don't look at their teammates as an automated spreadsheet. They want to mentor somebody and have them become a great analyst and eventually a great PM. So having the desire to do that, and then investing the time and energy to do that at scale across multiple people, is really important. If you aren't invested in that, and you don't take care of your team, and you aren't invested in developing them, and taking care of them both financially and from a knowledge perspective, they're just going to turn over. And if they just turnover all the time, it's very hard to scale a business. Patrick: I'd love to talk about the source of edge, even just the nature of it, and how it's evolved over time. One of my favorite, I think it was William Gibson's lines, was first identification, then commodification. You see that in markets all the time, you mentioned the hedge fund replica strategies, someone finds something and then it goes away. Just describe, in your investing career, especially the BAM era, how has edge changed most do you think? And I'm curious across any asset classes that you want to dive into. How has it changed? Dmitry: Looking at it from, I guess, an equity perspective first, my original strategy from 20 years back, the markets used to be just much more inefficient to where you could have an individual trader put up very strong returns, just because there were so many trading inefficiencies going on over the course of the day or a week. So that still exists, but it's just much, much harder because a lot of those trading inefficiencies have gotten quantified. So now you have the set R programs basically that are doing that all day long, and various high frequency programs, et cetera, in various ways, where they're capturing a lot of those inefficiencies, where previously you could have a discretionary trader capture that. Fundamentally same thing, you could analyze a company. If you were speaking to IR quarterly, that was a differentiator. So that's not a differentiator anymore. That's like cost to do a business.Building models. I remember when we were interviewing PMs and they said, well, I"" build my own models."" So I said, ""Wow, really? Is that worthwhile?"" Like certainly, it wasn't commonplace, because there was enough inefficiency that you didn't need to do it. And then all of a sudden, as more people started doing it, you did need to do. And of course now today, everybody builds their own models. The use of data and technology, so we're offering Python classes for example, internally. And we have lots of folks from all the various strategies signing up to become much more proficient at Python, because it's just a much easier way to screen a lot of data, and have it accessible quickly. And it's relatively newer. The use of lots of different data sets, about a hundred people in our data team now.And so various teams work with them in different ways. Many teams have their own data people, on their own team, in addition to the use of a centralized team. And that's becoming a cost of business, and more commoditized in some ways, but you're always looking for different pieces of it that are less commoditized. Trading infrastructure, where five years ago even, I would say, to have a really good software at the trader's fingertips that would break down real time, all of their exposures, and factor risks, and concentrations, and tilts in a really useful way, it was pretty rare. We've iterated ours a number of times and now it's really good.",3105
147,Dmitry Balyasny - Building a Better Model,Lessons and Challenges From Two Decades of BAM," Patrick: What do you think are some of the hardest decisions that you've had to make, either portfolio wise, like I'm curious how 2008 went, or March 2020, some of the seminal really difficult markets that you've faced while BAM has been live? But I'm also curious, the really hard moments or decisions at the business level too? So maybe just walk us through maybe one each, a portfolio side and a business side, what the hardest decisions or stretches have been in memory? Dmitry: Portfolio side, I guess I would break them into two parts. One part would be where there's a real market dislocation going on, like an '08 or 2020. Another side is when there's less of a market dislocation going on, but you're really drawing down as a business. We had a down year in '18, which is our only down year. So that was more specific to us, although it was a difficult market. They all bring different challenges. In a really volatile, macro driven period, the first thing we want to do is we want to make sure that we're set up well enough defensively so that we can play offense. Because if you're kind of vulnerable, and you're getting killed when everybody else is getting killed, it's very hard to go on offense. And you wind up in a hope situation of, at some point this will end and it'll all be fine. Which of course it does, but you might be gone. Patrick: Right. Dmitry: So that's kind of the first thing that we do, is we already run fairly tight. But we just want to make sure that any tail risks that we have, any negative convexity that might be not obvious in some strategies are hedged out. Any traders we're concerned about, where they were struggling when things were less volatile and now they're really struggling. What could we do to help them stabilize their portfolio so that they can survive this period and come out on the other side and do well? And there were lots of those issues in '08 and 2020. I would say like '08, it was amplified by systematic concern where you're just worried about financial world kind of be there. So I remember being on calls with prime brokers going, when are we going to get our money? Which was a real concern at the time, because you just didn't know if they were going to be able to meet the margin calls. The CDS for prime brokers was going through the roof. We went to cash, Q4 of '08, or largely to cash, just because we were concerned about the systemic environment. And the RV trading, which is most of what we do, whether it's the macro or equities, nobody really cared about the differentiation between this stock and that stock, Q4 of '08. So it made a good decision to go to cash, but then it was actually worrisome, like were we actually going to be able to get the cash?We had some nervous days waiting for wires to come, which thankfully they eventually came. So that was amplified just as a going financial system concern. Another issue was, we wound up slightly profitable that year, in the fund, but we were rewarded with 50% redemptions. We chose not to gate people. Lots of investors needed their money. Then we had business issues worrying about, if we have to pony up money and make sure that you can help the business survive. We certainly don't want to be laying off productive risk takers or business people that you don't want to. We had to step up, and we got to do that a number of times over the years and fund those deficits for periods of time. 2020 we were in a much better place, like as a business, with much more solid capital and great investor base. So we were doing well, trading wise. The improvements that we had made over the years, going through difficult periods, like '18 was for us, where we had too much concentration by strategy, and by risk taker, and by positions. And then we worked really hard to improve that. So by the time we got to 2020, we had much more diversification by strategies, by risk takers, by underlying portfolio positions.So there's just a lot more bets and a lot less factor bets and systematic bets that we didn't want, was one. And then two, it was really helpful from the cultural and communication sense, like everything that we've always talked about being valuable for having a seat here. It's not just about what's the economics on my PNL, it's also like what's the place where I can actually generate the most PNL? And part of that is the collaboration across teams, and the intelligence that you get of what's going on in the macro environment. That really paid off in 2020, initially with intelligence with the healthcare teams, and understanding what was going on with COVID. And then the understanding of what was going on in macro, with the FED intervening, by the communication across macro teams. It was very stressful in terms of, every day you would have some portfolios that were down a lot, others that were up a lot, markets had crazy swings. But it wasn't particularly stressful on the business level, creating this executing the way it was supposed to be. Patrick: If you set aside the really early insights gleaned from watching all the traders and the fund to funds experience, and thought maybe more towards the latter half or something of the band journey. What business decision now, just on the firm side, do you think was the most important that you made, and was it a hard decision to make? Dmitry: The most important early decisions, or one, you having the right founding management team. I've had the same two partners on the business side for 20 years. Investing in that upfront, I think a lot of hedge fund managers, when we talk to guys who are interested in starting their own fund, and they kind of walk us through the economics, like a lot of times it's about, ""I can get somebody to manage the business side for this amount of money."" And it won't be that impactful. And so therefore I'll be better off with the management fee. And it's totally like the backwards way of looking at, in my opinion. So we didn't have any management fee. We started off just trading prop. And so everybody's compensation was just our expense. But even with that, we really invested in management from the start, and that's been hugely impactful over the years.And I would say the mistakes have also been on that side, where we didn't invest in management of particular strategies, or particular functions like risk at a senior level early enough. And when we did that, combined with a core management team and PMs we already had, it really took us to the next level. And the second thing is the right foundation for a fund. Like if you have a standard fund structure, and you have lots of risk takers, it's just not a sustainable model, because at some point somebody's going to make a lot of money, and somebody's going to lose a lot. And if you can't pay the guy that just may, you're constantly going to have a revolving door of talent, of the profitable talent, and you have to be able to pay people market rates. Patrick: So how do you do that, that piece specifically? Like what is the setup? Dmitry: Yeah, if you have a top PM, in the old days, you could certainly start a fund. Today, maybe you could start a fund. You could certainly go somewhere where you could get a payout that's very similar to starting a fund. If you're not doing that, there's no way you're going to retain top talent over time. Those two things, the right economic foundation, not compromising that, and then investing in management, and really valuing that part of the business is really important.",1723
148,Dmitry Balyasny - Building a Better Model,Managing a Short Book and Thinking About Rates," Patrick: It must be really difficult to manage the short side of the book in recent years. It just seems like so many stories of insane volatility amongst heavily-shorted stocks, and just I've heard from other hedge fund investors more and more that shorts that just a sort of balancing basket to take net exposure out, and less and less about generating alpha on the short side. Walk me through the progression of how you've, as a firm, thought about shorting, especially more recently. Dmitry: Ours hasn't changed that much. I think that the basic thought process that you hear about short selling is flawed. Trying to run an absolute return fund, lots of different types of trades to try to engineer a consistent high Sharpe return stream. It's not as simple as, ""I'm just going to buy the best companies that I think are going to go up for the next 10 years. And I'm going to short companies that I think are going to eventually be zero.""I think if that was all it was, it would be a much easier business. And there would be a tremendous amount of overlap between people's positions, because it's not that hard to try to identify the companies that you think, ""Hey, Apple is a great company. Yes, it is, right?"" Maybe you could figure that out a little bit before somebody else, but that's not, to me, the value of a hedge fund. That's not going to engineer a consistent return stream. Like markets are just too efficient.And so that misconception, just looking for one type of trade, creates huge volatility in people's portfolios. So yes, if your short book is entirely composed of companies that you think are zeros, you're going to have a very volatile short book. And if you're good at picking, maybe over time that'll make money, but you're going to have crazy volatility. What we're really trying to do is we're in the relative value business, we want to be in the business of consistent spreads. So whether you're operating a casino, or you're operating a bank, whether you're operating a multi hedge fund, you're in the spread business. And so, we're looking for lots of different types of trades, and you're looking for outperformance between your longs and your shorts. And so, you're going to bucket things in different ways.Yes. You might have a structural bucket in a particular sector where you might have some portion of your portfolio that's like, ""Okay, these are my home run positions that I really think I figured out that Google's going to be great before other people have figured it out, and it's not priced in. And I'm just going to let it come up."" Okay. You could have a few of those. And you could have a few on the other side, where you're like, ""This is a fraud. I think these guys are going to be a zero."" And you could have a few of those, but then you have lots of other types of trades. On the short side, you could have expectation basis. ""Could be a great company, but they're investing a lot in their business for the next couple quarter, more than people think, and revenues are falling off a little bit. Expenses will be a little higher. And at this multiple, I think it's going to hit the stock.""You can have competitive shorts, there's a competing product coming out, this other drug company has a similar drug that's coming up, and people don't understand how similar it is, and it's going priced better. There's lot of different of trades. And you need to have a diverse portfolio of lots of different types of positions. And so, you try to minimize these exposures that either you don't have much skill at predicting, or the skill is very low, relative to your skill at other stuff. Your skill at predicting, for a typical, fundamental PM, their skill of predicting how a company is going to perform over the next quarter or two relative to similar companies, it's pretty high, if they have an investment process that's designed to do that, and they're following a pretty tight group of stocks, and they're following them very closely, really understand their business models. They should be pretty good at consistently predicting that this company's going to outperform this company for the next quarter or two, and costly reevaluating that and rotating their portfolios. Their skill of predicting the company that's going to hugely outperform over the next five years, they might have some skill with that, but it's certainly going to be lower, and it's going to have a lot of volatility in it. Patrick: In addition to the world of shorts, the other variable that seems to be important for this business model, and has changed a lot recently is interest rates. In what ways do interest rates affect this style of investing, and how do you think about them? Dmitry: In general, the higher rates are positive for a couple reasons. One, it tends to correlate with higher levels of volatility. You want some volatility. So the worst environment for us is if there's like nothing going on. If there's nothing going on, and there's very high correlation between stocks and between themes within different asset classes, it's very hard to make much money. And you don't want to run a tremendous amount of leverage during that period to compensate, because that could change. And then all of a sudden you got too much leverage in a difficult period. So that's the worst. So anything that's away from that, which our interest rates help with that, that's helpful. More volatility is helpful. Secondly, for some of the strategies like macro trading, the largest part of macro trading is trading rates. And if rates are just locked at zero, and there's no difference between the paths of various central banks, it's going to be very hard to make much money. And that's the environment that rate traders are in for a lot, and now it's kind of the opposite of that. So you have a lot of rates volatility, you have various paths for various central banks, and you could do all kinds of different trades. You could do curve trades, you could do directional trades, et cetera. There's just a lot to do. And so, that helps. From a leverage basis on equities, it doesn't really matter because you're always paying the spread, and you're always leveraged. So your spread that you pay the private broker between your long and your short doesn't change, the level of interest rate overall goes up and down, but you're just paying spread. So it doesn't really affect us from that side. Patrick: What's your view on the opportunity set in the world of private investing? Obviously, it's been another huge trend here. Venture, growth stage, more traditional private equity. What have you done in this area and what excites you, and what doesn't? Dmitry: So this is something that we started working on five years ago, that we wish we would've started 15 years ago, but we really like the strategy for a couple different reasons. Number one, it's a good strategy in its own right, even if you had nothing else, because just the trend is companies stay private longer. The trend of technology growth creating most of the value in markets, I don't think is going to change. It could certainly change this year, but I don't think it's going to change for the next 20 years. So the ability to capture that by investing in the best companies, during the best part of their growth curve, you have to invest in privacy market to do that, because now by the time they come public, they're coming public, you know, $100 million valuations in some cases. Maybe it'll go to a billion, but you certainly missed a lot.That's by itself. But secondly for us, it's super synergistic. The synergies between the public investing teams and the private, both for sourcing and diligence of the private companies, but also to help understand the companies they're investing in on the public side, and their competition that's coming down the pipe for those, and who's taking share, who's winning share, losing share, like that's super important. Tech, that's becoming more important in healthcare than other consumer in other areas as well. And there's a lot of synergies with our equity capital markets business, where we're very active participants in new issues and secondary financing. So there's tremendous amount of investment synergy there, because it's a really attractive area. The problem with it is, if hedge funds are competitive, ventures are next level, because hedge funds, at least you can compete for talent, and that's super competitive, but it doesn't matter how good you are, you can go and buy Google. Whereas in venture, you can't just go invest in snowflake, and they're private because you showed up. You need to overcome the negative selection on sourcing, which is really, really difficult. When we started like five years ago, what's going to be our edge in business plan to eventually be able to do that? Because you have to be invited into the best companies, invited to invest.And we started doing it in a few different ways. Like one, we personally started investing with lots of different early-stage venture funds so that we would be a client, not a competitor. And we would have some deal flow from following their companies, and seeing which ones were breaking out, and already having a relationship with that fund, and that manager, and that company in a lot of cases. Secondly, we started a conference where we invite our hedge fund people, and combine them with really top VCs, top founders, and put together various panels on data and healthcare research, or cryptocurrency and FinTech. And you'll have panels of publicized private guys, investors, founders, management teams. And we started that five years ago, and it's become a really big draw, and a top conference people want to go. Those few things have created a bit of an ecosystem. The third thing that's really important is you need a dedicated team. In the last couple years, we've built out a really top private team that's solely dedicated to that strategy, and then work hand in hand with the public teams. So when they're due-diligencing a company, and they want to understand the potential exits and valuations, public competitors and strategies.We can get people who are expert in that particular niche of the market from the public side, as well as from the private side and put them together, if we like it, to talk to the company, or do they really see the value that our guys can have? You kind of need all those things. I think people who are jumping into it without having an edge on the sourcing side, and without having really experienced, dedicated teams, it's very, very difficult to compete, unless you're just ... You could be in the hot market, where everything goes up over time, that's very difficult to compete in. My thought is always like, if we could bring to bear the strength of a really institutional public investing firm, with all the intelligence that that has, like we have close to 300 people in equity research. If you can combine that with really dedicated top-notch private teams, and a proprietary sourcing network. Over time, it's not going to necessarily be in day one, but over time you can really build top-notch business.",2451
149,Dmitry Balyasny - Building a Better Model,Major Influences and Future Aspirations," Patrick: In what ways was your thinking or your mind most shaped by reading Ayn Rand? Dmitry: It was certainly shaped, but my feeling like reading Atlas Shrugged when I was in college, was getting a much more sophisticated articulation of things that were in the back of my mind, where you always kind of thought like, ""Hey, looking at the world in this manner makes sense."" But you couldn't really articulate it in a philosophical and moral way. And she obviously does a fantastic job of taking that, and putting it into a coherent, logical philosophical framework. And then on top of that, the books are super fun to read. And so, you can get through a 1000-page book and not want to put it down. I became a fan of that, tried to help out, I ran an institute over time, who sponsor a large ... I think it's the largest essay contest in the country for high school seniors, with large prizes based on their essays. That's a sharp involvement. Patrick: What idea do you think she most got right? And then I'd also be curious if there's a major idea that maybe you think she got wrong. Dmitry: Not anything major that she got wrong, or at least I haven't figured it out. The major idea I think that she got right is basically that capitalism and individual achievement is not just economically the best system, but it's morally the best system, and they're morally and economically self-reinforced. That's kind of the thing that's missing in a lot of the dialogue that you hear in the press and politics. It's always trade offs. If it's done correctly, with a focus on longterm success and achievement, there's usually not much of a trade off. The right course is not necessarily easy to figure out, but if you spend time on, it's usually logical, and you can even figure it out. Patrick: You're from Ukraine originally. I'm curious what this episode of history has felt like for you as an American, obviously that lives here, but obviously vested interest and deep personal roots in that part of the world. What's it been like for the last several months? Dmitry: Yeah, I was born in Kiev, and best trade my parents ever made, which I thank them for immigrating when I was six or seven years old. It's been horrible. It's just a very sad, very, very sad situation. It's tragic that this kind of barbaric situation can occur in modern times, in Europe, in first-world countries. You don't expect this in Europe. Very sad situation that hopefully comes to a conclusion before too long. Patrick: Yeah. Amen. What, if you think about the future of BAM, most has you motivated? What are the Warren Buffett tap dancing to work phrase pops to mind? Like what are the things that, when you're doing them, you're still filled with joy around the investing business that will drive you forward? Dmitry: It's really the same things as when I started. I've always had two things that motivated me, like one wanting to be an excellent trader. And so, I'm still active in the markets, and I still get excited about interesting trades, and volatile markets. I enjoy that. And two, just wanting to build a great business, and as silly as it sounds, it takes such a long time to build a proper foundation for these businesses, for this type of business. Maybe other people are smarter than me, and were able to do it faster. It really takes, in our example, it certainly took over a decade and probably close to two decades. Now, I really feel like we have a really good foundation for building new strategies and extensions of existing strategies, with a high likelihood that we'll succeed at them over time.And that's exciting, because you're always kind of learning new stuff and figuring out you're good at this particular thing. How do you expand it to the next adjacency, and succeed at that? How does it fit in with other things that you're doing? Where can you innovate? How can you approach this problem in a way that's different from what other people have done, that might be better? And the last piece is people growth generate a lot of satisfaction for me. So like when we take somebody who went through our PM training program is now a top PM. And you remember interviewing them when they were an analyst coming through, or somebody who comes out of our scholarship program with college, and might start off in a very junior position, hopefully five-10 years down the road, they're a great analyst, or great PM, generating a lot of PM for the firm. Like that's immensely satisfying. Patrick: Yeah. It's fun to think about the career development, maybe above all else as a very rewarding avenue. As we wind down with your trader hat on, you mentioned always still interested in being good at that, getting better at it. Where does that instinct pull you today, with your investing, trading function, not the business building function, in mind? Where are you drawn to investigate or learn or participate today? Dmitry: My core is equities trade. A lot of tech in other sectors. I've traded more macro over the last few years as well. I'm more of a directional macro guy. And I like periods when there's a lot of upheaval, when there's a lot of risk off type situations. I'm drawn to that because, one, I like it and I'm good at it. But two, it's also really good diversifier for the firm. We always want to be in a position of strength. When you look at monthly numbers or quarterly numbers for people, and a lot of times they might look pretty consistent, but like what was the mark entry month? Would the alternative have been if the market didn't come back? So like 2020, if the Fed didn't intervene in March, what would your month end number had been? That type of environment is where I tend to get pretty aggressive, and try to really make a difference. When things are pretty common and everybody's doing well, I'm still involved, but I can spend a lot more time on business stuff, and try to grow the business, and recruiting and things like that, because we have 125 other teams that are doing well. Patrick: Do you have a most memorable personal trade of all time? Dmitry: I have a most memorable miss. Patrick: That works too. Dmitry: When the mortgage subprime short in '08, we were researching it, and I was really attracted to the symmetry of shorting subprime, and it made sense macro stuff that we were looking at, but we were hesitant to do it as a firm. We were much smaller, certainly wasn't in our mandate that we would ever talk to investors about that we were going to trade subprime. We didn't have the kind of internal expertise on that. And in retrospect, I should have just put it on, and if it didn't work, it didn't work. Deal with that. Didn't have enough confidence from an institutional business mindset to do that.So we invested, you know, personally with Paulson, and that then did great. And we had a great external hedge fund investment, but could have been home run for the fund and for our clients. So the takeaway from that always is, like, there's always a balance between making sure you have competency in something, and enough expertise that you should be risking your money and your client's money, and not doing willy nilly, but you have to have enough also conviction and ability to take risk when you do see the opportunity, even if it's different from something that you've done before. You might not do it at the same scale that you're doing businesses that you've been in for a long time, but you have to kind of get involved, when you see something. And so, we've tried to do a better job over the years of straddling the right balance between that. Patrick: Across the major asset categories you described at the beginning, do you have a sense for in what order they'll be affected most by data, artificial intelligence, modeling, things of that nature in the future? Dmitry: Everything becomes more and more quantitative every year. It's hard to say precisely how it's going to look 20 years down the road. So what I try to do is just make sure that we're always on the leading edge of that as much as possible. My personal view is as long as markets are made up of people where the majority of flows are discretionary, that's very hard to totally quantify that. The further out your timeframes go, the harder the quantification comes. So obviously the high frequency training firms, you can certainly quantify the millisecond trading and that works much better than people doing it and it's a great business. But the further away you go from that, if you're trying do private second best thing, and there is no data you have so it's a person and a business plan, and that's kind of an opposite end of that, you need people to understand and research and have a view. And stock picking or macro trading is kind of in between those.Of course, you have to invest in the data and automation and improving your infrastructure and giving your teams better and better tools all the time to do that. So like last year we hired over 100 people in tech, I think this year we'll probably hire 200 people in tech. There's an insatiable demand for constant tools, whether it's risk tools, trading tools, research tools, etc. So we always want to be providing that. But for the further the strategies, go from a timeframe perspective, the harder they are to kind of fully automate. Patrick: Dmitry, it's been so much fun hearing about very unique brand of investing firm. Like you said, there aren't many of them, our first chance to explore one on the show here. So I'm so appreciative of the time and insight. I ask everybody the same traditional closing question. What is the kindest thing that anyone's ever done for you? Dmitry: I'll take my parents out of it, they've done lots of kind things for me. A memorable one that really made an impression on me when I was a kid, I was doing door to door sales. I think I was 12 or 13. Fairly miserable job, door to door sales. But I was walking around with my bag of stuff that I was selling, and I wasn't selling much that particular day, this guy calls me over. ""Amazing, somebody called me over, maybe he wants to buy something."" So I run over, start showing him all my stuff. And he is like, ""No, no kid stop. Stop. I don't want to buy anything."" I like, ""Ugh."" He's like, ""But I really like to see a young person working hard,"" and he gave me $20. Patrick: Simple as that. Dmitry: And so that really made an impression on me and that kind of reinforces that there's a value in the hard work just for the sake of hard work. If you can do that over time, eventually it'll work out. Patrick: Really cool. A unique answer, I haven't had one quite like that, Dmitry. Real blast, thank you so much for your time.

150,Henry Ward - Transforming Private Markets,Introduction," Patrick: My guest today is Henry Ward, co-founder and CEO of Carta. Started in 2012, Carta helps companies and investors manage their cap tables, equity plans, and ownership. Last year, they launched CartaX, a platform for private companies and their employees to access secondary market liquidity. Our discussion is a detailed exploration of private market infrastructure, and Henry's views on building and enduring business. Please enjoy my conversation with Henry Ward.",102
151,Henry Ward - Transforming Private Markets,Carta's Origins," Patrick: So Henry, where to begin this conversation? Carta is such an interesting business, because it is effectively infrastructure for other companies, a topic that I love and obviously you love too. Maybe the right place to go is all the way back to the beginning and whatever the first insight or founding risk, however you want to frame, the first key mental moment for you around this business and how it came to you. I'd love to hear that story and then build on it, because it's been quite a 10 year run. Henry: Thanks for having me. I would break Carta's beginning or origin into two parts. One is the observation that started it, and then the solution that we started building. And the observation was we live in this weird world where you have hyper liquidity in the public market. So much so that people are trying to buy my machines closer to the exchanges. We talk about nanosecond liquidity. And then the private markets, there's zero. And everything's done in paperwork. There's zero liquidity. To invest in two founders in a garage takes 30 days, tons of paperwork, $20,000 in legal fees, and so on. And so that dichotomy was an interesting observation for us. And our explanation for why this dichotomy existed was that there was no infrastructure for private companies and private financial infrastructure, that all the infrastructure had been built for public securities, but nothing for private. And it was still trapped in contract law, which meant it was still trapped in paperwork. So that was observation one. Solution was: well, how do you build the infrastructure for private markets so that it can look more and resemble the public markets? And our idea was: could we build this database which would be, think of it as like the MLS but of private assets. I just wanted to know what everybody owned. And if we had this database, that would become the central clearinghouse for all private market securities.And we could build an exchange on it, we could build liquidity, we could do all kinds of things on this database. Think of it if you're familiar with the depository trust corporation in the public world, that what we were building, is the DTC of private markets. The hard part of course is how do you get people to tell you what they own and get those assets? Let's build a really easy and simple way for issuers to issue stock certificates, issue securities, online via email, just like you would send money with PayPal 20 years ago, we're going to send securities via email with eShares. We're now called Carta. Back then we were called eShares. And in exchange for that service, they tell us who owned what. So if I issue Patrick 100 shares of ACME Inc stock, I now know Patrick owns 100 shares. I record that in my database, we build this database. And that's what we launched in 2014. To really understand us, we're just a transfer agent for private markets, but now we've assembled a couple trillion of private market assets in the database that we could now turn into the infrastructure for private liquidity. That was the origin story of how we started. Patrick: I love the idea of how to solve the problem, which also makes me wonder how you thought about commercializing that solution. So we'll get to the end game or the current game, which is what's enabled by this big infrastructure, which is really interesting. But how did you first think about turning this into a business? And what the original product would be, how to sequence products. You've done a lot of that now. So it'd be nice for you to describe those, but also explain how you decided what to start with, which I'm always interested by. Henry: Our business model when we started was we charged $20 per issued stock certificate. Our competition was FedEx. So as all early customers are, they're friends of the CEO, the friends of the founder. So I called all my friends. I said, ""Hey, don't pay FedEx $30 to ship your stock certificate to you. Pay us 20 to do it online."" And that was the business model for the first two years. And then after we got enough traction on it we then changed it to a subscription model. Because what we realized was the real value was not issuing the securities. The real value is tracking it in the cap table. And that's what people wanted, because we were effectively building the cap table bottoms up by issuing the securities. And so in 2016 we moved to a subscription based model and became a very traditional SaaS business. But it's one of these great lessons I tell all founders, that the business model you started with may not be the business model you end up with. And that was classic for us.",1023
152,Henry Ward - Transforming Private Markets,Why Private Markets are So Different to Public Ones," Patrick: Maybe go back again and give us a little bit of a history lesson of why there was such a large divergence between the infrastructure in public and private markets. The point about colocation in and public markets versus pen and paper still in privates definitely resonates, but that must have been the result of something. And there seems like there's a lot of friction that still exists in private markets relative to public. Obviously you can't hit a button and buy. Why is this the case? What are the historical touch points that matter that got us to here? Henry: It all goes back to the 1933 securities exchange act, where they bifurcated securities that were registered, as the term, for public securities, that are available for public consumption. And then unregistered securities, which are only available for private consumption, where you have accredited investor rules and you have all these regulations that you have to follow, and exemptions you have to follow. Largely to protect investors. That was the goal of the '33 securities exchange act that came out of the depression. And so part of the registered securities problem was, well, how do you make this accessible to everybody? At the time, 80 million Americans, and now over 300. And that created this wave of standardization in the public markets that created all the infrastructure that we could build around.And the private market, because there was no problem of scale, you didn't have to scale public securities back then. There might have been 50,000 people worth a million bucks or more that could actually buy private securities. It was all just kept in paperwork and contract law and became incredibly bespoke. And so you see all kinds of weird differences between private and public markets. So one example is pricing. In the public markets, price is determined by the last buyer, by the marginal buyer. In the private markets it's determined by the first buyer, the buyer that gives you a term sheet. And so that's just one example of all the differences between public and private, where they just don't work the same because of that simple act that was put in 1933. Patrick: Maybe say more about that last point and how that might change in the future. Like if it's 10 years from now, what could a price discovery process look like, especially for primary shares? Secondary shares, talking about CartaX and private exchanges a little bit later. But I'm especially interested by the funny fact that so much private equity is priced by an early bid or something. And there's not a lot of transparency. It's not really a great price discovery mechanism. How do you think that might change? It's so funny. Henry: The other corollary of having the first buyer set price is that there's no cost to waiting, because you get the same price that everybody else does. In the public markets, if you have buyers come in before you, they get better pricing because that naturally moves the price up. And that's why you see this phenomenon and this herd mentality in private markets that you don't see in the public, where lead investor comes into the term sheet, sets a price, and then everybody wants to follow. Because by definition, they get the best deal. They get the deal with the most information after everybody else has already been. They know who's going to invest. And that's why you see massive momentum into all these rounds once somebody has set a price. But there's nothing happening until that happens. I think what you'll see in the private markets as they mature and you see more bidders come in, used to be in the gross markets, just in the last couple of years, there were like seven people that really mattered. There's Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Growth, D1, Tiger Global. There was like seven bidders in this market that really mattered.And as you start to see more bidders come in, you'll see more efficient price discovery. Today the way that I would raise capital is I go up and down Sand Hill Road, I'd collect hopefully half a dozen to 10 term sheets, and then I would manually create the auction process. I think what you'll see is if you have 20, 30, 40, 50 potential bidders, you now start to automate this. And CartaX, which is our liquidity platform, is building out the ability to create options for primary stock. Of course, all this stuff is different. Because one of the great things that the public markets did is they standardized on common stock. In the private world there's a lot of structure, so it's more complicated on how you set up these bids. But I think that's where the world's heading. And if you look at why private market valuations have gone up so much, is the last couple years a lot of the large growth and crossover funds like Tiger Global basically saw this price discrepancy between there's eight bidders in the late stage growth market and there's an infinite number of marginal bidders in the public market. And so you're always going to have higher pricing in the public market because there's more buyers available. And so they were trying to build an index fund effectively on late stage private growth to arbitrage the difference between seven buyers in the growth market, private growth market, and infinite number of buyers in the public market. Obviously that's changed a lot recently, but that was the strategy. Patrick: What about this mission animates you still 10 years into the journey? So if you go to the website it says equity for all. And I think this idea of making legible the private cap tables of the world, which allows for infrastructure and exchanges and all this other great stuff, I want to make sure I understand the core motivating force behind you and behind the company. So what is the end state that you're trying to affect by virtue of building these products and this brand? Henry: So we have this historical world view that labor compensation really started with indentured servitude, and it started with feudalism, and it progressed over time. A lot of changes are made, including no more child labor and all these types of things. Labor compensation and how labor materialized and different economies has changed over time. And we're currently in this era that I'll call the payroll era, where we rent our time for money. I think the next era of labor compensation is going to be an ownership one. And sort of the old adage that the future is here is just not evenly distributed. I think the future is in tech right now, where if you're a tech worker today of course you get equity in the company you work for. You get put on a payroll system to pay your rent, and then you're put on an equity system to participate in the upside of the company you're building. That has not expanded outside of tech very much, but it's starting. We're seeing this, for example, in private equity. I think in five years, seven years, if you work for a PE backed company, you will automatically get equity in that company you're working for, just like tech. That trend is already starting. I think you're starting to see it in movies now, where people like Zendaya are giving equity out in the films.And the entertainment industry is moving from a royalty model to an M&A model where you create a movie, build a cap table on that movie, and then sell it to a streamer. So you're starting to see pockets of this happen. You can see Hamdi at Chobani who gave equity to all of his employees, including the dairy farmers. So you're seeing this start to expand. Our mission is twofold. One is to make it so much easier. So that when you start a new job, you're going to get on a payroll and an equity platform, which couldn't have been true before 2014. I think 20 years from now, Patrick, it will feel weird. People won't understand how we went to go work for a company and all we got was cash. So that's part one. Part two is, once all these people have equity, you have to give them the ability to get liquidity. And the public markets isn't the answer for all companies. And so that's really the part two of the thesis, is how do we create liquidity for these companies that will stay private? It's a one-two play for us over the next 20 years. Patrick: Say a bit more about liquidity and your efforts to create that world, maybe starting with the frictions or the barriers, the regulatory problems. Why is it that pick your random late stage, very highly valued startup, and some employees that's been working there for eight years, most of their wealth is tied up in some private stock. Why is it that it's traditionally been such an illiquid hard thing to manage that wealth versus if you owned some shares of the public company that you work for it's very easy? Henry: 10, 20 years ago in tech, going public was the way that you got liquidity. And companies went public a lot sooner than they used to. I mean, Amazon went public, I think, at $200 million market cap. Now you can't imagine that today. The timeframe from starting a company and going public was much shorter, and the bar was much lower. Going public was the form of liquidity. And there was this ethos that I think venture and private markets created over the last 20, 30 years that nobody got liquidity until everybody got liquidity. So IPO was the moment of liquidity for everybody. And in fact, there was this view that employees selling before IPO was a vote of no confidence in the company. Fast forward to this decade, I think what has changed is, because companies are going public later, some companies are just not going public at all. Employees are starting to question this idea of, ""Why would I go join this company for a lottery ticket on going public which may or may never materialize?""And companies are starting to solve this employee question by offering liquidity pre-IPO, often through us. For example, last year we paid out $7 billion in secondary liquidity to employees. Employees took $7 billion off the table. Prior to that, the year before in 2020, was 2 billion, and the before that was 600 million. So it's starting to happen quickly. And I think we're getting to an inflection point where the best companies offer liquidity, and they put it as part of their compensation package. And we do this. I'll do the employee pitch for Carta. Hey, come to Carta because we get great benefits. You get cash, you get stock options, and you get biannual liquidity here. Which if you go work for that other private company, you won't get liquidity. You're just hoping for a public exit. And I think the more that happens, the more companies will have to follow suit. And I think we're at that inflection point where companies are starting to have to do this to attract a talent.",2355
153,Henry Ward - Transforming Private Markets,CartaX and Private Market Liquidity," Patrick: I remember reading about CartaX when it was first announced or posted online several years ago, and thinking, ""Wow, what an interesting way to sit on top of the cap table infrastructure that you've built to now provide a real secondary exchange for private markets, and the possibilities that might unlock."" How would you grade yourself so far? Maybe describe CartaX. I think I kind of just have described it in its basic terms, but I'll let you describe it how you see it. And I'd love to hear how you think it's gone. Are you satisfied with the scale of it? What have been the lessons or the challenges you've learned building something notoriously hard to build? Because a huge defacto one doesn't exist like the NASDAQ or the NYSE or something like this for this market. Henry: We're definitely in the new market creation business. One question to ask is how you define a new market. And our definition is anything where you've made a way for money to exchange hands that hasn't happened before. One example of that is having cap tables. We weren't the first cap table provider. We were the first cap table provider to charge companies. And as an example, in CartaX we're the first exchange where we're charging buyers and sellers commissions to trade and provide crossing trades for them as a service. These things are really hard to get going. But when they go, they accelerate very, very quickly. If I were to grade ourselves, I'd give us a B minus on CartaX. I think we're attracting a lot of supply, and now we're building up the demand side of the equation. All marketplaces start this way. So if you're an investor looking at marketplace companies, all marketplaces start with this thesis that there's hidden embedded demand that you can't see. And then the marketplace has somehow figured out how to unlock supply.So if you look at Airbnb, there's embedded demand that people wanted to sleep on people's couches, and then Airbnb figured out how to unlock that supply and get people to do it. And the same for us. I think we have figured out how to unlock supply. I think companies are coming to us at scale. We run 20 liquidity events a month these days to unlock supply and create liquidity on their cap tables. The challenge now is, as supply starts to rise, every marketplace has this question. How do you then have demand rise as well? And it's always that balancing act. And I think we're in the demand side of this equation, how do we attract more investors to CartaX so that they can start buying into these pre-IPO liquidity trades? Patrick: Maybe just describe the nature of supply and demand in this situation in as much detail as you can. So what is the supply? Maybe even like with specific examples. Where does it come from? Like why does it come to CartaX? And then so far where's the demand coming from, and where do you hope that it's coming from in, say, two years? Henry: Today how supply works is a company will come to us and say, ""Carta, CartaX, we want to run liquidity. Can you help us?"" And we'll hopefully say yes. The company gives us the rules of the stock market. So one of the advances of CartaX is, in the public market there's one stock market rule set by the SEC, and everybody abides by those rules. And there's two exchanges that have their own nuances on top of those rules. In CartaX, we view it as the company gets to set their rules. So they get to set what the total available float is, who's allowed to sell, who's allowed to buy, how much people are allowed to sell and buy. They configure the entire parameters, their own personal stock market.So they'll come to us and say, ""Here's what we want to set up. Employees can sell 20% of their invested options. Nobody can sell more than a million bucks,"" et cetera. We'll set that program up for them. And then we'll find buyers that they approve. And those buyers then bid on that supply. Most of the buyers today are institutional crossover funds. So it's all the people you'll think in late stage growth we've talked about and that you'll see. What will happen is the sellers will then put in bid their limit orders. How much they want to sell, at what price on the sell side. The buyers will come in and put in their limit orders, how much they want to buy and at what price. And then we'll find a clearing price that clears the most trades. So everybody gets the same price. This is a periodic auction-based market, not a continuous trading market. And so everybody gets that same price that clears the most shares.One of the challenges that we have is that, in the public world ... I hate this term. It's so derogatory ... but smart money and dumb money model of, who's the smart money, they go first. And then dumb money follows. I prefer to say price setters and price takers. One of the challenges in the private markets is there's many, many price takers. There're very few price setters. There's very few firms that know how to price a private company. And on the employee side, they don't know how to price it either. And so one of the challenges that we're having is: how do you set price when there's so few price setters? And in fact, many of the price settlers aren't on CartaX because they're the ones that are out finding founders. We attract more passive capital versus the active capital. And that's one of the things we're trying to think through. Patrick: What about the extreme version of this where non-institutional ... that core group of institutional crossover expert price setter type investors on the demand side are driving a lot of the action on CartaX? Do you think that's possible? What restrictions are there that would prevent, say, the same retail crowd that buys and sell in public markets from doing the same for Stripe share, or shares in private markets or something like that? Henry: Today it's a lot of institutional driven. Finding alpha in the public markets today is really, really hard. And so they're all moving into the private markets to find alpha. And finding alpha in the private markets is much easier. There's a lot there. Right now we only allow institutional investors to trade on CartaX. But my hope is, in two years, to your question, we'll allow credit investors. And then I hope in five to 10 years we'll find a way for retail, for everybody to participate. We're working a lot with the SEC. We have a policy team that's working on amending the credit investor rule to be not a net worth based or financial mean space metric or threshold, but rather an education qualification. So you can basically test into being an AI. And if we can get that passed, we almost had it passed with the previous administration. We're working through it with the current one, but if we can get that passed, that will wildly open up private markets to 300 million Americans. And we're really excited about that. Patrick: Why do you think there's more alpha in private markets? What's the evidence for that or how does it manifest? Henry: There's less competition from buyers where, as I said, there's seven institutional buyers that will buy in the private markets. So it's easier to find stuff that's overlooked. In the public markets, so many things are scrutinized. It's hard to find stuff that's completely overlooked. And then I think in private markets, what's really interesting is if you're asset manager, you believe in efficient markets, and you believe in efficient portfolios, and your job is really to understand the world as a Gaussian distribution and allocate correlations correctly. That is your job. And you believe the world is normally distributed.We know the stock market isn't completely normally distributed. It's got a fat tail on the downside. But it's close enough. And it's so close that we can create options and derivatives, and all kinds of financial mathematics that work in the public markets. Private markets, especially in venture are not normally distributed. They're power law. The best companies win it all. And most companies never make it. If you want to find power law, you can't find that in the public markets, you can only find it in the private and everybody wants to torque their portfolio to have a power law piece to it. And that's why I said there's alpha in the private markets. If you can find and take advantage of that power law, you have huge, huge returns. Patrick: It's interesting the studies of the public markets that show long term that power law thing exists because a small group of winners drives the outcome for the whole market. But in the near term, obviously it looks pretty distributed. Obviously very, very different for private companies. With that in mind, how is Carta the business mapped onto the success of its customers? Or is it not? Because if your customer effectively is that power law distributed private market, or startup to begin sounds like bleeding into private equity and much more broad in the future.But historically I think you've grown on the back of the startup world and economy. Are you tied to the success of the underlying companies in any way? How have you thought about that, that you exist in that world? You serve that world. How do you tie your own fate to their outcome? Henry: There's two parts to how we grow with our customers. So one is our pricing model on the cap table product is basically predicated on we don't have seats. What we do is line items on the cap table, which conclude every time you add an investor, you get a new line item. Every time you hire an employee with auction grants, you get a new line item. So as these companies grow and raise more money and hire more employees, we grow with them and they pay us more. It's absolutely true. We see it. Vast majority companies don't grow and then in any individual cohort, but then a handful of these companies grow for everybody else. And we average out at roughly 120% net dollar retention, but you could see the power law dynamic happening in a cohort by cohort basis. We just get the law, large numbers by cohort, which is great for us. So we grow in a more normal distributed way. The second thing is we build a lot of products on top of the cap table. One of the criticisms of investing in eShares slash Carta in the early days was market size.How big is the market for cap tables? That's what every investor said to us. The investors that invested in us didn't see us as a cap table company, they saw cap tables as a wedge suit. Not just liquidity, but all kinds of other things that you could build on top of the capital structure of a company. The cap table is what gave us optionality. And I would say now we've got eight, nine different products that we sell into the venture ecosystem. And one of the things we look at when we think about what new products to sell, to build, the curse of optionality that we have, which we have so many options to go after is we ask this question, what gets easier and what gets harder to build? And so some things, if we wait, actually get easier, because we get more network effect, we get more critical mass, et cetera. Some things actually get harder if we wait, because competitions coming in because encompassing gets stronger if we don't change behavior, et cetera. And that's how we decide what to do first and what to do second, what gets easier to do if we don't wait. That's a big piece of it is adding new products to sell into our customer base.",2592
154,Henry Ward - Transforming Private Markets,Management Philosophy," Patrick: How do you make those kinds of decisions faced with an infrastructure that, like you said gives you optionality, enables you to build other stuff? How do you decide what's a good idea and what's not? So I'll leave it at that. I mean, it just seems like when there's lots of options. Sometimes it's very difficult to know what to focus on. So as a manager of a business now abstracting away from the specific problems you're solving, what do you think are the right ways for other entrepreneurs to think about that problem of where to focus? Henry: I took something from our friend, Mark Andreessen where he talked to me about Andreessen Horowitz. There's no bad ideas. It's only timing. And if you have that belief system, he'll walk you through this history of ideas that happened that were before their time, but then actually ended up being a good idea. I can do it for [Webend] versus Instacart, but the Andreessen people can do it for the like last 150 years. So we've taken that. What's so great about that model is the question isn't what's a good idea, what's a bad idea. The question to it comes is now the time for this idea. And that's such a different way to think about investment decisions. I love that framework. We're not investors, we're operators. So we have our own framework, which is there's no bad ideas, the question is which aperture you look at for this idea. So if you're looking at an aperture saying, ""Hey, we're trying to solve this one problem for a user. It feels like we should do this for this user."" If that aperture is correct, when you're a product manager focused on your user and the user wants feature X, we should do that. But then if you look at it through a different aperture, let's say what is core to our mission over the next 10 years that feature may not actually be important to us. And we're both right.So the question is which aperture do we look through? I'll give you one really good example. If you talk to some of our CEOs that are customers, some of them don't like to give vesting email reminders to employees. This is a really weird one. But they don't like it because they don't employees worried about equity. It's also sometimes they don't want employees if they leave to know that their options can get exercised. There's some weird dynamics that happen with some companies and investing email reminders for employees. So if you look through the aperture of what do I do to make my customer happy? You might say, ""We should turn that off if a customer wants that."" If you look at through the aperture of our goal is to normalize equity as a means of compensation and educate the world about equity, we absolutely would send everybody vesting reminders and teach them about how important it is that they exercise their options. And both are correct answers. The question is which aperture do we want to look through today? And that's how we look at everything is what's the right aperture to look through a decision and then make a decision through aperture? And my job as a CEO is not to opine on yes, no versus good ideas, bad ideas, my job is to help the executive team to figure out what's the right aperture for decision-making. Patrick: There's this great idea, that idea of 1 of N versus N of 1 companies that I think I first became enamored with through David Haber, another mutual friend of ours, also at Andreessen. And I think he might have credited you with this model. Maybe talk about that concept a little bit and whether it also applies to this product, this decision framework, not just at the company level, but down at the feature level. Henry: I am a huge fan of the 1 of N versus N of 1 framework. And I just have to give credit, I probably talk about it more than anybody else because I'm such a disciple, but this actually came from Arjun at Tribe Capital who you may know. He told me this framework and I just ran with it. So an N of 1 business is one where the market structure allows for a monopolistic effect where there can be one and one winner. The N of 1 winner. A one event market is one where there's lots of competition. You almost think of it like Peter Thiel's competition is for losers, right? He has a very black and white view of the world. There's either perfect competition or there's monopoly and there's nothing in between. And we subscribe to that view. Our job is to never enter 1 of N markets. Never enter anything where the end state of this marketplace has to be one with multiple competitors and only enter markets where we have a real chance at becoming the N of 1 player. And that actually makes it tricky because when you enter new markets to be an N of 1 player, by definition, you have to go to relatively small markets because large markets are really hard to become an N of 1 player. It takes a lot of time. You have to have the scale to take over these N of 1 markets. Like Amazon is still not N of 1, but boy, are they heading that direction. That is the balancing act where the investors that invest in Carta, the criticism might be, ""Hey, they only go after small markets."" The bullish case is, ""Well, hey, but they win all these markets. Each time they win a new market, it gives them optionality to build on top of that market and go into something bigger."" And so far we've been able to execute against that strategy. Patrick: What are some of the key principles of how you run the company that map back onto that idea of N of 1 market company, whatever? What is different do you think about running a company that, that explicitly is the goal or the strategy is to just be in markets that they can dominate? Henry: Yeah. I used to have this conversation a lot with candidates that I was trying to recruit. Back in the early days, especially, I'd compete against Instacart and I'd compete against MongoDB, and Gusto, and payroll companies and house tech companies. What I would always tell them is I would say, ""Hey..."" When I had a candidate that had an offer from a payroll type company and an offer from me and they were trying to figure out the two, and I would say to them, ""Hey, there's two types of businesses that you can pick from. One is a business like this payroll company we're competing with that has line of sight to..."" At that time, a billion in revenue seems crazy. Now, I would say 10 billion in revenue. But they had a line of sight to a billion in revenue when they were a series A or B company. The question was, could they out execute? There's a billion dollars easily available in TAM for a payroll company or for a database company. The question is can they just execute better than incumbents and get there and build a better, faster, cheaper product?For us, we've never seen line of sight to a billion in revenue or 10 billion in revenue in any one product line. We're like that company that sort of has a machete and we're hacking our way through a foggy jungle, and we're building the path as we go. The first type of company, I would call an execution company. They know exactly what to do. The question is, can they organize a team and execute against that plan better than anybody else? For us, we don't know what to do. We have to keep innovating and finding new markets because in any existing market, we're going to run out of oxygen and we've raised venture capital. We've raised too much money to just flatline. And so we constantly have to innovate and find new paths. And the question is which company do you want to work for? High performance execution team or an innovation discovery company where we're constantly beating our own path? And for some employees, it was better to go to an execution company. I would say everybody that comes to Carta is here for the journey, not the destination, because we don't know what the destination is. Patrick: Let's just imagine there was two classes of five amazing job candidates, a designer and engineer, whatever the lineup was. We could run a sliding doors experiment. So that five-person group went to payroll company in one world and they went to Carta in another world. In what ways are those two paths in the actual experience of doing the work the most different? I understand the concept, but in practice, like in literal terms, what is different about those two paths or those two kinds of companies and therefore those kinds of employees and how they operate? Henry: I would say that the experience of the employee is a top down versus bottoms up management style. If you're an execution company like a database company or a payroll company, they know exactly what to do. The roadmap is defined from the top. Execution is measured and progress measured, OKRs, all this kind of stuff. So they're given the thing. Here's what you got to go do, and you just have to go do it. It's great and you'll do it really well, and all that kind of stuff. I think employees that come out of those companies become great executives. Because how do you become a great executive? I call it deterministic management. You know exactly what to do. You have a roadmap, you have a plan, and your job is to operationalize that plan. And they become great executives. If you work for a company like ours, we have no idea what to do. It's very bottoms up. We intentionally organize that the best ideas come from the bottom. And my job is not to actually make decisions on what to do because I'm not close enough to the customer, to the markets, to all these things. My job is to give people the framework that they make the decisions on what to do.So for example my framework is only N of 1 markets. We only do new market creations, so we're not going to try to invade an existing market, we're going to find a way for money to exchange hands that hasn't happened before and make that true. I give all the frameworks for how to make these decisions, but you really push decision-making to the bottom. And it feels like for employees is it's scrappy, it's exciting. It's also incredibly chaotic and they have no idea what's going on half the time. And I would say the best thing, if you want to be a founder, Carta is the right place to do this. If you want to be an executive, this is a terrible place to learn to be an executive. But if you want to be a founder, this is how you do startups. We have the Carta cartel, we affectionately call it, early stage employees that have left to do startups, and there's a dozen of them already. We breed founders. That's what we do here. Patrick: What do you do to make that so true? What is the empowerment that's happening? What is being pushed down, I guess, to that bottom that allows that experience to happen for them, deliberately from you and leadership team? Henry: A big part of it is roadmaps and decision making is pushed all the way down to the people that matter. So we're very good at allowing experimentation to take place. I'll give you a very practical example of this, which is really hard, hard to figure out. Let's say a director level or senior director, something, their project tried a new product or new thing, and it didn't work out. And now their performance review is coming up. We do a four point rating. Four is the best, one is the worst. Do you give them a two because it didn't work out or do you give them a four because they tried. That question is it seems so simple, but it's such a fundamental question because if you give them a two, nobody will ever take risks because they'll only do things they know that work. And if you give them a four, people will want to take risks because they know that they'll get rewarded for that effort. We're a company that gives fours. Most companies won't. If you ask most companies, what do you do when somebody tries something and they fail at it? They'll say, ""Well, we're an outcome-based company. Results matter."" We're an input based company, not an output based company. The results will be the results. What we question is do we do it the right way? Patrick: I had an interview with Frank Slootman from Snowflake recently. Obviously, he's sort of like the prototypical hard charging, intense focused leader and manager. His style is sort of fascinating to me. And obviously that's not the only style that works. How would you characterize your style of leadership and management, which are distinct, obviously, separate things. How are you as a leader and a manager? How hard do you push people, and what's your philosophy on this given that you yourself have been a startup, you have to move fast. Henry: I'm a huge fan of Snowflake and Slootman. I mean, the numbers they put up are just... I mean, it's like the Steph Curry of B2B SaaS. It's just amazing. We all aspire to execute the way that team does. I would say though, and maybe this is why we're not a Snowflake, but I'm the opposite of Frank Slootman. Literally, the opposite. As one example, I don't push hard because I believe that people will work harder for themselves than they will for anybody else, including me. This is really such a subtle thing. Most CEOs, if somebody does something well, they'll say good job with approval. I'll say congratulations because they didn't do it for me, they did it for themselves. And good for them that they were successful at it. I give them the credit that they gave themselves for doing a good job rather than making it paternal. I also do something else. I do this exercise with execs where especially newer execs that are promoted or recently started working for me. This is exercise. I'll ask them, ""Hey, what's the difference between working for the CEO and working for everybody else you've ever worked for in your career?""I'll usually get business school answers like, ""You have to be collaborative. You have to be cross-functional,"" all this kind of stuff. I say, ""All of that is true, but the biggest difference is it's the first time in your career, you work for someone that knows less than you do."" I'll pick on my CFO. When you are the director of finance working for the VP of FDNA, that VP became VP because they did your job and they did it well. I always say, ""It must be so disappointing. You spent 25 years to work your way up the ladder, building your career to finally get to the C-suite and work directly for the CEO, and you find out he's an idiot. He knows nothing about what you do. You can't get any help from this guy or gal. And so your job has to be, to tell me what to do."" That's such a difference from the hard charging CEO where like, ""I know best. I've done all this. I'm in charge."" I tell my C-suite, ""You need to tell me what to do, because you've done this way more than I have. This is my first CEO gig."" Patrick: What circumstances make you your toughest? What's happening at the company or what behavior or opportunity brings out the hardest charging version of your leadership style? Henry: I think the hardest charging version of my leadership style is when I go into micromanagement. I'm a big fan of extremes. There's complete competition, perfect competition or monopoly. I kind of view there's autonomous management, let people do what they want to do and stay out of their way or micromanage. But don't live in the middle and it comes down to confidence. So if you have confidence in the executive or product manager or whoever it is that you're working with, let them run. Be there, help them give frameworks, give ideas, be a thought partner to them, treat them as a peer in this, but let them run. This whole trust but verify thing, just trust. See that it works. And if you trust them, they'll come and tell you when things aren't working. They'll tell you when you should be worried, but leave them alone.If you don't have confidence in them, micromanage them incessantly because management and all this stuff is an apprenticeship. They really need your help, and not just from afar, they need you shoulder to shoulder, desk to desk with them helping them. I take two sides and 90% of the time, I trust and let people go. And then the 10% of the time I'll sit and I'll invest with them. And if they come out the other side of that micromanagement investment, which micromanagement, it's a bad word, but I think it's a great thing. I think it means you care and they come out better and now you trust them. That's fantastic. And 50% of the time that'll happen. 50% of the time, you can't help them. But now you know. You made the effort and you can figure out what to do after. Patrick: How do you know when something, especially with this bottom up style of building and sort of pushing responsibility to the edges, when something is wrong and someone at a high level needs to stop an initiative, shut down a product, eliminate a team, the hard parts of sort of pruning what's not working from the top down, how do you do that? In this way of company building? Henry: It's really hard. And it comes down to culture is often overused term. But I would say I hate to put everything on culture, because there's so much more to organization building than culture. But I would say in this one, culture matters a lot. One of the old management maxims I hate is don't come to me with a problem without a solution, which is the dumbest management thing I've ever heard because then you don't get any of the problems that don't have solutions, which is the ones you really want to know about. If anything, I'd go the other direction. Don't come to me when you have problems that have solutions because you've already figured out, come to me with the ones that you don't have solutions for, so I can help. And instilling that into the culture of... My job is, I'm a servant leader. My job is that when you have problems, you don't know what to do, come to me because I might be the person that can help you. And ingraining that culture and that feeling all the way down the leadership stack to the support analyst that goes, ""I have a problem with a customer they're unhappy, can I escalate that because I don't know what to do,"" that is critical to uncovering problems in the organization. Patrick: What is your favorite example of something that just didn't work, that seemed really promising and you pursued or whatever got to some stage or development or even as a live product. And ultimately it was just a bad idea and a bad mistake. I love these stories of learned failure. So what's your favorite example of that in Carta's history? Henry: I started CartaX too early. I would say this is actually the third swing I've taken at creating a liquidity product. And I've done it twice before. Both times objectively failed. And part of it was me noticing, but mostly it was the team realizing, ""Hey, given the constraints and how we're going to measure progress..."" And they set it up. It wasn't, ""Hey, I consider success A, B, and C."" They're like, ""Henry, here's how we think of a success, A, B and C."" And I'm like, ""That sounds reasonable to me. Let's run with it."" And then over time as they kept reporting, they weren't getting to A, B and C. It was really painful because we believed, the team believed. It's so hard for a team to admit failure especially to the boss. And it's so hard for me to watch them suffer as they're trying to get this thing off the ground, and those things are really tough, but for most part, I would say 90% of that team stayed with Carta. It wasn't like we disbanded the team. That team was a failure. It was like they were heroes for trying, and that's the most important thing. I have this, another management thing. If a team does a bad job, you should be upset. And I have this rule with my execs. You should never show that you're upset, full stop. There's no excuse for it, and it's because once you show you're upset for any reason, people won't want to tell you things, and it's hard. It is hard. When you see really stupid things happen, it's hard not to get upset about it. I can do 99 things right and be cheerful, positive, optimistic and that one time I'm upset about something, that's what everybody will remember. Patrick: So what do you do instead of getting upset? Like, let's say someone does a terrible job or just a lazy job or something that is clearly not up to the standard and you are upset in a literal sense, what do you do instead of showing that? Henry: I get curious. So the big question for me to figure out, is if I feel like this was not a great job, what does the employee think? Do they think they did a good job? Do they think they did a bad job but don't want to admit it? Do they think they did a bad job and now they're going to tell me they did a bad job. All of that is such important questions because depending on how the employee feels, it decides my solution. If the employee think they did a good job, I have a different problem. I have a expectations problem and I have to find out why this employee thinks this was great and why I don't, and I could be wrong. Maybe I'm missing something and they actually did a good job, but I just don't know it. So it's a discovery process to figure out why the employee thinks they did a good job. If the employee thinks they did a bad job but they're being defensive about it, that's a very different problem. That's not about the project. That's about the employee. Why is this employee feeling defensive? So for me, it's an entire discovery process and I'm sure the hard-charging CEOs that are listening to this go like, ""Henry's kind of a wuss. He doesn't force the issue."" I'm the opposite of that. I'm a discovery, curiosity type leader, not a hard-charging execution leader. Patrick: Then I'm curious how you spend your time. If I were to come shadow you for two weeks or something or a month, what would I see you doing? Henry: I think you'd probably see me do two things. One is a lot of external stuff. I try to focus helping the company on the outside. I leave a lot of the operational detail to my exec team. I think you'd see me do a lot of that. And then the second is I hope you would see me do a lot of positive mentorship. Meeting with one-on-ones with employees, helping them think through problems. Meeting with teams, helping them think through problems. Doing round tables, getting advice. I mean, one of the things I love about Andy Grove's book first chapter is he spends 12 hours sitting in meetings all day and then at the end of the day makes one decision, and he is like, ""All that mattered is I get that decision right."" I very much feel like my job is to mentor, help and then occasionally make a decision and make sure that decision is a good one. And so you'll see me getting a lot of information. We were just talking about this with Marc Andreessen and his fire hose of information. I try to set that up for myself too.",5330
155,Henry Ward - Transforming Private Markets,Product Philosophy," Patrick: Maybe say a word of what you've learned about... You've given a lot of these interesting management concepts. I'd love any interesting, similar concepts on product you've got now beyond cap table, a number of different things that you do for your customer. What does great product, especially in the world of software, mean to you? What are the characteristics of a great product for Carta, but even more generally? Henry: There's this great image I shared with all my product managers. I'll try to describe it, hopefully, in words. There's two styles of product management if you want to build a car and the first one was this, iteration of how to get to a car in pieces. You start with a chassis and then you start with a wheels and then you start with a steering wheel and then you put in a steering wheel and you put in seats and at the end of this, you get a car. Then the other style of product management was you start with a skateboard and then a scooter. Then you put a stick on it, it becomes a scooter. And then it becomes an electric scooter. And then it becomes a go-kart and then you get to a car. I love that one because what's so powerful about that is, the first version of this product has utility in the second style, but not in the first. And so we talk a lot about... Everybody wants to build a car. We know that's what we want to do, but that's not the hard part in product management. The hard part in product management is the path to the car and how do you provide utility along the way? This is one of the things that big companies get wrong a lot, because they have so many resources. They're like, ""We'll just go straight to the car. We'll build a chassis, we'll build this.""We have executives that know how to operationalize this. We have a roadmap and a plan, but if you're in a discovery company where you're not sure what this car is going to look like, you have to start with utility early. And this is why it works really well for founder-led companies, because that's what venture is like. Nobody gave me a billion dollars to start Carta. I started with 200K and then a million and a half. And each way I had to show utility, I had to show something that at that stage of the company was sustainable, we could build off of, and big companies don't have that. And so they do these massive projects that often fail three years in where we instill that deeply into our product teams, even now we're 2000 employees, that your job is to build a scooter first and not the chassis. Patrick: I love that. It reminds me of one of my favorite books by this guy, John Gall called The Systems Bible. And one of the principles in The Systems Bible is there's no such thing as a complex system that's just designed complex and implemented. Every complex system that works evolved from a simple system that worked first, and that really makes me think of that skateboard-scooter-car way of thinking about product. Same question for teams. Define what a great team looks like, especially given that it sounds like you are really pushing the fate of the company down onto relatively small teams at the edge of the business, not from the top down. What does a great functional team look like in your opinion? Henry: I talk a lot about this with my execs, where I have this interpersonal theory about how people talk and work together and I call it process and content. Process is how you work together. Content is what you're talking about. Most teams and management C-level execs talk a lot about content. What's the right budget here? What's the right product here? What should we do here? All of it is around the decision making and what's the right decision? And I spend a lot of time with them, especially with execs that come from bigger companies where vigorous debate is good because it gets you to the right answer. Another management maxim I can't stand is, debate is good. And what I talk to them about is what I care most about this process, how we work together, how we talk to each other. You'll give this example where two execs are arguing and not getting along and upset about something, but they ended up getting to the right decision, to the right outcome and agreeing on it.They would consider that success. I would consider that failure. I use this phrase. Friction is failure, and most people think friction is good, because it shows a healthy debate. And so to me, it's in a great exec team, works really well together and is okay if they don't get the right answer. My favorite lines that I learned about partnerships is, great partnerships work when the relationship matters more than the answer, and I think that's true for teams. How we work together matters more than the answer and we're okay making mistakes to preserve the collaboration of what we're working on together. Patrick: I like this line of questioning around aspects of the business so I'll keep going. What defines great in go-to market, whether that's marketing sales? You can tell me what matters more for Carta. What have you learned about what great means at doing this part of the company building motion really well? Henry: For us, I have a very specific answer. I don't know that I can speak for all companies, but definitely for us, we are in this, I would say, later innings transition, the moving from a single product company to a multi-product company and the platform, yes. Multi-product and I would even say multi customer, because we both sell cap table software and compensation benchmarking software to companies, but we also sell back office and fund administration to venture funds. If you look at any life cycle of a company, obviously they start with an idea and they're trying to get to product market fit. That's stage one, is trying to get to product market fit. Then after product market fit, most companies die before that ever happens. That's the first wave of death. The second wave that happens is they get to product market fit, but they can't scale effectively, and that's stage two, which is how do you scale this product that's seems to be working? A lot of companies die there, but much, much fewer. That tends to be a little bit easier. Getting to product market fit is the hardest part.And then at some point, unless your database is your payroll, you're going to run out of oxygen there, you're going to have to have a new product or a new customer, expand the market and then it becomes a multi-product, multi-customer company or platform. Vast majority of companies die there. That's where you get the single digit billion outcomes, $2 billion market cap and always will be. But if you want to get the 10, 20, 100 billion in market cap, you have to become multi-product. Being in the midst of doing it right now, that's actually really hard to do. It's harder than I would've thought. And building a GTM motion that becomes the pipelines of distribution where we can invent a new product, we can acquire through M&A, Corp Dev a new product and then push that through the lines of distribution to our customers in a scalable way. That's really challenging, but the teams that can do that's incredibly valuable because now, if you get a good product market fit and a lot of that can be experimented with outside, you just look at these startups, you see which one's getting traction and you buy it and you push it through your pipes. That is how you do Salesforce-level execution. Patrick: What about building those distribution pipes themselves? We definitely see this happening with lots of the best companies. Twilio comes to mind when they bought Segment. I remember being really interested in that. Salesforce obviously is a quintessential example of building great relationships with the buyer and then constantly solving more and more problems for them. That means you need the relationship with the buyer in the first place. What have you done, do you think, that's effective there that's allowed you to beat relevant competitors, even though understanding you're going after a certain type of market where you can dominate? What have you learned about building those actual relationships and those pipes? Henry: I think two things that we're learning, I definitely would not be so bold to say we've figured it out, but we're trying to. One is having a customer success organization, a CSM Customer Success Manager organization that deeply understands the customer problem set is critical. I know that sounds like a lot of business school buzzwords, but I can tell you exactly what that means. If you can figure out a customer health score, an automated customer health score, and then make sure the CSMs understand the health score and how to drive better customer health and customer health includes, not just happiness but engagement. Are they using the product? Are they getting value out of the product? All of those things. That's key one, because what you want is the customer when they do have a problem, you don't want them to quit on you. You want them to call their CSM and go, ""Hey, I don't feel like I'm getting the value out of this product. Tell me what I'm doing wrong."" That customer health metric with CSMs deeply engaged part one is the key thing.Part two is, this is unique to us, not true of all companies, but the products that we have for companies often have different buyers. Sometimes it's the same, but often it's different. Like our cap table product might be bought by the general counsel. Our 409A product might be bought by the CFO and then our Carta Total Compensation benchmarking product might be bought by the head of people. The ability to parlay one relationship into an organization, into a broader relationship where we can say, ""Hey, we should talk to your head of people because they're issuing stock options to all these new employees, but they don't know how to."" We have all the data. We can tell them what an E5 engineer at a Series B backed company should get in stock options. We can tell them that, ""Let us talk to your head of people and see if we can be helpful."" Figuring out how to navigate the organization to step two. I would say we're early days on that. I don't have the secret sauce yet. Patrick: What do you like least about managing a company that's now this size and this level of complexity? Henry: I'm a very classical Zero-to-One product founder. I'm just your typical... You ask me what gross margin is, I have to look it up on Wikipedia. You talk about, what products we should build? That's me. I love doing that stuff and I love the early stage in building new things. The worst part I would say about my job is fighting the inertia of bureaucracy that builds into a company as it gets larger. It just happens, in part because the company gets bigger and you have to, you have to have more process, you have to have more standardization, you have to tell people how to work in a way that you didn't when you were 20 people. We are now at 2,000.Partly also you have executives come in where you hire them because they know how to standardize and operationalize things at scale. And how do you work with these executives where I'm like, ""Hey, but don't make it too bureaucratic."" I'm like, ""That's what you brought me in for, to make this place pump and turn it into a machine."" And I'm like, ""But I don't want to be a machine. I want to be a garden of innovation."" How do you balance those two things? Again, everybody's correct. It's just which aperture you're looking for. If we want to be an innovation-based company, we should look through the aperture of innovation and gardening, and if we want to be an execution, like we know exactly what to do, now, go after it like sharks, we should go be that. Which aperture do we look through it today? I would say fighting the battles of bureaucracy is my biggest challenge. Patrick: What do you fear most, if that's the biggest challenge that's already there? As you think about the future of Carta, what scares you the most? Henry: Unrealized potential. The business and platform that we have is just... We have so much optionality that we're building on this. I don't know what the inverse of peeling and onion is, but the more problems we solve, the more problems we get to solve. And it's just the solution space that we can go after just keep expanding. I think the saddest thing for me might be 10, 15, 20 years I retire and I say, ""Well, we didn't realize our potential."" That's I think what keeps me going. Patrick: You mentioned data, we'll go into the specifics of how you handle data security, but the idea of data in any modern business, certainly in your kind of business, is really interesting to me. It seems like something that almost to every entrepreneur is going to have to think about, how data's flowing through their business, how they use that data to maybe feed and enhance their own products, or at least understand their customer better, in some of the ways you've described. Give any advice you can to other entrepreneurs as they think about, ""Okay, we're going to start generating some set of data by virtue of what we offer to our customer. How should they think about that as an asset, as a product, as a fuel source? What is your model for thinking about data in the modern business? Henry: I think data is super valuable, but I tell all entrepreneurs and I tell my exec team this now, any angel investing that I do, is that if your business model is predicated on data, you're going to die. That was true in the last 20 years that you could build data businesses. I don't think that would be true in the next 20 years, that data will become commoditized. You have to do something else on top of it. Just having the data is not defensible anymore. When we think about data, I think we have two strategies. One is, and this is very much a Salesforce strategy. One is, embed ourselves into a startup ecosystem or a customer ecosystem through integrations where other platforms can use our data for things that are useful to the customer. I think that's where all the value's going to be, it's not the data itself, but how do you materialize is that data in ways that create value for customers either via workflows or decision making, whatever that is. And the way that you can do that at scale is obviously we can build our own stuff, but if we can integrate with other platforms, ecosystem could build much faster than any one company can. So I believe, especially in B2B enterprise, deep integrations into the customer platform matter a lot.And then I think the second thing is when you do have this unique core data set, how do you use it to create new product areas that you couldn't do without this? And so I'll give you the example for us. We launched Carta Total Compensation last year, which is basically Radford, but real time and in the cloud. We did this because we were getting option grant information from 30,000 customers that we have for every employee in Silicon Valley that gets stock options. And we also have their salary information because we integrate with all the HRIS systems. So we can tell everybody what a E6 engineer at a Series B back company makes in stock and cash and then we can benchmark that for everybody else. It's that materialization of the data... It's not the data itself. It's the science that we put on top of it to help companies make better decisions on comp. That's the real value. And I think what has the data enabled you to do today that couldn't be done before?",3521
156,Henry Ward - Transforming Private Markets,Future of Private Markets," Patrick: Going back to where we started as we think about the capital markets structure, the whole playing field, the infrastructure, everything in private markets today, what are the biggest missing pieces, do you think, that neither Carta nor anyone else you're aware of is working on yet? If we were to have a perfect idealized, maybe it requires you describe what the perfect idealized end state of capital markets structure would be in private markets to begin. But what is missing, I guess, is the core question I have that is interesting to you? Henry: I have a very succinct answer which is, what's missing is debt. It's really funny in Silicon Valley and tech, we're equity people. We don't understand debt at all. I have all this equity in Carta as a founder, I can't get a loan for a house, and the entire world runs on debt. The entire world runs on debt, except for this one little weird anomaly in technology companies. I barely have any personal debt. Our company doesn't have debt, but we have tons of equity investors. We only understand equity. And the reason why that's true or at least one reason why that's true is that it's really hard to create debt instruments or loans when you don't know duration of liquidity, how long it's going to last. Tech companies, because we don't know when they IPO, it's impossible for banks to calculate duration and so it's very hard to figure out terms on loans. That's why debt hasn't been introduced. I think one of the really amazing corollaries that will happen is that if CartaX is able to create systematic liquidity in private markets, we can solve the duration problem. And if we solve the duration problem, then lenders can start coming to the space and employees can start getting loans for homes. They can get loans for a car. They can do all of that securitized against private stock and that, I think, will completely change the economics of venture capital. Patrick: Obviously that means CartaX might yet be the next stepping stone to unlock something more. So what's next for CartaX. If you give yourself a B minus, as you said, then obviously it's just building any marketplace is hard, but this one sounds like it's of your white whale, right? Like you said, you've tried liquidity. This is the third time and it just seems kind of obvious if you step back. Maybe I'm wrong, but it seems kind of obvious that more liquidity is generally good for price discovery for markets in general. So what's next? What are you going to be pushing on as a company to make CartaX really work? Henry: Liquidity is a tale of two stories. One is, there's incredible amounts of liquidity that are happening in this tender offer regime, where following a financing round, companies will allow excess demand of investors that couldn't get into the primary round to buy secondary stock from employees. And that's most of that $7 billion number last year comes from, and we do a ton of those. What we haven't been successful about is all the bespoke transactions. I just want to do an auction or I just want to do something else that has been slower to adopt. And so the question that we've got to ask is I think we have V1 of private market liquidity, which is a tender offer. We're doing a ton of that.And I think we have V9 of private market liquidity, and we're trying to figure out, what is V2 through V8? How do we bootstrap in? It's a little bit like my car versus scooter analogy. We built a car. Now we got to go back and go, ""What's the scooter? What's the electric scooter?"" And start building out that pathway, because I do think private market liquidity... This is one of the really fun things about CartaX. Private market liquidity is inevitable, I do believe that. Somebody is going to crack the code on this. And obviously I think we have as good a chance as anybody, if not the best chance. And so talk about things that make me fear is what if we aren't the ones that crack the code and we were right there? We were on base and we just couldn't round out the corner. That will haunt me my entire life. That's what I'm focused on. Patrick: Yeah. I love it. It's such an interesting future to imagine where this all functions with far fewer frictions for employees, for companies, for investors, et cetera. The one group we really haven't asked about is investors. You mentioned that you've started… Actually, I think Positive Sum, my investment firm just became a customer of Carta's too, and you mentioned already that now you're serving venture investors or other investors as a key new customer. What have you learned about, or from that group specifically? If you started more focused on cap tables, obviously, of which investors are a key component, what have you learned about, or from that group as you've worked with them? Henry: I'm learning that there's an explosion of emerging managers happening in the world. This may not be new news, but there's so many emerging managers that are creating funds, that are finding niches and soft spots in the market that they're filling, whether it's geographic-based because they're in Kansas City, Missouri, and they're the only venture capitalist. If you're in Missouri, to niche markets. I focus on this specific type of company or this specific sector. The second thing, they all have a similar problem. One of the things we're experimenting with is, ""Can Carta help companies not just raise capital, but help investors find companies?"" Traditionally, the idea of the intermediary, whatever the private market equivalent of as an investment banker, was really frowned upon. If you hired an investment banker to raise money, venture capitalists wouldn't talk to you. That was a negative selection bias and part of the reason was there was eight firms...I lived a block from Sand Hill Road. There's eight firms on Sand Hill Road that you just walk over to and that's who you dealt with and that's it. It was very niche. Now what's happening is the scale of venture is no longer niche. When I do angel investing and I talk to my founders, the number one question they always ask me is, ""Who should I talk to to raise my series A or my seed round?"" And when I talk to emerging managers that hire us to be fund administrators for them, and I welcome them to the platform, the number one question they ask me is, ""Hey, if you see any great companies, send them my way."" So one of the things we're really experimenting with is, ""Has venture reached the scale where we can actually help investors find companies, help companies find investors and play this matchmaking role in the ecosystem and it not be a negative selection bias?"" That's a really fascinating problem I've been talking to a lot of our customers about. Patrick: Our investment banks, speaking of that constituency, ultimately your competition? Do you think they view you as coming for their lunch? Henry: I think they're not sure what to make of us. Patrick: That's a yes. Henry: Yeah. We're very close with Goldman Sachs. They're an investor but JP Morgan just bought one of our competitors, Global Shares. They also have created a private markets trading desk. They're also doing venture loans so they're coming in. I still view them as a friend. We actually use them for CartaX as our bank. You are definitely seeing all the banks come in and they're trying to figure out what to do with private markets just like we are. So I would say today in the ecosystem, we play in that sub hundred million. Goldman won't talk to a company if they're trying to raise 20 million bucks but we will and so we're filling this niche of sub $100 million capital formation problems, but we'll see. In five, 10 years, I definitely think there'll be crossover. Patrick: What matters a lot to you that I haven't asked you about? I'm always interested in, ""What are the obvious things that I'm leaving out?"" or things that you're focused on that I haven't explored with you. Talked about a lot but what have I left out that has your interest or your attention? Henry: I think what's going to be really interesting is this public market dislocation that's happening in the private markets and how long the two differences can last. The typical adage is the private markets are three to six months behind the public markets and so this price correction that's happened in the public markets should feed into the private. We're seeing a little bit of that in our late stage public companies, but much less than you would've thought now in April, four months in, since this started and in the early stage, you're seeing it's as hot as it's ever been. I think one explanation could be, ""Just give it a couple more months, Henry, and private markets will correct across the board."" I think the other side of this is we were talking about loan duration. I'll talk about capital duration. In the public markets, there's no tied up capital. You invest, you buy it and then you sell it and people can come and go.The capital flows are instant. In private markets, they raise these venture funds on 10 year cycles and there has been so much money raised into these funds that's committed for a decade now that it could very well be that private markets continue to be hot and continue to have large valuations because all this capital needs to get deployed that's just sitting there, that's been committed for a decade, given that public markets reprice and what that will do to the IPO timeline, what it's going to do to late stage companies, all that stuff, I don't know but it'll be fascinating to see because there is a real argument... Famous last words, ""This time is different."" There is a real argument that this time is different for private capital. Patrick: Yeah. It'll be fascinating to watch. We've certainly seen little green shoots, I guess, is the wrong word. Like you said of the onion, what's the opposite of green shoots? Withing something where for companies that might have had crazy quick deals that it's taking a little bit longer. All of a sudden we can do our diligence with less crazy timeline, little things like that, but prices are still pretty exceptional, like you said, at the earliest stages. Will be a fascinating one to watch. Well, Henry I'm so interested by the infrastructure that Carta's built so far and will build in the future. I really appreciate you walking us through it. I ask everyone the same traditional closing question, ""What is the kindest thing that anyone's ever done for you?"" Henry: One of my favorite stories to tell is when Mark Andreessen led our series E and I remember having breakfast with him in Menlo Park in the morning. We were at the late stages and I gave him the terms and I said, ""Hey, Mark. If you'll match these terms for me, I'll go with you. I'd love to work with you."" We were having breakfast. He said, ""Give me till the afternoon. I'll talk to my partners and I'll get back to you,"" and so he calls me in the afternoon and says, ""Hey, can I come by your house? I want to give you a term sheet,"" and I said, ""Sure,"" so he drove by. He brought the term sheet and a Lego set for my toddler son and he gave me the term sheet at my home and I tell this to all the venture capitalists I talk to. For VCs, giving a term sheet's routine. Do it all the time. But for an entrepreneur, it's a seminal moment in their journey and I tell all the investors, ""Hey, if you have a chance to go to an entrepreneur's home and give them the term sheet, do it."" I'll never forget that moment. Patrick: Amazing. Henry, thank you so much for your time. Henry: Patrick, thanks for having me.This site uses cookies to improve your browsing experience.

157,Alexandr Wang - A Primer on AI,Introduction," Patrick: My guest today is Alexandr Wang, the CEO and founder of Scale AI. Alexandr founded scale in 2016, having been inspired to accelerate the development of AI through his work at Cora and his studies at MIT. Specifically Alexandr realized that there was a lack of infrastructure solutions for producing high quality data, the lifeblood for AI models. Today Scale provides data solutions to leading AI teams at Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI, Flexport, the US Air Force and many others. This time last year, the business was valued at over $7 billion. Our conversation is a primer on AI. We discuss the building blocks beneath successful artificial intelligence, AI's role in both the public and private sector, and why data is the new code. We also cover the similarities and differences between AI and software from an investing perspective and what inspiration Scale takes from AWS. Please enjoy my great discussion with Alexandr Wang.",195
158,Alexandr Wang - A Primer on AI,The Role of AI in Global Conflict and Diplomacy," Patrick: So Alex, we're going to talk about every dimension I think of AI, artificial intelligence, machine learning, all the things that it's going to impact. I'd like to structure our conversation from sort of the widest angle down to the most specific, which will probably be around your specific business and product. But given what's going on in the world today, I think it's probably an appropriate place to start with the role that AI data, machine learning, et cetera, play in geopolitics and foreign policy. We're sitting here in the US and everyone's mind is on Ukraine. I think everyone understands that cyber is a sort of plane of conflict that exists, but we don't know a whole lot about to be honest, even, I don't know a whole lot about. So I'd love you to give us your overview given you've got a sort of insider view and seat and understanding of all this. What role does AI play in the global theater today in your view? Alexandr: A few assumptions to talk through, a few things to talk through that I think are really relevant here. I think one is that generally speaking, deterrence has been a incredibly positive thing for world peace and the stable world order over the course of the past 40, 50 years. I grew up in Los Alamo, New Mexico, which is the birthplace of the atomic bomb. The deterrence from the atomic bomb has been an incredible function for a stable and peaceful world order. And I think where we're at today in a broad sense is that there's an entirely new set of technologies that are either in early development, being developed right now, or have been recently been developed that are significantly shifting what conflict looks like in general. One of these is cyber security which you mentioned, which is a very challenging general attack plane because it's generally speaking, almost impossible to defend against, and the attacks are numerous in nature. There's sort of like these shots that can produce a lot of attack vectors. I think AI and machine learning is a very, very significant one. Its ability to intersect with many of these attack planes, whether that is intelligence and understanding what's happening in these various theaters, whether it's through the actual warfare component or it's through cybersecurity, a cross sectional technology across each of these different fronts.One general thing that is important to think about is that versus the prior paradigm of conflict where a lot of conflict would happen in literal physical conflict in wars in theaters, I think we're moving much more to a paradigm where hopefully 90% of conflicts are actually resolved or battled in a purely digital context long before an actual conflict arises. And so this broad shift, which is, I think is much more than just AI and machine learning, but this broad shift of sort of the physical battleground to a primarily digital battleground is probably the greatest macro shift. And then on a micro level, the ability to have great AI technology is probably one of the greatest enablers or the greatest power contributors in terms of which countries are going to able to be defend the most effectively, as well as to enable the greatest level of deterrence, the broad world order. That's the most practical view from the conflict perspective.And then I think from a geopolitical plane, I think that we're entering this period of what's called great power competition or strategic competition, where there is a small set of highly technically capable countries who are great power competitors that are strategic competitors on a number of fronts from economic competition to ideological competition, to obviously a lot of on the field competitions. And so this shift from the paradigm of the past 20 years being counter-terrorism, this shift from counter-terrorism to great power competition means that the technology itself and in particular being exceptionally good at technology is really, really critical. Artificial intelligence is just one of those technologies that happens to have compounding order of magnitude effect on any of the other technologies that we could possibly develop. And so that I think contextualizes why all this stuff matters. And I think that something that I think is incredibly important because the way that these world events happen, and I think the Russia Ukraine conflict is one great example of this is, is that they do not happen in predictable ways. There's not a predictable logical way in which events will play out over time. It is one of these great tail risks so to speak to the good and wellbeing of humanity. Patrick: If we think about the analogs between physical kinetic conflict, culminating in nuclear deterrence, it's hard to imagine something more powerful than whatever the largest strategic nuclear weapon is against the city or something. Is something similar being developed in the digital sphere. And what pops to mind is the worry that another country or another power reaches some sort of level of general artificial intelligence to use the common term first. And that thing represents the equivalent of being the first and only to have nukes. And maybe it's even harder to copy than a nuclear weapon might be. If we are shifting to digital, what do you think the arms race equivalent is towards, what is the end state that the different powers might be trying to achieve in that digital realm? Alexandr: First of all, generally speaking for artificial intelligence, it's a very multifaceted technology. It's more similar, you would say to software or the internet than it is to like any specific technology that will be built, a very particular weapon or whatnot. And so I don't quite fully agree with this analogy that an AGI is the equivalent end state to a nuclear weapon. That being said, I do think that AI and AGI, the best way to think about is it enables maybe 10X better strategic decision making and 10X better ability to actually take action against various tactics that you want to enact. Maybe the best analogy is like playing chess versus a human versus playing chess versus an incredibly talented algorithm or incredibly talented computer. The way in which it'll play out strategically dominant behavior in extended periods of conflict or extended periods of time. Patrick: How would you describe based on what you know, the current state of things amongst these great powers, what's the status of the United States, I guess is the first question. How does that relate to the status or digital capabilities of other countries, and how does public versus private sector look? Is the US private sector far better equipped than the public sector or something like this? What's the state of things? Alexandr: I'll talk about AI technology, which is the area that I understand the best. So fundamentally AI technology, modern, deep learning was initially developed primarily in the private sector through a lot of incredible research that was done at Google and DeepMind and OpenAI and Facebook and these incredible firms, as well as a lot of contemporary research done in China, the clear other major location where a lot of great artificial intelligence research has been done. And a lot of that research there's been this very fast integration of that into very particular use cases in China. Facial recognition technology, I think is one of the primary examples where this company's like SenseTime, Face++, et cetera, that are primarily contractors of the Chinese government have built world class computer vision algorithms for facial recognition for use by the Chinese government in furthering a bunch of national objectives that they have. We may have questions from humanitarian perspective, like the work being done with the Uyghurs. That all has happened in China. Then at the same time, I think this is starting to change now, but over the past, call it five years in the United States, there's been this very unclear relationship between the private sector and the public sector or the private sector and the government around the use of AI for applications like defense and intelligence.The Google cloud project Maven conflict was probably the most visible, most clear example of this. But as a general rule, I think that there's not the same level of partnership between the best and class technologists in the United States, as well as the government. That is a significant cultural problem that needs to be solved in the United States for us to really be well positioned in the future with respect to artificial intelligence. I think broadly speaking, we're in the very early days with all this technology, the speed of innovation in artificial intelligence incredibly, incredibly fast. I think what we do over the next five years or do over the next 10 years is probably 10X as important as what was done over the past five years, just given the pace and acceleration of the technology of artificial intelligence. I think the real question for policy makers in the United States, global leaders for technologists United States is what are we going to do over the next five to 10 years? And how does that compare to what other great power competitors will do over the next five to 10 years? And that I think is what will really set the stage for the next phase of this great power competition.",1874
159,Alexandr Wang - A Primer on AI,Talent as a Building Block for Scaling AI," Patrick: In the world of software you always hear about these 10X engineers and one wonders if in this realm it's even greater than that. Is the talent at the tippy top of this world going to be accessible to great powers in governments like how ... This is so important and there's this multiplier effect of like the absolute best talent. Seems like that's the thing that matters, competition for that talent, not just between great powers, but also between the top engineer, AI person at Facebook versus going to work for the NSA or something. What's been your sense of the flow of talent and the importance of talent? Do I have this roughly right that it's even more important that it might have been in software? Alexandr: There's three critical component to broad scaling of artificial intelligence. One is certainly talent, which I'll get you in a second. The second is compute and computational power, which is impossible to ignore. Especially as we think about a lot of potential disruptions to the supply chain of large data centers or large shipping manufacturing, that's a really important one for us to consider. Then the last one is data and data scale. That is obviously near and dear to my heart just running Scale, but is also something I think is also impossible to ignore. So I think those are generally speaking the three vectors that matter. I mean, there's been a bunch of research that shows that more or less power of these AI systems, both quantitatively and qualitatively scales on these three dimensions. Then if you think about talent in particular, the interesting thing is there probably is a greater scaling effect, but not because the technology itself is one that is more inclined for a brilliant mind than software per se, but actually it's probably much more a function of the power law impact of various AI systems that is actually even greater than that of software systems.I think that a lot of software systems, because they have to operate within fixed paradigms, they have more capped total impact or total utility that they can deliver. These AI systems, you think about the large language models that have been developed recently by OpenAI and Google and others. Those algorithms have an incredible ability to adapt to new domains, the cap on the level of impact or the cap on the amount of utility to be delivered is much, much higher. What that means is that the set of people who can develop these technologies, OpenAI, I don't know what the latest count is, but I think their total head count is 250 people as a corporate. That's an incredibly small number of people to generate the broad scaled impact that I think they will deliver over a multi decade time frame. So I think that's a very accurate point. This is one of the things that I think by the way, matters a lot is high skilled immigration into the United States. America's an amazing place, and I think that one of the things that is differentiated about America is a lot of people want to move to America and want to do their lives, work in America, they want to build families in America. And I think we need to do everything we can hand to enable and encourage that as much as possible. If you think about inputs or you think about the big needle movers that are actually maybe easy to change, this is one of the ones that has again, multi decade consequences. Patrick: I couldn't agree more on that point, maddening that we don't become just the perfect beacon for all the most talented people. The interesting analogy that I've heard before just to wrap our minds around the sorts of things or tasks or functions or whatever that constantly improving AI/ML models can accomplish. One model that was funny and interesting was like anything that an intern could do for you, you might be able to scale up through one of these models. It's complicated enough that a person's on it now but it's simple enough that you give it to an intern it's sort of repetitive. I always kind of like that conception. What's your way of thinking about how to communicate to your audience, other businesses using your tooling and just people general, what categories of things AI can do well, and maybe what categories of things we're excited about but might be a very long time until AI can do well. Alexandr: I think this is one of the general misconceptions about AI and machine learning, which I think causes a great deal of FUD. Which is that the intuitive belief is that the things that are easy for humans to do are going to be the things that are easy for AI and machine learning to do, which is absolutely not the case and the things that are easy for algorithms are relatively orthogonal, frankly, to things that are easy for humans to do. One simple example here is I think that it's going to be a very, very long time before we have home robots that can do things like fold your laundry and your dishes, but a much shorter time span/I think this is already today where you can have artificial intelligence systems that are world class copywriters and can write better rhetoric, better words than most people ever could. There's probably a few frameworks I would assign to this. I think in a broad general sense, one way to think about the potential impact or lower bound potential impact of artificial intelligence is kind of as you mentioned, which is the ability to scale repetitive human tasks. So take repetitive human tasks instead of going from zero to one, go from one to N human work. And I think that this is a generally amazing thing to happen because I think that humans for the most part don't enjoy repetitive tasks or generally find those relatively unpleasant and find it much more exciting to be creative and to constantly be creating.This ability to scale human tasks from one to N, is going to be this incredible, not only economic good or economic enabler for the world, but also going to be a significant enabler for humans to be more leveraged, more happy, more creative, et cetera. I think that's one way to sort of contextualize the broad impact that AI can have. And there's a bunch of other nuances, which I'm sure we'll get to. If you think about what tasks humans are good at versus what tasks algorithms are good at, generally that more or less boils down to data availability, which is that where there are large pools of digital data an algorithm can learn from, and those pools of digital data either have been collected in the past or easy to collect in the future. Those are going to be the problems which algorithms can do effectively and can learn to do effectively. And then areas where there does not exist digital data and is expensive to collect this digital data. Those are going to be the last things to be automated. So a great example is if you look at GPT 3 and these large language models, the real secret behind it is that it leverages two decades of Reddit data, which is two decades of humans using the internet and basically typing language into the internet in various forms for decades and decades and decades. And that is a pool of digital data that it used to be able to do these incredible things in writing long form text.Then if you think about this parallel that I mentioned around home robot, there's so little data about actual capture data of let's someone folding a shirt, or somebody folding a towel, or going around and doing chores, the ability to actually collect and produce that level of digital data necessary to produce algorithms that can understand that and actually perform this task is an incredibly, incredibly, incredibly hard road. This extends by the way to things that are really unintuitive. So for example, DeepMind and OpenAI very recently released algorithms some of which are very good at ... DeepMind released an algorithm that's very good at competitive programming, OpenAI released an algorithm that can prove very difficult math problems or math theorems. And these are both things which are very, very challenging for humans to do. Very, very premium skill sets as far as humans go. But there are incredible pools of visual data as well as abilities to verify or simulate the outcomes here, which allow these algorithms to reform actually incredibly, incredibly well. There's this very interesting process by which artificial intelligence will slowly automate or meaningfully change what human jobs that are primarily digital in context will look like. And then a lot of the physical work will I think be generally on touch for a very long time. Patrick: In many ways, if you're right, the whole idea of blue collar work let's call it or something like that being in jeopardy is maybe completely wrong. That the white collar work, that sort of knowledge work that's mostly digital in its form today is more susceptible. As you said, this should be a good thing, right? It should open up human leverage to higher order, more creative, more interesting tasks, non-repetitive tasks. I think that as of this morning, jobless claims are at their like all time low or since the 1960s or something. So all this great technology doesn't seem to have affected things that badly, but is that right that some of the jobs that we thought might be automated first by robots or something actually might be the last things to get automated by this model. And the more knowledge work stuff may be first? Alexandr: It's a strange thing, but I think that probably is the case. Maybe one simple model is if you spend all day in a Word Processor, all day in Excel, the actions that you take in those products are some of the most likely to be automated, frankly. And for the most part, I think a lot of that work is probably not very inspiring and so it will be this incredible enabler of leverage to think bigger about those kinds of jobs.",2059
160,Alexandr Wang - A Primer on AI,Principles for Creating and Using AI Models," Patrick: Maybe it makes sense to help people understand the process of creating one of these models in the first place. I think the discreet steps, let's say the outcome is a model that makes a useful prediction. Ultimately, this is all predictions instead of what's being generated by the models in the first place. I don't know where to start, whether it's with raw data or annotation of data, and we're starting to get into what Scale now provides for companies. But how do you think about explaining the discreet or the important stages of building one of these models in the first place? I think just understanding that architecture will let us dig into each piece a little bit more. Alexandr: Again, everything starts with the data. I often will analogize the data for these algorithms as the ingredients that you would make a dish with, or the ingredients that you would make something that you'd eat with. Is incredibly, incredibly important. We often say this thing, which is data is the new code. If you compare traditional software versus AI software, in traditional software, the lifeblood is really the code. That's the thing that informs the system what to do. In artificial intelligence and machine learning, the lifeblood is really the data. That is certainly like one major change. That's really important. The life cycle for most of these algorithms is a few fold. So first is this process of collecting large amounts of data. By collecting it could be data that is already sitting there. There's a lot of software processes that already collect a bunch of data. There's a lot of cameras in the world that already collect a bunch of data, but you need to get the raw data in the first place. Then it goes through this process of annotation, which is the conversion of this large pools of unstructured data to structured data that algorithms can actually learn from. This could be for example, in imagery or video from a self-driving car marking where the cars and pedestrians and signs and road markings, and bicyclists and whatnot are so that an algorithm can actually learn from those things. It could be for example, in large snippets of text, actually summarizing that text so that now we can understand and learn what it means to actually summarize text. So whatever that translation is from unstructured data to a structured format that these algorithms can learn from, then it goes through a training process.So these algorithms basically look through these rims and rims of data, learn patterns and slowly train themselves so to speak, to be able to do whatever task is necessary on top of the data. And then you launch one of these algorithms in production and you run them on real world data, and they're constantly producing as you mentioned these predictions. The very important piece is, this is not a sort of like one way process this is actually a loop. If you look at almost every algorithm that has launched out their own production, it is not a sort of you build the algorithm and then you're done because these algorithms are generally very brittle and unless you're constantly updating them and maintaining them, they will eventually do things that you don't want them to do, or they'll eventually perform poorly. There's this critical process by which you are constantly then replenishing them. You're constantly going and recollecting new data, annotating it, training the algorithm, launching that new algorithm onto production and you constantly undergo this process to create very high quality algorithms. Patrick: I want to make sure that this interesting point you made about data being the new code really hits home for people, and maybe even put that in a business context. So if the IP or the moat of a software company is this code base that takes a very long time to develop, has all sorts of dimensions to it. Maybe it's microservices, maybe it's some code monolith, it's questionably like an incredibly valuable asset. It's digital, but it's an incredibly valuable asset to the company. And you're talking about, I think, a transition where it's something different where maybe, I don't know, maybe Google's data repository or something, is this unbelievable advantage that they have because no one else has access to all of their data. Is that kind of what you mean? That ultimately maybe something like Google, their data is worth a lot more than their code base. And that that would become a trend that we see sort of across industries? Alexandr: If you look at the highest performing algorithms across a variety of different domains, image recognition and speech recognition and summarizing texts and answering questions of texts. So these very different cognitive tasks, look under the hood, they actually all use the exact same code base. That's been this very meaningful shift that's happened over the past few years in artificial intelligence. We're at this point where the code has become effectively the same and more or less a commodity so to speak when it comes to artificial intelligence and machine learning. The thing that enables the differentiation is really the data and the data sets that are used to power these algorithms. To your point, if you think about ... One of the ways that we talk about this in a business context is if you think about what is your strategic asset? In general in business, your strategic assets are the things that allow you to differentiate yourself against your competition. In a world where 99.99% of the software in the world is sort of traditional software, and then only 0.01% is AI software, then you care the most about your code. Your code is what will differentiate your product versus your competitor's product or your processes versus your competitors' processes, et cetera. But then as more and more of the software in the world's written, infused with AI, using AI or over time the interfaces shift to AI. Interfaces and Alexa like interface for example, as that shift happens, as you go from 99.99 to 90:10 or 80:20, or even 50:50 over time, the vector of differentiation totally shifts to data and the data sets that you have access to. And so that means is that your strategic differentiator to your point as a firm is going to be primarily based off of what are my existing data assets.And then what is the engine by which I'm constantly producing new insightful differential data to power these core algorithms that are actually powering my business. And these algorithms at the core that will power the future of business, I think are relatively core. I think there's definitely algorithms around automating business processes that are going to result in significantly more profitable firms over time. There's going to be algorithms that are based around customer recommendations and customer life cycle, which is a lot of the algorithms that we've seen date. Imagine TikTok recommendation algorithm, but for like every economic interaction or every economic transaction in your life that is constantly identifying the perfect next thing that you may want to transact with. And that is going to exist across every firm or every industry is basically going have to build their version of that. And that's going to result in significantly more efficient trade. The long-term impacts of that you could think of as like a general reduction in marketing expenses or sales and marketing expenses because the algorithm just does a better job at knowing what the user wants to do next and having to do all this marketing and all this very active sales. There's a lot of very real changes to I think the physics of what the best businesses will look like in, let's say a decade or two decades or three decades that come from artificial intelligence. If you think about what will allow me to do these things better than someone else, it's the quality, efficacy and volume of the data that is used to power these algorithms. Patrick: If getting to that state of some sort of differentiated data advantage is the goal, then that engine that you referenced becomes critical idea for any company, a piece of infrastructure. What principles are there about building a good engine for data gathering, that maybe cut across different types that you've observed. What's behind the great engines that you've seen for gathering data? Alexandr: There's a few tenants. I think first quantity is a quality of its own. You want to just have lots and lot to data coming in. That will be a differentiator, no matter what, not all data is created equal. And so you want in general, the way these algorithms work is it's sort of like needles in the haystack, almost in most of your data that end up being differential valuable. You'll want to develop a process by which you can actually what's called curate, but identify and understand what are the really valuable pieces of data in general data inflow that we're getting. You'll want strategy for data diversity, or you'll want a strategy by which you're not just going to keep collecting the same old data by which you're going to constantly be expanding the domains or the kinds of data or the diversity of data that you're going to be collecting over time. That's a really interesting one. I think that one of the more intuitive examples that I think people understand the best is that Tesla's autonomous vehicle strategy. One core part of their strategies that they have all of the Teslas in the world are in some sense collection vehicles, they're all encountering very rare situations that then improve and help the machine learning algorithm. There is a truth to that idea, which is that because not only have a greater volume, but they also have great systems who identify these needles in haystack. That's a strategy by obtaining an incredibly diverse data set over time, that's very beneficial to the long term differentiation of their machine learning stack. By the way, Tesla has other challenges as well. So this is on a clearly dominant strategy, but there is truth to some of these ideas. Patrick: What should we know about the state of technology around annotating data that I know obviously Scale is deeply involved with the example in Ukraine around like satellite imagery. There's this interesting jump from like raw data or raw input into some sort of refined signal or piece of information or whatever. I don't know what the right terminology is. What is the state of that in the world today? Has that changed a lot? Has that been pretty constant over the last few years? Where's it going? Alexandr: I think it's meaningfully changed. It's one of these very interesting problem domains and one that we find incredibly exciting because it's undeniably a ""dirty problem,"" or it's undeniably a very complex multifaceted, operational and challenging problem. Historically speaking, this has been done in an incredibly low tech way and an incredibly very manually intensive way for the AI industry to date. And a lot of that has been because it hasn't been a problem that technologists have wanted to dedicate themselves to. For the most part, most people who go into computer science or most people who go into artificial intelligence by definition, they go into computer science because it's a significantly more constrained problem that doesn't involve these complexities around human operations. But I'm proud of the Scale team for having really done a lot of this work that I think will be seminal is starting with a very manually intensive or manually challenging process that is operationally very intensive and then adding meaningful amounts of automation, whether that's algorithms that will do a lot of the work before it gets to people, or algorithms are able to identify most of the errors that people might make, or in general, injecting a lot of operational efficiency processing into this process to enable significantly better outcomes and either more efficient processes or more higher quality data.That is really the core engine behind what we've built at Scale that has enabled some of the biggest platforms in the world, such as Meta or Microsoft, or many of these other large tech firms to significantly scale out of their machine learning efforts. One of the companies that we really look to for inspiration and we've been deeply inspired by is what Amazon has done in two different spots in their business. They've done it not only with logistics for eCommerce, but they've also done it with AWS. They've taken both of these very large complex half operational half technological problems, and they've added significant amounts of technology and automation and operational efficacy to result in orders of magnitude better performance than you could have accomplished in the past without sort of this embrace of the messiness of the problem.",2604
161,Alexandr Wang - A Primer on AI,Building the AWS of the Future," Patrick: A good excuse to talk about literally what Scale does more than an hour in. And it got into the business itself, a whole bunch of amazing context and lessons so far. What are the building blocks? I'm struck that if you go to the little products tab on Scale's website, it looks not dissimilar from the AWS tabs of old where there's lots of individual functions that are part of this value chain if you will, of building one of these things that you can ""hire"" Scale to do. Just talk us through the business itself, what it does for customers and how that product lineup fits together. If you are the retail operation infrastructure equivalent or the AWS equivalent for the AI future, what does that look like today? Alexandr: Where we started was really this problem around data annotation, because what we noticed is that it was this massive bottleneck for the overall progress of machine learning is that most firms could simply not get high enough quality data sets for them to actually build great algorithms. Those very much the initial problem that we set out to solve, which is how do we enable companies to get better data to fuel better AI at its core. And we started by doing that with some of the most technologically sophisticated firms in the world. We work with, as I mentioned Meta, Microsoft, we work with large automakers and building autonomous vehicles like Toyota and General Motors. We work with OpenAI on a lot of their cutting edge research, work with large internet companies like Instacart or Etsy or Flexport on a large scale machine learning problems. And then through doing that, we've built what we really believe to be the best engine in the business or the best engine in the industry around producing these very high quality data sets.And a lot of our view in expanding beyond that has been that primitive is incredibly powerful and then integrating that primitive with other components of broader machine learning life cycle that was referencing before enables us to produce really powerful products, just like how for AWS, they started with the primitives of storage and compute, and then they sort of combined those primitives in many interesting ways to produce these incredibly powerful products like RDS or their DNS products or the list kind of goes on and on, to solve customer business problems. Really look at the same way. We have built this core primitive around data annotation and the production of high quality artificial intelligence data sets. We can combine that with other primitives that we've built such as data management products, or model monitoring products or algorithmic development products. And we combine all these primitives in producing these products that solve really core customer problems, whether that's in the government space, working with defense and intelligence agencies and building really high quality artificial intelligence algorithms to solve core national security problems, or that's in solving, working with large complex fortune 500s who have incredible amounts of unstructured data, such as documents flowing into their business.And we build automation to support a lot of that document processing, or we work with large math builders and we use artificial intelligence and human processing to enable this map creation. One of the great lessons from Amazon as a business is that parallel execution is incredibly powerful. The traditional business logic or the traditional business truism is around, ""Hey, you should really just focus on a few things and do those things really, really well. And that's your sort of like strategic edge."" Amazon really threw that out and became very focused on parallel execution while focusing on what are the primitives that are going to enable them to build a lot of products very successfully. And we take more of that approach, which is we've built incredible primitives. We're going to make those primitives better and better and better. And then we're combining these primitives into building best in class products for our customers. Patrick: One of the things you'll hear about Amazon Web Services specifically is that at the end of the day, what they're really trying to drive people towards is more S3 and EC2 storage and compute spend. Those are like the most basic building blocks and a lot of the other services that AWS provides effectively maps back on to increasing the volume of storage and compute as a business model. Do you think that that's true for you all too? And if so, what are the S3 and EC2 equivalents for Scale? Alexandr: We think that's true to an extent in that, again, we're almost religious in this belief that better data results in better AI and the data is a new code. And so we really think about as like, how does Scale become the long term infrastructure provider to powering more or less the global expansion data to meet the needs of AI globally? That I think is certainly one very large driving factor and a lot of our goal is to build the most data centric, AI infrastructure platform out there. But at the same time, I think that maybe one of the things that we really index on as a company, and I think that some Silicon Valley companies do this some don't, but we would certainly take this approach is to really index on the customer value creation, which I think is really important in the space of artificial intelligence and machine learning because frankly speaking, this has been a technology that people have been talking about for a very long time.And then the actual value creating use cases are few and far between. There's a lot of distrust of AI systems. There's a lot of belief AI isn't good or AI is so bad or AI is just this snake oil technology. That is absolutely not true. Artificial intelligence is incredibly power technology, but there's been an incredible dearth of firms that are focused on how do you index against the actual customer value and the customer outcomes they're able to generate using technologies. On the one hand, we probably do believe this large scale growth of the primitive belief around large scale growth of powering these data sets for machine learning. We also believe on the other end of working very hard to power as big or as meaningful customer outcomes as possible. And that being a primary metric fund which we value ourselves. Patrick: If we zoom in on the original use case helpful annotation of data, what does that mean in the literal sense? If the outcome is well labeled, clean, large data set, and the input is whatever, what is the gap that Scale was filling? What is the function that it was actually doing to help the company produce more cleaner, better data? Alexandr: This is sort of the state of the market that we saw when we entered it. Even when we had started, there were large number of very talented machine learning teams that were solving varied problems from autonomous vehicles to building AI for eCommerce to building sort of voices and systems. There were a lot of interesting use cases in the technology. Each time we'd go to one of these firms, we would ask them, what are your biggest problems, always in the top three data quality and data volumes, one of them, and you'd dig into it. And it's because they have this incredible challenge of motivating their incredibly brilliant smart ML engineers and ML scientists, and working on journey problems around data and data quality. So these gaps are technological. Sometimes these gaps are cultural. I think for us, we really view as some mix of both. But what we did is we went into all these firms. We took incredible religion and care to build great technology to solve data quality, data volume, bottleneck. Those really limiting the efficacy and power of their machine learning models at the end of the day, and sort of rebuilt. We took, I don't know, maybe to stripe the playbook is what you would say it was with the AWS playbook before them. We built great developer APIs and a great developer platform that enabled the machine learning engineers and machine learning scientists to basically hid an API, get as much high quality data as they needed, or they wanted. And behind the scenes, we would do an incredible amount of dirty work to make this possible and actually enable them to build these great algorithms. Patrick: Maybe just to nail the point home, like a couple examples of these dirty jobs might be the categorization of images or sub components of an image or something like that. Would that be like a good example? Alexandr: Yeah. Great examples are like given a huge amount of imagery or a huge amount of data off of a robot, whether that's a software in car or some other robot marking and all that imagery, what are the things that are important for that robot to see? So enabling the robots to see in the first place, other similar ""dirty jobs"" are for financial services firms. They have incredible amounts of transaction data. All this transaction is fundamentally unstructured. So understanding who are the vendors in these transactions, what are the locations? What are the other pieces of insight that you can pull out of these transactions, and other ones around other forms of audio data. For example, and pulling out the relevant intent and understanding from audio data. So all these dirty jobs, they fundamentally start with some data format that machines can't read today and making them effectively legible for these machine systems. Patrick: If I fast forward and think about Scale's future 5, 10 years down line, how would you describe the absolute best case of success? So if the mission is accelerate the development of AI, make it easy for companies to build more AI models effectively, which I think is kind of the core mission of the firm. What is the best version of that look like do you think 5 or 10 years from now? Alexandr: I mean, I think we really take the view that it just comes down to the customer outcomes that we're enabling. So rather than thinking about what Scale exactly looks like in 10 years, I think the right thing to look at is in 10 years are the majority of companies in the world able to effectively use artificial intelligence in some very high impact application to solve a business need. Is that application in some way or another powered through Scale products? And we take a very open minded view is we're going to build lots of products over time that can power these products in different ways. The delivery mechanism of the algorithm, we may not build the exact product that a fortune 500 uses. We may be powering some SaaS company that is integrating AI into their product that the fortune 500 uses. We basically want to take this very long term platform view that as long as we are there powering decade long massive expansion of AI and machine learning, we're going to be really pleased and happy. Patrick: If we zoom out and go to the more market side of things and put my investor hat on and think about what drives enterprise value, value creation, the things that investors ultimately care about when they're putting money into a business, they want to get a lot more money out. The world of software has obviously been a center stage for seven, 10 years now because they've tended to be very scalable, fairly high margin, incredibly fast growing businesses. And the word that you never want to hear as an investor is deceleration, in the growth world where maybe they're reaching saturation points and software is no longer a new thing. It's a fairly mature thing. How do you think about, you mentioned this concept of thinking about like an S curve and maybe we're for software approaching the diminishing part of that S curve. Where is AI in that same thing and how might these two things intersect to form lots of new enterprise value in the future if software becomes overly saturated? Alexandr: One thing to think about software for a moment, the sort of alchemy or the magic of software is that A, you're able to collect very large scale data sets in a very coordinated way, B that you're able to build simple workflow tooling on top of these data sets, think about your traditional CRM or frankly the majority of SaaS tooling is workflows on top of these data sets that enable business value. Then three is basically infinite scalability of a lot of these systems. These are some of the like technological primitives that have enabled SaaS broadly speaking, or software in general to produce a lot of value for most enterprises, but these primitives or these forms of alchemy have some cap, that's for the saturation of software that you're mentioning. Well, then if you think about AI technology and you use this mental model that I mentioned before, which is the fundamental promise of AI technology is you can take repetitive task that people are doing, you go from one to N with those repetitive tasks so you can automate the Nth repetitive tasks rather than relying on humans for that. Well, if you look at the majority of fortune 500 businesses or the majority largest enterprise in the world, there are an incredible number of parts of their business, where they spend enormous amounts of money on large teams of people to do repetitive tasks.The alchemy that is possible there is not only the automation of meaningful parts of that work, but also the ability to even go further than even the best trained humans could do in many of those tasks. There's some value that potential economic value or the TAM so to speak of AI machine learning is just absolutely astronomical. I think that is at minimum 10X, probably 100X the total business value that has been generated by SaaS systems or software historically, I think if you think about it, you have this one S curve of the saturation of software. And then there's this very, very early S curve that is being developing right now around the productization and productionization of large scale AI systems, let's say in the enterprise, or let's say across businesses. And the real question is, okay, what's the pacing of that S-curve versus the pacing of the saturation and deceleration of the current software S-curve? And I'm an optimist in not too long, we're going to have a massive proliferation of AI use cases within the enterprise that are going to be way more impactful than the use cases of software in the past. And the way you'll see that the business ROIs generated from high quality AI systems are going to be 10X more than the business value generated by let's say, deploying a CRM or deploying an ERP system. Patrick: How would you advise those listening who maybe run businesses and are nodding their heads and think this all makes sense. This is a new competitive plane or competitive frontier. And I want to make sure I'm not left behind, but I'm not a data scientist. I don't have this in my background strategically or tactically. What would be the questions that you would have them ask themselves to start incorporating this thinking into their business? Alexandr: I think the big questions are really around understanding the data that powers your business, and understanding at a meaningful level what are these potential data sets within your business that can fuel a lot of this future way of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Then I think it's really thinking about, and I think this is probably in partnership with partner or in partnership with advisors, is thinking through what are the highest value business problems that artificial intelligence could solve that would meaningfully move physics of my business. I kind of mentioned a few of them, but one that I think applies to nearly every business is problem around customer recommendations or basically building better recommendations to empower customer life cycles. Another one that I think empowers almost every business is taking some of the most expensive, repetitive process internally and figuring out ways to automate or make those more efficient.And I think it's thinking through what are these core business use cases. One very tactical piece of advice that I'd give is one of the challenges of AI is we're going to have this huge shortage of human capital that is trained in AI and machine learning and deep learning for a very long time. I think that's going to be big bottleneck for many decades, frankly. I think for most business owners, you identify partners who have some of that human capital and have a lot of expertise and experience to help guide you through that process. Whether that's Scale or whether that's another company, it is important to identify these business partners who can help accelerate journeys here.",3444
162,Alexandr Wang - A Primer on AI,Potential Risks and Implications of AI," Patrick: I love the human capital angle. I mean, we're still short traditional software developers and engineers, and we're into that cycle a long way. So can imagine this is that on steroids. What, if anything worries you about the proliferation of all of this technology, maybe even the technology that you yourselves are developing that allows faster development of AI models? I'm of the view always that technology is sort of like a morally neutral, it can be used for good or bad. I like to think that it's mostly used for good it seems that way, based on outcomes over time, but what is concerning to you about the potential or the leverage that this might give people that shouldn't have it? Alexandr: One major one that actually keeps me up at night is this thing that we talked about at the very beginning, which is AI in the context of geopolitics and great power competition. I think that there is an incredible potential for AI to either rapidly accelerate or result in bad outcomes for some of the conflicts for the next call it 50 years. And so I think that is one very pointed, specific use case as the terminology that does keep me up at night. In addition to that, I think there's these two competing curves in AI. It's interesting to see how they'll play out, but one of the things that I think generally technology, concern about any sort of technology accelerating is inequality in the world. I think that it's not totally clear with AI, what the exact effect is, intrinsically the technology benefits from scale, the bigger and bigger models are, the better and better it is that results in new building better AI systems. Generally technologies that favor scale do result in greater levels of inequality. I think that's something that we really need to watch out for. At the same time that's why the democratization of the technology matters a lot. And that's also why the building it into use cases that affect a lot of people and enable a lot of people to who live better lives is also really critical. Again, there's sort of these two competing curves in the technology. One is the benefits to scale and the other is lowering of fixed costs and the democratization of the technology. And I think we would need to be very mindful about how these curves intersect over time or what the directions look like and the relative speeds. Patrick: What is the most interesting AI model you've ever seen? Alexandr: I'll nerd out a little bit here. I'm preposition to like these scientific applications, but both alpha code and alpha fold are deeply interesting machine learning algorithms. I think that alpha code is almost like brain break in terms of thinking that you have these machine learning systems, they can solve these competitive programming problems better than the median competitor, and the competitors who compete in these things are already incredibly high up on the distribution of humans who can do some of this work. Beating the competitors is probably beating 99.9% of humans at these programming tasks. And that's just insane. If you had asked me even five years ago, if I thought that was going to be possible, I would've said no. I don't think that AI systems are going to be able to reason and think through these complex creative problems well enough, but here we are, again, the availability of the digital data. We have systems that can perform that well. Patrick: What's an example of that? What would be something that alpha code is producing that a very talented human competitor is also producing so we can compare them. Alexandr: There's these classic programming questions, almost like the interview questions that a software engineer would be asked in an interview process. So classic brain teasery algorithm questions that for decades we have used in Silicon Valley to test incoming engineers for their talent. That's something that the machine learning system alpha code can perform just as well as some of the best engineers out there. So another way to look at this, if your touring test is a set of programming interviews to get a job at Google, you probably have a machine learning system now that can pass that touring test. It's a pretty shocking thing and I think that this is more philosophical, but I think that myself as a programmer, I think a lot of programmers take pride in their role as sort of the master of the machine, so to speak, or the person who tells the machine what to do and programs the machine, it's this funny role reversal that the machines are now better at a lot of that work than humans. Patrick: What are the implications of that? As you said, it's kind of hard to wrap your mind around. Does that start to mean that we just continue to collapse the frictions between I'll call it like human intent and programmable outcomes? It's almost like our imaginations become the limit rather than the elegant work. Alexandr: Yeah, that's exactly right. This is like a broad trend within software, but I think to your point, the beautiful end state is that we as people we're just going to be able to dictate into a machine learning system, what kind of software we want it to build, and it'll build something that basically accomplishes that exactly. So we can all be product managers effectively in our own mini systems. That future state, I think is like reasonably far away, maybe not infinitely far away but reasonably far away, but we're already seeing this where take these GitHub co-pilot systems. They meaningfully accelerate the programming task. There's this thing that's going to happen, where programming and product management, in some sense, we're going to keep converging where differential tasks or the differential skill is in understanding what to build rather than actually being able to build it in the first place. Patrick: It's sort of like the classic idea in machine learning that it's the label, it's the outcome that you're targeting that requires all the imagination and creativity, not the features that you're using to predict that outcome. Questions become more valuable than answers, I guess, is the other way of saying what you said, which is just, is very cool. It unlocks the core of, I guess, what makes us human, which is pretty exciting to imagine. I hope I get to live to see a lot of that happen. Alex this has been so much fun. I love this topic. I am so interested in these technologies. I think I asked the same traditional closing question of everybody. What is the kindest thing that anyone's ever done for you? Alexandr: It's not one specific action, but I think that my first violin teacher, her name is Cayenne Unum, I don't know if she'll ever listen to this, but maybe she will. Over the course of many years of working with her. I think she really instilled a few things in me. I think first, she really created a love and joy from art and creative activity and she herself, which is so incredibly joyous and very inspired and clearly loved very deeply the art and process of the creation of great music and great performance, which was just incredibly infectious. I think one learning is just that passion is incredibly infectious thing. There's a very specific moment that I remember really quite vividly, which is there's this period where I wasn't practicing very much.And I thought I could sort like skip by or she wouldn't notice. And obviously plainly obvious to her. At one point she just ended the lesson I remember two minutes in and she said, ""If you're not practicing at all, we should stop wasting your parents' money and just stop on lessons."" It was like this shocking thing. I think I was in sixth or seventh grade at the time. And so I was shocked to have something so direct, be confirmed with something so direct, but I think what it really showed me, if you're going to do something, you have to do it with full passion and full force. If you're not going to do something with full passion and full force, then it probably just isn't worth doing in the first place. This has been really a driving belief behind a lot of my life. I wrote this blog post a while ago called Hire People who Give a Shit. Patrick: I remember reading it. Alexandr: Yeah. It just becomes so core to I think it's how we even hire at Scale or a lot of what we do at Scale is don't half ask. You got to do things with full force and full passion. Patrick: Absolutely love this story. One follow up question. I remember the post well and it was excellent. How do you do that? What is the most effective way to understand, not having yet worked with somebody if there's someone that gives a shit. Alexandr: One of the funny things about giving a shit, you notice it along the edges, so to speak. You notice it in maybe the depth of thought, the depth of obsession, the attention to detail, along the edges of something they really care about. I think one great example. Let's take music for example. When you're preparing a great performance, you will start noticing just the smallest fricking things and you'll just stop yourself and keep practicing until you're impeccable. All the mini flourishes and all the mini components and the way that you notice great performance is not do they get the notes right. But it's like how packable and how clearly perfect is each little detail. That's one general thing is like, I think you notice it along the edges more so than just looking full frontal at the thing itself. You can notice it by talking to people about what were the little details that you really paid attention to? Or what were the things that really bothered you about how something was being done or what were the things that took 80% of the time that other people wouldn't know notice?That's one big thing. You'll notice it just from like the passion in people's voice and how they care. Some people express that more outwardly, some people are maybe more reserved, but you'll notice in just the care and sort of the attention by which they express those things. And then the other thing I think is from my time meeting lots of people and talking to lots of people and learning about humans in general. There are people who are generally very inspired and there are people who are generally less inspired, and the people who are more inspired you'll notice this like theme in their life. They find things that inspire them and they find the next thing that inspires and they find the next thing that inspires them, and inspires a full force and will. I think you can notice that pattern a lot when people just talk through their lives and what they've done in the past. Sometimes it's a very wide set of things. People can be inspired by punk music when they're a kid, and then they become inspired by DCFs and investing when they're an adult. But I think that just noticing that strength of will in these instances is really critical. Patrick: I think it's such a wonderful, interesting place to close that giving a shit manifests in the details and at the edges. I love that concept. I think it's so true if you ask yourself the things you're proud of producing, it's very easy to answer that question. What were the details that took all the time, and when you can't answer that question, it's probably indicative that you did a just okay job at it or didn't care that much. I just love it as a closing thought. Alex, this has been a total blast. I've learned a ton. Thank you so much for your time. Alexandr: Yeah. Thank you so much. As I mentioned, when I first chatted, I'm such a fan of the podcast, so I'm excited to be on here. Patrick: Pleasure's all mine.This site uses cookies to improve your browsing experience.

165,Antonio Gracias - Pro-Entropic Investing,Valor’s History & Operating Expertise," Patrick: The path dependency there, the lessons learned from watching an actual path versus a point estimate, meeting someone for the first time, I just think is a really good insight. I want to return to it. But it makes me realize that I think it's important to tell the Valor story too, because you've had a unique path into this style of investing. And I think coming from a more traditional private equity background, in terms of style of investing, towards a more technology-centric pro-entropic type of company, very power law driven outcome stuff. So maybe just tell us the story of Valor itself, the earliest origin days, what you were doing, and how and why it evolved the way that it did. Antonio: Sure. So I worked at Goldman Sachs and left there in the mid-'90s. Really, I did two things. One is I went to law school, but I didn't want to waste my time completely, so I wanted to buy a company. I had a little company when I was in college, and my mom had a store growing up, and I liked business, and I come from a family of doctors and dentists and stuff, so I wanted to be in business. This is the mid-'90s, so I think maybe today I'd probably go into Silicon Valley, but back then it was more trying to buy a company. I bought a little plating company in Gardena, California in 1995 while I was going to law school in Chicago, and it plated connectors. I was the naive guy who bought a plating company with environmental liabilities in California, in the mid-'90s, in the middle of all the super fun problems.That was something you would never do if you knew what you were doing. Only someone who's 24, 25-years-old, super naive, could ever do something quite so dumb. Then at the same time, I was a little bit smart in the sense that we made connectors. So what they plated was connectors and obviously the internet was taking off and it was a way to, I'd say, be invested in the internet and work on the internet. Then what happened was, over time, we integrated the supply chain, so we're doing plating. And in that first company, I really learned operations. I ended up running it myself, flying back and forth from Chicago to LA to run it, became the CEO of the company, and learned plant operations from the guys on the floor. I'm still grateful to each of them. They taught me about the theory of constraints. They taught me about how to improve throughput in a facility like this.I speak Spanish, a lot of them spoke Spanish, and so it was a fun relationship for me to learn from them and ask a lot of questions. And so then I decided to integrate the supply chain for connectors. We bought stamping, molding, and assembly. A couple of my partners I have here today, Tim Watkins and Jon Shulkin, joined me back then to build that company, the connector company. We ended up taking it from about 10 million revenue to 125 million revenue in about six, seven years and sold it, just as the internet bubble was peaking. Bought an auto parts company that had factories in the US and Mexico that was doing coatings as well in the late '90s, just as I was finishing law school actually, and then fixed that, it was a bit of a turnaround, and sold it. Then invested also in PayPal and Answerthink, and a few other technology companies, because I knew the people in these areas and I was interested in it.Part of the law school story, what's fun is I ended up investing in PayPal, which is how I met Elon and some of those folks, was because David Sacks, who was the Chief Product Officer at PayPal, was my law school classmate. And that’s actually how this whole thing started. This is quite funny, the first day of new student orientation, there was an actual face book. This is before Facebook. So there was actually a book and David saw that I worked at Goldman Sachs and he didn't want to be a lawyer. He'd gone to Stanford and he and Peter, two old friends at Stanford. He had started PayPal - he came and found me. So we started talking, we actually missed the booze cruise and went to Lincoln Park, went to a bar, hung out, and became good friends. And he and another classmate named Scott Stein, they became roommates. And those two guys carried me through law school. So I stopped going to class completely, just showing up for exams. They gave me their notes and helped me learn the stuff and I read the books. And we became really good friends. We're still friends to this day. But that's actually how I got through law school and was able to do this other stuff as well. Patrick: I want to come back to the transition into early Valor, but you mentioned the theory of constraints. And I want to talk about operations and the operations work that Valor does, I think completely uniquely, relative to peers, discuss that concept. what is the theory of constraints? Why is it so powerful? Do you think it's universally applicable in business, or is it more applicable to certain kinds of businesses? Antonio: I think it's universally applicable. I recommend to anyone listening to this podcast, ""The Goal"". When I was trying to figure out how to run this factory, and I didn't know what to do, I went to a friend of mine who was at business school and said, ""What should I read?"" And he told me to read this book called ""The Goal"", which was great. And it really comes down to physics. So the laws we're talking about, the second law of thermodynamics, the theory of constraints, these all are concepts that exist inside of physics. And it's simply that a system operates at its slowest limiter. In the plating context, an example, we had big, long lines, hundred-foot long lines that had plating of nickel, gold, et cetera, going onto beryllium-copper substrates. And the slowest thing in that line to plate was nickel. And I asked the question one day of one of our platers, ""Is there a way to make this thing go faster, please?""He was a second shift guy. And he said, ""Oh yeah, there's a way to do it. The guy that ran the company before you, he had three nickel baths, and now we have one, and we go one third as fast."" So I went to go talk to the chemist and I asked him the question, ""What's going on?"" And he's describing Faraday's law. If you have an aqueous solution and you put a current through it, basically the current dissipates in the center. So if you make the bath longer, you've got to slow the whole thing down to get the right amount of plating on the part. And we went, let's take over three nickel baths. Well, it takes one extra chemist, it's going to cost pretty much nothing. Okay, let's do that. That's an example. It's a closed system and, in a closed system like this, the thing that limits its speed is the slowest element.That was really how I started thinking about closed versus open systems theory. And first I started thinking about entropy, which is when you're thinking about entropy, it's actually an open system. If the world tends towards more entropy, it's because the system is open. When you have these very closed systems, like in a manufacturing facility, you don't have as much entropy inside, what you have is this idea of constraint-based thinking. In this case, it was driven by Faraday's law, but it happens in pretty much any business I've seen.At our business here, we’re in the asset management investment business, we think about it this way. We know that our constraints should always be in our operations teams. We're continuing to hire operations people. We could invest more capital, there's more good opportunities, than we have operations people to help them. And so we think about this as our portfolio size, the amount of capital we're managing, is driven by our ability to serve our companies. In our business here, we define our customer as the company we're investing in. Our operations work, the lean stuff we do for them, is the valuable service we provide them. And so we know that that's our primary constraint and everything else revolves around actually being able to make investments that are really, really good. But the thing that limits how many investments we’re making here, is can we serve them?I have yet to run into a good business where, if we really thought through it with the executives, they weren't constraint-based thinking. And it's one of the things, by the way, I really enjoyed about working with Elon over the years, because he has a physics background, he 100% thinks this way. And most of the executives I've met, whether they know they're doing it or not, actually think this way. What part of my business should I work on today to make the whole system go faster? And if things are high quality and high speed, typically the product is good. The customer's happy. The velocity's going up, and if you're improving velocity quality, your business is getting better. Patrick: If I was a founder and I was considering taking money from Valor versus some other great investor, and I was really honed in on this operation support that Valor uniquely provides, is the right way for me to think about that, that effectively someone that's an expert at this idea of the theory of constraints is coming into my business and applying that thinking or teaching us that thinking? And what else is in that package, if I'm thinking about that thing as a product, is that the primary feature? And what are the other features? Antonio: We do it a couple layers down from that. So we would ask you the question of, ""Hey, what are the top three problems you have in your business?"" And you might say to us, ""Hey, I better grow my sales team faster."" And we would say, ""Okay, we know how to do that."" And we have people that are really good at sales operations, and what they will do is come in and current-state map your sales functionas an example, and sit down with you and your team, and decide what the future state would look like. And then help build those processes and help you hire the people to put in place to make that happen. Typically over three to six months, and our teams are doing that thing.So it's interesting because we don't use the same language now, we use the language with lean, because along the way from the mid-'90s to today, lean rubric entered the American lexicon from Japan. And lean is the theory of constraints, plus quality improvement with this system, this high intensity system they use, which we do as our current-state, future-state mapping exercises. So we'd probably use more lean language today. You'd tell us your problems, and usually what happens is one of those problems we know how to solve. And our product set is built around that. We can do sales growth optimization, we can do business process improvement. We can do quality improvement. Usually someone has a problem that lays inside of one of these areas. Patrick: You've got the hands-on operating experience yourself, applying some of these lessons to improve the business by 10 X or more. And then you transition into this more, a traditional I'll call it, private equity structure where the product is that you're deploying capital. It comes with this operational support. What are the next couple of chapter headings that you think are interesting in Valor’s own story? Maybe leading up to that first investment in SpaceX in 2005. That '01 to '05 era is really interesting to me. Antonio: We'd sold our first companies in the early 2000s, and decided to go into the fund business because, you called them fundless deal sponsors, but we were young guys trying to buy companies back then, there was no word for it. We had a group, a team of people together, that I had really grown to care for, and it felt like a fellowship to us. The most enjoyable times in my career are when you're working on something you really care about, that you think matters to the world, with people you respect. It's the best. It's awesome. And we had that. We have that now, we had it then. So we wanted to keep the band together, so to speak. And it seemed like the best way to do that was with the fund, because we had people who joined different times, various degrees of capital acquired, et cetera. So it was just to create a future for the team. And it's always been for us 50/50, whether we go be entrepreneurs or continue in the fund business, and now we're scaled in the fund business so it makes sense to keep doing that. But when we first started, it was really like, ""Should I go buy a company and build another company, or start a company, or should I go into the fund business?"" We went into the fund business, and kept our operations capacity that we had from the early days with us. And then started deploying that into companies we were working with in the fund business.In our early days in the fund business, in the same fund we had this balance sheet vehicle running called Valor R&D that was doing venture. SpaceX and that back in the early 2000s. We wanted to put Tesla in that side vehicle that had partners capital. And we went to our advisory board for fund one and said, ""We want to make this investment. We need you to approve it."" And they were like, ""No, no, put in the fund."" So it actually ended up in fund one and we joined the board a few years later. That's how it all started. But we also did buyouts, traditional buyouts of value-based companies in the same fund. So we have these two things going on at the same time, this technology investment strategy that's what we really like, and the buyout turnaround strategy, which we're used to doing from the old days. And the next chapter would be going into the fund business and having both of these at the same time. My partners, Tim Watkins who's an engineering genius guru, who did a lot of work at Tesla, SpaceX and other places, Jon Shulkin who's co-president at the firm now, he's been with us for 20 plus years. These guys are both great at operations and investments. And then we had another partner join who is co-president, Juan Sabater in fund two, who is awesome. He's a former Goldman Sachs guy and looked at our whole portfolio and said, ""Hey guys, I just got to point out to you that this technology stuff where you're doing non-control investing and you're helping companies scale, looks like a lot of fun, generates a lot of return and it's good for the world. And this other stuff over here is not very fun, generates a bunch of losses, and not so sure we're making a difference."" And the rest of us were like, ""Okay, thanks for pointing that out. Pretty smart."" We were smart enough to know he was right, and so we just, by fund three, had gotten rid of the old buyout business. I had to change some people out, and our core group continued - Jon, Tim, myself, Juan. We continued together and started scaling our fund business in and around this idea of more later stage growth equity technology, and we wereone of the first firms in the world to do that later stage stuff.The early stage investing was still being done off the balance sheet in a vehicle of Valor R&D because forour clients at the time, that wasn't a thing yet. People didn't know how to classify it. So we were continuing to do the seed, series A, early stage venture off the balance sheet. By the time we get to fund four, the clients figure out, oh man, you've got things like Uber. And then another important chapter is my partner, Jon Shulkin, created an opportunity for the firm to start a dedicated venture fund in food tech, retail tech, sustainability, in partnership with Starbucks, and he's got four or five different corporate clients there. And we talked about whether we should do this or not. I asked the question, ""Are we going to be uniquely valuable? The world doesn't need another capital allocator."" And the answer was, we are going to be uniquely valuable. But what early stage companies really need is revenue, and so if our growth funds are doing scale and we're helping people scale, what early stage companies need is revenue, we're going to create a system that helps early stage companies get revenue from these large corporates and build relationships with large corporates for Biz Dev, which they have done a great job of, the team here has done a great job of. It's been really great, we brought on a partner in Richard Tait to help us do that in the venture fund, and it's worked really well. We're just expanding the team out to work on more verticals now and apply the same ideas and the same methodology across the verticals. We're investing now in consumer and, I'll call it hard tech, SpaceX, blockchain, security technology, almost anything you can conceive of, but it fits inside of a rubric of pro-entropic, resilient, and then we can add that operationally. Patrick: You mentioned earlier this idea of asymmetric information and it's interesting how the private investing world is actually defined by something that's illegal in the public markets, which is privileged information about companies and about people. Gavin told me a lot about this strategy that you've employed, that I think he freely admits he copied, which is a staged deployment of capital strategy into individual companies. You mentioned maybe starting with one, going up to 100 or 200, say a bit more about how that's developed, because it's always struck me as so strange that there are very stage focused. We do series A investments or seed investments only when one of the best advantages in this world is this ongoing accumulation of differential information that you gather as the companies grow. So say a bit more about that. Because I feel like it's a really smart and interesting strategy for deployment. Antonio: We've been doing this for a long time. We almost backed into it by accident because wewere running our venture strategy off our own balance sheet. We learn a lot about companies by writing small checks and just spending time with them. We learn over the years that our best management teams, pretty much everyone misses forecasts, because people are overly optimistic and they should be because they're entrepreneurs. But if you miss more than 25%, it's probably a problem. More than 30%, it is a problem. You will probably never recover. We have data that goes back 25 years at some of this stuff. It's a huge pool of data. You send a team of people out to a company, they're very highly qualified professionals. They're obviously feeding back information on our investment process and we get to know that company really well from the inside. And by the way, they get to know us, because it's a two-way relationship. And once that happens, you solidify the relationship, we build an information advantage. We can make a much better decision about the next check. It may come in at a higher price. We've had people ask us, ""Does it seem fair to you that you're doing all this work? And then you're actually creating some of the conditions that make your price higher the next time around?"" We do it because we're providing valuable service to our companies. We want to make the world better. The companies make the world better, that's how we develop meaning and we all are getting great information.But the reality is we'd rather pay a higher price, more information, less risk. What we're trying to do is movethe entire distribution of the portfolio, the mean distribution over to the right, and increase the size of the fat tail, and reduce the losses. Whether we pay 1x or 2x the price, and it's a year later, two years later, and it's been de-risked substantially, doesn't really matter. The IRR may be lower, the multiple cost might be lower, but the reality is the risk we took was a lot lower. And so the investment itself, the risk-reward dynamic was much better. We're trying to balance a really great asymmetric risk-reward equation.",4464
166,Antonio Gracias - Pro-Entropic Investing,Psychology & Evaluating People," Patrick: It's a great excuse, the concept of risk, to talk probably for a while about one of my favorite things that you and I have talked about, which is the evaluation of people. And this really gets into the world of psychology. You've mentioned your foray into neuroscience a couple of times already, but I think that the ability to understand people, their motivations, the type of person they are, the type of leader they'll be, is incredibly important. Certainly in pro-entropic companies, it probably drives the outcomes. I would love you to take us down this road that you've been on for 15 years or so into the world of psychological research, the theories or ideas that you've found to actually be helpful in investing and why. I just think this is such a rich area of understanding. And I know it's a passion area for you. Antonio: Part of this starts at the story of how I started thinking about this. In the same fund that we did Tesla and SpaceX, we had actually, what turned out to be a Medicaid fraud, and I was just tortured by this. These were things I did, okay, so I'm not blaming anybody but me, I made these decisions. How could it be that I could make some sets of decisions that are just great, and others that are just terrible? And in very close proximity in time. And so I actually went and found a psychologist and theologian named Galen Buckwalter, who thinks about some of these questions, and asked him to help me figure it out. We started thinking about, could we create a cultural test to help us understand people better? And one of the things he studies is people that have a brain anomaly that their amygdala doesn't fire properly and clinically we call these people psychopaths.The reality is that I want to be careful with that word, because it's got a very negative connotation. But if you watch the movie Free Solo, you see Alex Honnold, he just doesn't feel risk and anxiety the same way that people might. And some of these folks go on to do great things, some of them can be criminals. And one of the things he pointed out to me is, look, when you have someone who might commit a fraud, and they're high performing, there's no way to figure this out ex ante. You really have to have known them and watched them, because they're really good at it. And if they're clinical, they're probably already in jail, but if they're high IQ and subclinical, they're probably in your office, and that's the kind of people we try to sort out.And so he took us through trying to learn how to think about this problem of sorting out people that really didn't fit for us in terms of values, and sorting in people that were really good. And I think the key learning that I would share with you is this: he told us about 5% of the human population has this brain anomaly and they concentrate in areas like finance, law, entrepreneurship, politics, et cetera, all the power professions. And that we should think about it as probably 10% of the people we deal with are going to do things that we don't like, other people might like them, we don't like them. They don't fit for our values just because of the nature of how they think and the way their brain operates, their actual, physical brain operates.And so we changed our base rate forecast. We do base rate forecasting here on our investments all the time. What's the probability of a 3x, what’s the probability of a 5x? We weren't base rate forecasting people. Most people I talk to, if I said to them, ""Hey, what percent of people do you think walk in your office, sit down for a meeting, just are not telling you the truth and think it's okay? Not that they're not telling the truth and think it's not okay, but they're not telling the truth and think it is okay?"" Most people would say none. I would've said zero before I heard this. And so we raised our base rate forecast to 10% and it's actually helped a lot, because you’d say, think about it as a base rate toward 10%. It should take you six or nine months to figure it out.And so, one of the reasons that six month thing happened is, as we get to know people, and they get to know us, one of the questions we're asking ourselves, ""Are our values aligned?"" That doesn't mean someone's bad or good. We have our set of values, other people their values. And if our values are very misaligned, we've found over the years that we're just not going to enjoy the experience, which means you won't be great partners, they won't be good partners for us, and that's not good for anyone. And our values, they’re here up on the wall in the conference room, humility, integrity, responsibility, and excellence. These are the things you believe in, we believe in it for ourselves; we hold ourselves accountable to it and we want to work with people that do the same thing.It takes us about six to nine months to figure out whether or not we match up on that stuff, and that's why this small check goes in first then we get to know each other, and once we match up, I think we're great partners. We will go to bat for you, we will go to war for you. We will, 100%. But we’ve got to believe that the values matched up. And then it continued and we went deeper in the neuroscience, we brought in a woman, Laura Harrison, who's been working on some of the stuff we're talking about here. She's got a PhD in the neuroscience of emotion from CalTech, and she's brilliant. The things that I'm telling you about with decision-making have come from the work that we've had with this team of Galen and Laura and some of our folks internally, thinking about how we are understanding decision-making, and how we make better decisions, and how we analyze other people making decisions. And soon, how we can help train other people to makebetter decisions. Patrick: I remember from Peter Thiel's book, where it showed a bell curve distribution, and then there was this inverted bell curve where, at the bottom, it was nearest to the X axis, and then the distribution of founders was typically higher in these extreme characteristics. So maybe, a non-normal amygdala, as you point out, is one of those things that might define the edge of the distribution where you find a lot of entrepreneurs, founders, power positions, etcetera. So walk me through a little bit more that understanding the line. Is it generally true that the people that have been behind the most successful companies you've been involved with, maybe are unique in this way? Their amygdala is different, or something else about their psychology is different? Antonio: I definitely think it's true their brains are different, and it is probably small differences, but they're different. The ability to take pressure and still think clearly is very important. Most people, when they're under extreme pressure and the risks are very high, so existential risk to a company, and the pressure's very high, their emotional system will go off, their limbic system will go off, and they'll make bad decisions.Theranos - how do you reconcile that? It's because that's a series of bad decisions occur because they were probably feeling in a high threat environment because they were going to fail, and they just started doing bad things. And one after the other, after the other, it gets deeper and deeper. The great executives are those that are under that pressure and they actually make better decisions. They are pro-entropic thinkers, that's where it comes from. And I haven’t brain scanned these folks but my impression is that many of them are actually very compassionate.So the same place you find anxiety, you find compassion. They're very compassionate people, but just because of their experience in life, childhood, the way their brain operates, the way their emotional systems mediate into their prefrontal cortex, whatever it is, they are able to really make great decisions despite being under extreme pressure at existential moments, and do the right thing.They understand the line. There's always this line, there's truth and there's not truth. There's people lying, there's people telling the truth. And I think that we have been able to figure out the difference there, and there is a real difference there. And the very best people know where that line is, they don't cross it. They know they're pushing the edges of execution, so they're driving people super hard to execute really, really well, but they're telling the truth. And I think that's a very important distinction.So that bell curve does exist, but on the successful end, I promise you that those folks have good ethics and values, or they wouldn't build great companies that last. Patrick: One of the things that I'm completely fascinated by is when leaders have to motivate people, teams, stakeholders, whatever, to facilitate huge change. Elon's probably the prime example in the world today. You have to set extremely ambitious goals. Elon's been criticized, maybe for setting goals that he couldn't hit, or didn't hit fast enough. What have you learned about the vision setting, the narrative building, the communication, and that line? Because sometimes things aren't a lie, because they haven't happened or not happened, it's something in the future, and we have to be galvanized. And the best leaders seem to galvanize large swaths of people towards a common goal, and that seems really important. What have you learned about leaders that do that effectively? What are danger spots? I'm really interested in this narrative building thing. Antonio: I think it depends on the kind of goal you're setting. We can pick companies like SpaceX, right? Huge, ambitious goals. I can tell you, I know that Elon believes what he was telling people, because I believed it. I was there. I saw the data, and I know that for some people on the outside it sounded so incredible, it can't be true. I'm on the audit committee, I'm telling you it's true.But I think sometimes the brain can't process the idea that this thing that's so strange to them, could be true. That's one of the hallmarks of greatness, someone who sees something that no one else sees and can realize that goal and that ambition in reality and galvanize people to do it. I find that, at least in our case, it's always been people that are really trying to make the world better. It's hard to galvanize people to work super hard, to dedicate their lives to a mission, that's just about, say making money, it doesn't sustain.Why are mission driven companies better? Why do we believe it? I think we've been one of the few firms who were doing social responsible investment before it was a thing. Why? Because A, we want to, it brings meaning to our lives, to our work, but B, we think these are better companies, because you're attracting people that are going to work very hard, over long periods of time, on a mission that they believe in. SpaceX has galvanized around the mission to Mars. This is true. I would bet a lot that SpaceX achieves its mission to go to Mars. And is it a hundred percent certainty? Nothing's 100% certain. But do they believe it's true? For sure they believe it's true, and I think it is true. In fact, along the way, it's gotten more true, it's a realizable vision. Today, we can absolutely see it as a realizable vision, but if they hadn’t started with the first step, with a bold vision, bold mission. They never would've gotten there.And I think these are very special people that are able to do it. Our partner in biosciences, Jeff Aronin, does really well when they're innovating drugs. People working very hard over many years with no payoff, equity could be worthless for this work. We believe it's going to work. He believes it’s going to work. It's not like in the consumer space where you get product market fit. You keep going. This takes years, and these are brilliant people galvanized around the objective of getting a drug approved. And the last big drug they got approved was narcolepsy and cataplexy. These are terrible conditions, people can't work. And great professionals galvanize around these goals because they believe they're making the world better, and of course, there's a financial payoff, but what really drives them is the mission. And then it's also working with other great people on that mission, like that sense of fellowship, these companies all share that. And these CEOs who are able to create that sense of fellowship, that feeling of mission, and respect among their teams, that they’re really going to change the world, they galvanize the best people to work on these ideas.",2831
167,Antonio Gracias - Pro-Entropic Investing,Combating Bias," Patrick: I love the notion of neuro-stress response being one thing that you uncovered. I think the other category that is really interesting that you've explored is all the different kinds of bias. This could be investment decision making that's affected by your bias or your team's bias, it could be bias on the part of the teams that you're partnering with, it's relevant everywhere. What are the big lessons that you’ve learned about bias specifically and combating it in practice? Antonio: I started thinking about bias because I was making these errors. I was trying to figure out why I'm making these errors. And you read Thinking Fast and Slow, Kahneman and Tversky stuff about cognitive bias. The reality is most qualified decision makers we deal with don't make a lot of cognitive errors.They know how to manage cognitive bias pretty well. And in my case, the errors I was making were not cognitive errors, they were emotional errors. And not much is written about this yet. I'm trying to build something around it now with our team of neuroscience psychologists about emotional bias. And what I learned about myself was, I so wanted this particular company that turned out to be a problem, to work because it was serving mostly minority children, Hispanic and African American children, in Texas for dental. And I so badly wanted it to work, that I just overrode a bunch of yellow lights, because I believed in the mission. It was the right thing for the world.I would say things like, got to make these clinics so great that we would send our own kids there. And we overrode a bunch of yellow lights in our system that we shouldn't have overridden. And when we asked why, and I was coached by Galen and Laura why, the answer was inside of my emotional state.And, in the most simple context, we think about emotional states and bias like limbic hijack. Something happens to you, you get dysregulated, and it takes over your frontal lobe and you can't make a good decision. In a positive context is, you get overly attached to something, because you want to believe it and you really want to be on that mission. And we very carefully check that out here, because we are mission driven in our investments. We have to be careful that we are actually successful in the things we're dealing with, that our emotions and our desire to make something real, don't override our due diligence process and everything else we're doing.So emotional bias is very important and we're doing a lot of work on that. There is a hierarchy to emotional bias, which is security, control, and affirmation. And what really was going on here is my sense of affirmation, about who I am and who I want the firm to be, was being triggered by something that felt really good to do.Ego is an important driver, we want to be affirmed by the things we're doing, and if you're in our state, which is where we're affirmed making the world better, that could actually become dangerous. And so we put a bunch of systems in place to double check that, and internally, to me, I think that the tools to manage that emotional bias state all exist in philosophy today. And if we had accepted the reality of the situation we were in, and did a proper Bayesian update, frankly, we wouldn't have made that decision Patrick: Where do security and control figure into your thinking? You mentioned affirmation and associated ego related decisions, what's the role of security and control in all of this? Antonio: If you are feeling unsafe, your physiologic state will be triggered. That is the most classic triune model of the brain where you have the prefrontal cortex, the white matter, and the limbic system that you see in textbooks and all, that is what gets triggered when you feel lack of security. And this could be physical security. In our context, the problem is that our brain's designed to be on the savanna and see a lion and run, but now we work in offices and talk to each other on Zoom and so we're not threatened the same way. But if you say something that really annoys me, that thing might go off as if my security were threatened. And I think that's actually one of the problems we're having today, is we don't have the right tools to mediate that emotional state of having our security threatened.And control, I think is control of the environment. So I think about it as a hierarchy, we have basic physical security and emotional security, and then control of our environment is that we all feel uncertainty in our minds. And how well we deal with uncertainty, and the chaos on the outside, so external entropy, often determines how well we make decisions in an emotional state. That's hard. When we talk about control that's what I mean, your internal uncertainty relative to the external entropy. How well you deal with that, how it happens, how it works for you, and how you can keep an even state. I think that is quite important as a decision maker. Patrick: This concept of identity that's related to ego has always interested me. With a background in philosophy I always loved the Paul Graham essay, I think the title was Keep Your Identity Small. The idea that when you establish an identity, things you identify as or with, you'll do irrational things to align with that view of your own identity. You'll act to protect this identity you've built up for yourself, even though it's BS typically. Identities are sort of illusory. What have you done personally, to not make those kinds of mistakes? To not make the affirmation ego related? Is it Atul Gawande checklist manifesto type stuff? What are the tools in that toolkit that are actually effective at improving this category of error? Antonio: I'll start with internal things, then the external things. So internally a meditative practice I started several years ago as a young man, then dropped it for a while, then picked it back up again now a little over a decade ago. I started doing TM, transcendental meditation, which is a useful mantra. And I found that that gave me space between my limbic brain and my prefrontal cortex to make even a millisecond decision about how I’m going to respond, how I’m going to feel. And that was very useful to me. After practicing that for a long time, I was able to actually get myself to a place where I could use a mantra to replace the dialogue in your head that’s always going. And one thing that’s important about the dialogue, just to tell you, we tell people a lot, it's not you thinking. It might be you but it's often the source of emotional bias or cognitive bias. It's important to know this, unless we direct it, it's not really always thinking.Thinking is occurring in the background and when you are asleep, and meditation, and TM in particular, opened a space between my limbic system and my prefrontal cortex so I could make a millisecond decision. That is a response that is correct, if it's mediate to the environment, it makes sense or if it doesn't, I should just do nothing and be calm. Over time, what happened to me, I got more deeply into it. I had done some Zen Buddhist meditation when I was in Japan when I was very young. I was able to return to a breathing practice, a meditative practice that is without a mantra, where I could reduce the voice. And this happened to me just a few years ago, I went to Japan with my family, and I went back to my very favorite place on earth, a temple called Ryoanji, outside Kyoto. It's a beautiful zen temple.And I was meditating there on New Year's Day, and it was the first time in my life that I could take the voice down to zero, be in a state of awareness without hearing the voice and just be. This has allowed me to, I think, mediate between my sense of ego and what is really happening in the environment, because there's a space there for me now. It's been really very useful to me, just made my life more pleasant frankly.The other thing I've done here is, I have some wonderful, wonderful partners I work with, very smart people and really great humans. And it's part of our process. If you go look at our underwriting documents, it has bias, it's got cognitive, behavioral and emotional bias in it. And we literally sit around and talk about it. And there's a culture here where I want people to check me and I check them, why are we doing this? Does it really make sense? What are you feeling about it?And having a conversation about feelings around an investment table, I know it sounds a little crazy, when it’s so data driven, but it's important because we want our people to be passionate. We want to be passionate about what we're doing, that's the whole point, we like doing it. We want to make the world better, but at the same time we want to make sure it doesn't override our cognitive systems. And so we have external checks as well, which is more of the checklist manifesto thing, where we're actually just checking off and saying, yeah, we thought about it, we talked about it.We don't even say they don't exist actually, we just identify them. And when we go back in time and look at our errors, cause we still make errors, we will look at the underwriting, look at the numbers, all the qualitative, quantitative stuff we do, we'll look at the bias states; we'll look and see if we made a mistake. If we miss a bias, did something happen there? Patrick: Japanese language is very distinctive. I love the idea that the type of language you speak is a programming for the brain. Talk us through the lessons you learned from, maybe Japanese language specifically, versus Western languages and the lessons that might hold for us. Because I think it is esoteric but a super interesting topic. Antonio: I studied Japanese very intensely when I was at Georgetown. And one of the things that occurred to me when I was living in Japan was that the language itself has a different grammatical pattern than Western languages. You have markers, like subject, object, and you can move them around the sentence. And in those days it was always, people thought about Japan and Japanese as, yes isn’t a yes, and it's like this circular logic pattern going on. And it occurred to me that it was actually different, the logic was different because the grammar was different, and the language was different. And so these miscommunications that were occurring were occurring because the language itself was programming the brain.If you sat all of us in a room: me, you, a Japanese person, someone from Spain or Eastern Europe, whatever, scan the brain, virtually all the same, small variances in parts of the brain or whatever, but we're all the same. The language and culture we live in is what programs our brain. And as we talked about it, it became programming. And as time went on, I started figuring out that, look, I could use this language in the brain, in the form of a mantra to help change my brain.And if you go research this, compassion meditation, where you can see that in advanced compassion meditators, the amygdala thickens, it grows. So it's one of the things that's influenced me now, and we're actually not that different at all. What makes us different in any way is probably the language we learned as children, and the cultural programming that comes along with it. That's all that really makes us different. It was a profound thought for me. It connected me to people in a very different way.",2563
168,Antonio Gracias - Pro-Entropic Investing,Ground Truths Working with Teams," Patrick: The through line, not to get too deep into philosophy, of reality and respecting reality, is really interesting in this part of the conversation, but it really is part of the investing part too, because I think the thing that drew me to your firm and style of investing so much was this operations focus, which fundamentally is reality. What's actually happening in these companies, not what they're saying, but what is actually happening. What have you learned about applying that concept to evaluating a business? Whether it's in this six month period or even an ongoing basis, what have you gotten better at when it comes to really getting to the heart of reality, and learning reality inside of a business, which, each one of them is very complex, it's hard to know reality... But this operations focus to me seems like this great connection with what's actually going on, which is used less than it should be in the world of technology investing, and I'm just really curious how you've honed that, and how you and the team apply that in practice. Antonio: I think we are often in situations where we're dealing with visionary leaders. And as you said, they're holding these giant visions that they're executing as well. And they've got these, I say big probability option sets, and then they're also executing on individual day to day matters. And I think that's what makes them so special, is that there is a real acceptance of reality. The truth is the truth, ground truth. And the very best executives we have, I've never really had arguments. It's like, what is the truth? Get the data, go figure it out, come back, let's make some decisions. And you know when you're having a problem with reality matching, you can either get objective truth, figure it out or there's a judgment to make, and obviously we're not in charge, we don't want to be in charge, the judgment is made by the CEO, but our job is to get the facts on the table and come to some conclusion.But 90 plus percent of the time, it's pretty obvious when you have the right facts. And when you don't have the right facts, then you have disagreements. But we live in a time when I think truth is somewhat becoming relative. Your perspective, my perspective, and it's all viable. This is not true in business, there are actually objective facts. There are numbers, there's a product, there's engineering, drawings, the thing works, it doesn't work, super simple. It is or is not. And the very best executives are really great at that.You mentioned Elon a little bit, he is just amazing at that. He is a first principles, ground truth decision maker, he wants the facts, and if you have the facts, it's super easy. And so when we see that, it's a great pattern match for us, that this is a really great executive who our values align with. We think about what integrity and excellence mean for us. Epistemic humility, means you are intellectually humble. You want to find ground truth. You don't care what you think today, you want the right answer. Integrity means you actually want to get that answer. It's all about that. It's all about what's real ground truth. Let's have some agreement on that first and then make decisions. Patrick: Do you have favorite questions that you find yourself returning to again and again, as you're getting to know a business or a founding team early on, that are typically illuminating for you? Antonio: The reality is we're in these businesses for a long period of time. Want to be valuable partners. We want to be invested for many, many years, and sometimes now coming up for about two decades in some of these companies. And we want that, that's Nirvana for us. We're with someone for 20 years, that's amazing. We want to be valuable partners, we want to be there in good times and bad. And I think the questions you might ask about a long term relationship that's going to be with a friend or with a colleague, you want to respect and be with, are the same questions we ask. Patrick: Is another way of saying that, just testing for points of trust? Doing what you say you're going to do. Is there more to trust than that? Antonio: I think you could say that we trust that you are going to deliver on what you're telling us you're going to deliver. And we trust that you have a common view of first principles thinking and ground truths that we do. We learn that over time. Cause it's not just that we trust that they're going to do this, they're going to do it. It's that we also know that they're arriving at those conclusions in a way that's a logic pattern that makes sense to us, which is, ""Hey, what are the facts? What's ground truth here? Then from first principles, let's build up the right answer."" If there's an error, they do good root cause analysis with highly qualified cognitive thinkers. Then I guess on the emotional side, the emotions will be in check enough to make rational decisions. So all that leads to a sense of trust, yes. Patrick: Because you've got this unique angle of the operational support that can be actually forward deployed into businesses, meaning Valor teammates are literally going and working at the companies, which again is, I think everyone would love to say they did that, but not that many actually forward deploy teams. What have you learned about how founders accept or don't, or ask for or don't ask for, help, because one of the tropes that you hear sometimes is you want to back founders that don't need the investor's help. They're just going to figure it all out themselves. So what have you learned about the information content of offering and then deploying help with these companies? Antonio: I think the vast majority of people that we deal with don't need our help. We're like insurance. We could make things go faster, easier. We have a lot of reps. The kind of problems that we're dealing with are repeated problems for us, but they're the first time through it for a first time founder. We will lower the risk. We will lower the pain. We'll increase the speed, and if something really goes wrong, we can help you fix it. That's why you want us.We don't want to invest in people that actually need us, but when you're dealing with figuring out which capital partner you want, well, some people actually want help, and some people don't. I don't value judge that, but our kind of people, we're very clear about who we are, what we want to do, and it's a good sorting mechanism for us. I ask that question of so many, ""What are your top three problems?"" They say something like, ""I have no problems."" Then I think we probably have a ground truth problem, in the sense that everyone has problems. I got problems in my business. You got problems in your business. We all have problems our business. If you don't, you’re not paying attention.If they say, ""Look, we have five issues, but we don't really want anyone to help us, and that's the way it is."" Okay, great, probably not for us. I think there was a period of time when our resources were unknown and not very well qualified. Now, you can read about them in books and you can reference check us with dozens of people to see if we’re good at it. So it really comes down to a self-selecting mechanism. If you want a partner that wants to be valuable to you, wants to be more than just capital, that wants to help you, I think we are actually the best people around for that. If all you want is capital and don’t want us to show up or want us at board meetings, probably not the right people for you and that's okay. There's a lot of people in the world, lot of great companies in the world, lot of great CEOs. We're just looking for the ones that like what we do. Patrick: You mentioned at the beginning this great example around the theory of constraints with the nickel baths, past the operating career in the Valor period, what episode of operational deployment and work most stands out in your memory, a fun example of, ""There was a big problem. We were part of fixing it."" Antonio: One from COVID I would tell you is we have a company here called Misfits, which is basically selling produce that doesn't quite fit the grocery store channel direct to a middle class consumer. In COVID this was super important because people needed food and if you remember, there were food shortages. So this company's in Philadelphia. We deployed a team in the middle of COVID. I was so proud of our teams. COVID was in full rage. They actually drove through barriers because Philadelphia, where they were going, had riots, and went to their facility and helped them actually scale the facility up to serve more customers. Then we helped them build another one out West. It's those moments that make it real for us.There's been lots of well-documented operating stories at Tesla, where I personally spent part of the summer 2018 in the factory there along with my partner, Tim Watkins, helping scale model 3 production. That time, I tell you, was one of the most rewarding times of my career. Patrick: What were you literally doing? Antonio: There were issues ramping the factory. I was working on, call it the paintshop forward to the backend of the line, Elon and other executives were working on the body shop and other stuff, we were working the whole thing, but just supporting the guys as they were trying to ramp the facility and helping to do some of the theory constraints you were talking about and manage to improve throughput. And my partner, Tim, was there, who is a brilliant engineer, helping on the engineering side. I think back on that moment as one of the proudest parts of my career personally because I feel like I really made a difference and I liked doing it. I really do like being on a factory floor, working with folks, making a product. Can't do it every day. But that was a great personal moment for me. Patrick: What would be like one task in the factory procedure that you were involved with? Antonio: Here's one thing we did: the cars would come out of the end of line, they'd already been painted, come to the line assembled and then they were being charged directly in that area and then sent to the end of line retrofication area where we make sure all the fit, finish is good. And the issue was, I can't remember exact numbers, but let's say it took three or four hours to charge a car. They’d just sit there, they don't move.Now when you're trying to ramp a factory, that's a long time and a lot of inventory just sitting there and remember velocity and quality are related. So one of the things we did was we actually moved some of these teams that were checking the final quality of the car and rectifying all this stuff you do at the end of line. We actually developed, built a bunch of supercharge stations at the end of the line and then moved those teams, instead of being in a separate location, onto the cars while they were being charged. So this just increased the speed of the system pretty substantially, because you weren't sitting doing nothing and then moving. You were actually working on the car while it was actually charging. Because they had to be in a partial charge state to be shipped, to make sure the battery charged and the car had to be tested, et cetera. It's this kind of stuff. Where is the constraint in my system? Well, if I have a car just sitting there doing nothing for a long amount of time, that's a constraint quite obviously in that part of the system. Patrick: Elon's concept of vector sum, creating alignment on teams in a certain direction is really interesting to me. It's always these physics references with him, obviously with the physics background. Can you talk a bit about what you've learned from him specifically? I think your longest standing member of Tesla's board, only just recently, not part of the board. Whether it's vector sum or other key concepts that you think are high attribution concepts that have led to the outcomes of those companies, as you reflect on that, what do you think of? Antonio: One of the things that I feel really allowed us to work so closely for so long was this idea that the theory of constraints is really about the force vectors going through a system. And are they aligned or not? This is true of human decision making and teams. Make decisions, that decision has force and directions in the world. And it goes out and interacts. We talked about it a little earlier. These are all force vectors. He has a very similar theory, which is everyone's efforts add up in a team and they drive forward together. This is really important in any business, which is you're only the sum total of all of your activity together and any counter vectors in the system just drive counter activity. And if you don't have a common direction, a common mission and people aren't driving their efforts in the same direction, you won't get forward movement.And one of the reasons these, I think mission-driven companies just do better than other companies is that you're more likely to sublimate whatever you want to the overall mission of the company if you really believe it and you believe it's going to make a big difference. And your life's energy that you're putting into that company, you're taking your decisions and the energy of your actions, which is really all you have in this life, is your time and energy. Where you put energy in that time, you're putting it toward a goal, toward an objective. And if you believe that objective really matters to humanity, you're more likely to want to do it and do it in a way that's really good for the company and not worry too much about what's good just for you as an individual. I think it's a very important lesson. It's one that I've incorporated here and that we think about as executives. And it's how I think about decision making now.Your life is the sum total of all the decisions you make and how those vectors add up and if the vectors are going in a positive direction, they have force momentum, your life will get better, your contentment level will get better. If they're going negative, they compound over time negatively and things get worse.I often give executives this book: ""Into Thin Air."" It is a great description of the compounding effect and bad decisions. It's not the first decision that's kill them. It's the last decision they make and they make a series of very bad decisions along the way because they're emotionally engaged. They're not thinking clearly. That is 100% what we're talking about here. The vectors of their decisions are adding up in a negative way. And at some point they can't recover and they die. This is actually extremely important for life. It's my basic philosophy in life, which is, my decisions matter, your decisions matter. And Elon's construct would be, ""they're all adding up in a team or a company and they're driving a certain direction, if they drive in that direction effectively, we'll get forward movement and we'll build something great."" Patrick: If we think about the theory of constraints applied to the overall system, call it the market system, the economy, it seems like the bottleneck might be we need more Elon's, we need more Bezos'. We need more pick your small handful of people that have seemed to have been able to build these transformative companies and then industries. Why is that the constraint? Why aren't there 50 Elon's? Why aren't there a hundred Bezos'? Antonio: I would say that talent is a constraint, period. Those very, very special brains, it would be great if there were more of those, but frankly, if there were more people that were just really, really great, they could scale those brains, we would do more stuff. So if you said to me, ""if I could wave a magic wand today, would I put 10 more Elon's on earth or 10 more Bezos' on earth or would I put a million more super talented executives, engineers, et cetera, to scale what those people are doing today?"" I think the constraint is actually having great people that are going to go on a mission and help scale the things we already have in motion today. Patrick: If we keep pulling on that thread, the reason there aren't more of them, is that an education problem? Is it an immigration problem in the US? If we're trying to improve that bottleneck, how do we do it? Antonio: In the US, all these things. I think the easy solution is immigration. We definitely have a demographic problem. We look at the employment participation ratio here quite carefully and it was about around 60% right after COVID, during COVID, that's the same level that it was at in the early seventies when women entered the workforce. So if you think about 40% of eligible people aren't working. Roughly now it's about 62%, which is approximately where we were pre-COVID, but it had been coming down from the mid sixties to 62-63 pre-COVID. This is really bad. You cannot create productivity without people working. So why aren't people working?About 30% of it's resulting from the aging population, but 70% of it is not described by this. It's just other people leaving the workforce for many reasons. And we need people to be productive for sure. So I think it's a combination of getting people that should be working today, that aren't working, back in the workforce, as we're bringing more young people through the system, actually educating them well and not everyone has to go to college.It would be great to have a very good vocational training system in this country where people are respected for being a tool maker or making stuff. And I think as we geopolitically think about how we want to bring things back from Asia, back from Europe, which is very important for America. The only company in this country at this point making cells is Tesla. We don't make chips in this country. We don't make pharma in this country. There are a lot of things we don't make. Think about making those things just for strategic reasons, for security reasons. We need more people that can actually make stuff and want to work in factories making stuff. Very important that the education system is behind that.And the third thing I think you're totally right. We need immigration. America is a country of immigrants. My parents are immigrants. You look at business formation, a very large percentage of business formation in America comes from immigrants or children of immigrants. And I'm saddened by the idea that somehow immigration is pathologized on both sides of the aisle in Washington. I think that's just crazy. We are a country of immigrants. People want to work. They're smart, hardworking, great. Let them in. Let them work. I don't think that's taking jobs away from people who are here today. We don't have enough people today that want to work. Patrick: As you think about the system that is Valor and its future, a few questions there. First is how do you ensure that you are seeing and aware of the best potential opportunities going forward? Obviously you can't invest in something that you don't know exists and they don't know you exist. How do you solve that problem in an increasingly competitive market to supply companies with capital? Antonio: I'm going to answer this question in a little more open algorithmic way, which is, I think about the problems in our investing process as a false positive, you make a mistake, I’m okay with that. Because our aperture is pretty narrow and our loss ratio is good. A false negative, we say no to something we shouldn't have. A miss, it's in our pipeline today, we just don't do anything with it, we miss it. And then we just didn't see it all.Our biggest problem today is, in our pipeline today and we miss it. Because we have hundreds of companies in our pipeline that we are following because of our strategy of write a small check and then scale up. And we don't have enough people actually to really follow them all carefully. And that's one that bothers me most. We are building technology here to solve that problem, working on some software currently to solve that problem.The fourth problem, which is we didn't see it at all, is a problem. But look, if we just got everything that went in our pipeline, that was good. We could fill up our funds and then we would be very happy. I am going to work on the fourth problem. More because I think it's the right thing to do than because I think we have a lack of opportunity here. And that is by continuing to scale up our strategy in investing, I'd say earlier stage, to help our companies. We're trying to figure out how to take some of our operations work and package it in a way that it is kind of self deployable, something where we could say, ""here's our sales operations toolkit. It's a $2 million investment. We can't send you a team. We can't justify it, but we can give you some information about how you could do better, be better and maybe have a call with somebody to help you."" And if we did that, we would then also go back a little further and do more seed. Just make the world better by trying to help more people do the right thing is why I would do it. And I think it's the right thing to do. We're thinking about it carefully. Patrick: There's this interesting concept that my friend Graham Duncan introduced me to called Source. Somebody takes the first risk to found some business and they tend to carry a sacred flame. They have the ethos of the thing in themselves. Often it's a reflection of their own personality and notoriously in business, especially in investment businesses, it's very hard to pass the flame. Succession is very difficult. Multi-generational firms where it's sequences of partners that are all successful is a rarity in the investing world. How do you think about this as it relates to Valor? You were the person to take the first risk and carry that flame for Valor, how do you think about making sure it doesn't get extinguished when you're done? Antonio: We are thinking about it a lot because I'm at a stage where I continue to do what I'm doing because I believe we're adding value to the world and I want it to survive me and we have some great partners here. It all begins with people. My partners Juan and Jon are amazing, some of our younger folks coming up are great. And I think carefully about how we are inculcating our culture. And we're doing a lot of work on that now. We use this term called fellowship, which is this moment where you as an individual feel like you’re growing, your purpose is fulfilled because the mission is great, and you have respect for the people you're working with. When all those three things line up, you feel great about going to work. When I'm in a meeting, we're talking about a company we all believe in and we all want to get behind. That feels great when the teams are together and we're in those moments of fellowship, we're trying to inculcate that in a way that's more organized.Those of us who've been together for a long time and who tend to be in the partnership group, we're turning our operations tools on ourselves. So we're often asked this question by some of our companies. And one of our great pro-entropic CEOs, Josh Motta, who is the CEO and Founder of Coalition. And I was thinking about, ""man, how do I inculcate the culture,"" I started asking some of the CEOs I really respect who are, I'd say, at a demographic that they really understand the millennial and the post-COVID world. So Josh is probably in his early thirties or something. And I asked him, ""Hey, what are you doing? And how do you think about this with the fully distributed workforce and the office is closed and how you keep culture great.” He said, ""we use this book called 'Legacy.'""And it's interesting because legacy's one of the books that we use. This book is by James Kerr. I recommend it to anyone listening to the podcast. It's about the New Zealand All Blacks, which is the most winning sports team of all time. And when you get into it, you'll see it as an ethos of servant leadership, which is what we believe in here. And we've actually been working with James. We've hired him to help us think about our cultural program here and how we design it, inculcate it, eventually use, and how we're going to build it. And we're mid flight on this right now, Patrick, it's super important to us to get it right. We're working on it as we speak. Patrick: I have so deeply enjoyed learning about your investing style. I think some of the core ideas that drive what you do really make you think. And when you start applying these questions or big lenses to companies, it's interesting how quickly you get to know if you have a standard that's differentiated and how easy it is to say no to a company even if the people seem great and the market seems fine and so many other things check the box. So I've really appreciated everything you've taught me over the last couple of years. I ask everyone the same traditional closing question: what is the kindest thing that anyone's ever done for you? Antonio: I've never actually told this story outside of a very, very close set of friends and colleagues. So I'll tell it to you and it's going to get me a little emotional, but I'll tell it to you. When my mother died, she died of a heart attack in a hospital and I was there. She was in an angio room, and I got to see her before they did the angiogram and she actually passed away. And I went in that room and she held my hand and she said to me in Spanish, “Te quiero”, and she said, “se valiente”, which means I love you and be courageous. And I think that's the kindest thing anyone has ever done for me. That at the end of her life, what she thought of was telling her son to be courageous, I think, knowing that she was going to die. Patrick: Absolutely incredible. I think I've asked that question 400 times. Not sure I've heard one quite like that. It's very kind of you to share it. Amazing, incredible story and how simple and beautiful and lovely. Antonio: Whenever I get into a situation where I'm not sure what to do or I ask myself what the right thing to do is, I think of her and I think of that moment in particular and it becomes very clear what I'm supposed to do. It's one of the reasons I'm on a mission to try to make the world better. Patrick: Can you say a bit more about your mom? I'm just curious what she was like and what you remember about her characteristically. Antonio: My mom was an extraordinary woman. Came to this country, didn't speak English, raised four of us and was just a great motivator for me. I always hold her like the Virgin Mary in my life. It’s perfect and caused me some problems. And I had to come to terms with the fact that she was a real human like the rest of us, but she was a deeply, very loving woman who was super supportive of, I think, my father and her children and gave as much as she could to us. And really imbued in all of us, a sense of responsibility and that we were, my siblings and I, are talented people. We’ve all gone on to do interesting things with our lives and that we needed to give back to society. That we were responsible. That this is why we're here, that we are to care for each other. And that sense of compassion and care and hard work. My father was very hard working. He wasn't home a lot, he set a standard that we work really hard and she was setting a standard of you really care about each other and you care about people. I remember watching how she interacted with people, how much she cared about them and how that made them feel.That's what I remember about her, being very loving, very caring, very giving, and very focused on the idea that, ""yes, you're a smart, talented kid, but man, you should be humble and you're responsible to give back because that's what we do.""

169,"David Rubenstein - Life, Leadership, and LBOs",Introduction," Patrick: My guest today is David Rubenstein, co-founder of the Carlyle Group, one of the largest private equity firms in the world. David has worked in the White House, built a $300 billion investment institution, become a prominent philanthropist, publish books, and even host his own TV show. It was a thrill to sit down with him and cover the whole spectrum of his experience as a father, investor, historian, and titan of American business. Please enjoy this great conversation with David Rubinstein.",115
170,"David Rubenstein - Life, Leadership, and LBOs",David's Perspective on Today's World," Patrick: David, as you review all the things you've done with your life, one of the underlying themes that's very consistent is I would classify you as an American patriot of sorts, that so much of your interest and work and writing and interviews has been in and around the American system itself. And we sit here today at a very interesting time for that system, given that we're all talking and thinking about the war in Ukraine with Russia, the Chinese system, which is very distinct from our own. And I would love to just hear your perspective on the world today, which seems to be much more maybe chaotic and volatile are the right words, than if you compared it to the last 40 years, given your unique of experiences, but also the clear interest that you have in the American experiment and the American system overall. David: Well, thank you very much for inviting me. I'm honored to be on your show. Russia/Ukraine is something that's top of mind for me, because as the global economy is beginning to recover, or was beginning to recover from COVID, we now find ourselves in a free fall a bit in terms of the global economy. We're seeing a dramatic decline in obviously the Russian economy and obviously the Ukrainian economy, but it's spilling over in the European economy and to some extent in the US economy. So until that issue is resolved, I don't think we're going to really know how the global economy is going to perform over the next year or so. My own view is that Putin made a miscalculation. Obviously he thought this would be a walk in the park and it turned out not to be. And as a result, he now is scrambling, in my view, to negotiate the best possible position for himself, from which to negotiate an exit or an off ramp.In other words, he's not going to conquer Ukraine, almost certainly. And he certainly can't hold Ukraine, even if he could conquer it. So he now realizes this is not what he once thought and his economy is collapsing. Whether it will collapse before Ukraine is beaten to a pulp, not clear. He's clearly using higher level weapons than he was before and he's trying to gain other people's support, getting mercenaries to come in, getting China to try to come in and support him with military equipment. My own view is that within the next two weeks or so, some kind of truce is likely to occur because I think the Russian economy is collapsing so quickly that I think he's afraid that he will not be able to sustain what he's doing much longer. And I think he'd want to make sure he's in control the Russia and not lose control of Russia. So I think he'll work out some deal, but I don't know that the deal will be one that is so wonderful from what he thought he was going to get. Patrick: Obviously the toothpaste is somewhat out of the container, as it were, because you can't undo what's happened in Ukraine so far. What do you think the implications of this are longer term for just the spheres of influence or the state of sort of global powers? David: This has changed everything in this respect. And it's always dangerous to say this time is different or this is the most important thing that's happened since whatever. That's always dangerous and people like to always make it sound like they're living through the greatest tragedy or greatest triumph of all time. The truth is the reason this is very important is this: one, this is the first time since the Cold War where you've had a chance where Russia and the US and Russia and NATO countries could militarily be in a conflict. We're coming very close to that. I mean, Russia bombed something just a few miles from Poland the other day and they do something in Poland. If they were to bomb Poland by accident, or maybe not by accident, under article five of the NATO agreement, we're all required to go in and fight, but we never have had a war against a nuclear power, a physical war in this way.So how do you deal with all that? Nobody really knows. Another thing that's very important is this: if you put your money in a bank, you assume, certainly since the FDIC came along, that your money's going to be good, at least to the amount of money you put in. And nobody believes that the banks in the United States are going to be completely collapsing or that you won't get your money back. The countries had the same view. So Russia took two thirds of its foreign reserves and put them in banks in the United States and around the world. Well, now that money's frozen, so they don't have that money. So now for the first time countries are saying, ""Wait a second, maybe my money isn't secure."" Suppose your China and you're saying, ""Well, maybe we do want to look at Taiwan or maybe we do want to do something.""They have $2 billion in US treasury bills... $2 trillion, $2 trillion. So are they going to look at those $2 trillion as being safe and they can get it any time they want? Suppose the world finally comes together and says, ""We're going to do this again."" So it's going to change the way people look at depositing their money in places. It's also going to change the way people look at the US dollar, I think. The dollar has been the reserve currency, but it clearly is not a currency that's as favorable to Russia and China as it might be to the United States or Western Europe. So we're going to see a lot of changes, but how nuclear powers can fight with each other and how close we come to actually using nuclear weapons is a real issue. Patrick: What are you most concerned about or thinking about most as it pertains to the US, specifically they're role in all of this, the system settings that we have, the rule of law, the natural resources, et cetera, in terms of how we're positioned in this kind of new, radically different world? David: In this world, we've done something that was good, you might argue, depending on your point of view. We've tried for years to get NATO to be stronger militarily and get NATO to be more united. Putin managed to that. He united NATO in a way that no president's been able to do it. He's gotten the Germans to increase their defense spending in ways that nobody else has been able to do it. So in that sense, there's been a positive, which is to say, assuming they keep with it, you've got NATO and the United States more closely aligned before, and we've now shown that the world can move quickly to isolate somebody in a way we've never seen before. No country as big as Russia has ever been so isolated from the world economically and financially, as we've now seen. So in that case, we've learned a lot.In terms of the impact on the US economy though, whatever the outcome is, and let's assume there's some outcome negotiated in the next couple weeks or so, clearly the US will be involved in some kind of help to rebuild Ukraine, would be my guess, along with other people. And I also think that many people are going to look at whether the US economy is now going to be needing some stimulus in some ways. We're increasing interest rates. The fed will this week increase interest rates for the first time in quite some time. How much more can they increase and not hurt the US economy? Because the US economy stalled a little bit. It was growing back after COVID, but now it's going to be stalling a little bit because of Russia.Let me give you an example. Right now, it's very difficult to do certain things, even though politically, the world is united. You can't have over flights over Russia. So if you're an American airline and you want to fly from Europe to China, you can't do that right now. If you want to ship certain things from some parts of the world, you're going to have a hard time going across certain borders. It'll have some impact on our economy, for sure. And we've now also learned how interrelated the global economy really is in the last couple years through COVID and this. And now increasingly I think the US economy is going to try to be more insular and not be so dependent on supply chains all over the world and be so dependent on things that we can't control. Patrick: That's definitely part of the answer to my next question, which is what will happen to people that are just doing business here in the US? What kinds of behavior will we start to see in response to their concerns over things like inflation, over things like reduced globalization, maybe not de-globalization? How do you think this impacts behavior for businesses in the US? David: Inflation is coming back for the first time since I was in the White House. We had inflation in the mid teens in those days. I think it's probably going to peak this year. The annual inflation rate this year, when it's all said and done, will probably be somewhere around 5%, 6%. It's obviously higher right now, but that's a bit of a temporary phenomenon because of what's going on in Russia. But by the end of the year, I think when you look back, we'll probably be maybe %5 or 6%. So people who haven't had to ever worry about inflation are now beginning to do so. People will change their conduct. They may buy things in advance, in greater quantities because they're afraid prices will go up, ask for higher salaries and wages because they think that their cost of living is going up. Businesses will have to respond to that. And the price of everything you buy day to day is probably going to go up.And what you find with inflation is that if somebody says, ""Well, I have to increase prices because of inflation,"" people say, ""Well no, you don't have to. You don't really need to."" People understand that. And therefore you get a consensus that yes, I will pay more for this product at McDonald's, or yes, I will pay more for this show than I have to go see or I want to go see. It builds into the system. Paul Volcker used to say that once inflation gets into the system, it's very, very difficult to get out of it. We're talking about now, for example, the inflation rate let's say is right now, month over month, last month it was close to 8%. The fed is going to increase interest rates on Wednesday by 25 basis points, but that is a drop in the bucket compared to what Paul Volcker did. Paul Volcker increased interest rates by 200 basis points in one weekend. One weekend. And it obviously had some dilatory effects on the global economy and on our own economy. I don't suggest that we should do something like that. And I think the fed is doing the right thing, but you should recognize that as we do begin to increase interest rates, it will slow down the economy. And when you have inflation and high interest rates, that's not a good combination. Patrick: Is it fair to say that you think inflation is fundamentally a reflexive phenomenon, inflation expectations are what drives inflation, in the way you just described? David: It's a self-fulfilling thing. If you think there's inflation and you read there’s inflation, then all of a sudden you get to act like there's inflation. So yes, it does have that impact. But when you go to the gasoline pump and see that gasoline is now $4.50, a gallon or $5 or $4, you see it every day right in front of you. So it does make you think differently about inflation for some time. For 25 years, our inflation rate's been more or less 2% or less, and we couldn't get inflation. We couldn't buy inflation. We thought if we wanted more inflation, we couldn't get it. Now we don't have that problem, but now it's getting the point where people are nervous about it. And that will have an impact on the way everything is priced in this economy.",2642
171,"David Rubenstein - Life, Leadership, and LBOs",Lessons from Great Leaders and Interviewers," Patrick: As I studied the way that you seem to learn, which very much seems to be after my own heart, it seems like in many projects, your default or bias is to go to the best people in the world that have differing viewpoints that have had a lot of success and sort of form a synthetic view of a given topic. You've done this a lot of times in books and shows that you've done, I'm sure at Carlyle, through business through your whole career. What is the source of that style of learning? If you had to trace that thread all the way back to its beginning, talk me through that. David: When I was growing up, there's a Yiddish word, the Yiddish word is called yenta. A yenta is a busy body who wants to know everything. And I think my mother always would say, when we had guests coming to our house, my mother would say, ""Don't ask them all the questions all the time. You're being yenta. It's none of your business."" So I think I probably always had that curiosity. And then I think I've always had an intellectual curiosity, because I always want to know more so I'm always reading things. And just like you, you want to read as much as you can learn about as much as you can. Now because of the position I'm in, I can get some of the best leading people in any given sphere, I can ask them questions and I get access to them so I like to take advantage of it. Just as you on this podcast can get almost anybody you want to come on and you can ask them questions, I'm in a similar position sometimes and I can ask people a lot of questions and I take advantage of it and get the best expert to tell me what's going on. Patrick: When you're with somebody, what is your method? And maybe what's changed about that method over time? David: I generally ask people questions that I'm seriously interested in, but I don't try to get in arguments with them and say, ""Okay, tell me what you know. And by the way, you're wrong."" I listen to them and try to learn and I give them my points of view, but I don't try to get into arguments and tell them that they're wrong or they don't know what they're doing. I try to get as much information from them so that I can learn more. Maybe that's it. I have a way of asking people questions, as you do, that lets people talk. In other words, as you probably know, being a good interviewer means that you let the interviewee be the star of the show. Don't be the star of the show if you're the interviewer. Some people who have been interviewers try to dominate the questioning, and therefore they don't let the interviewee feel that he or she can really speak freely or for a long period of time. So you get more information if you let the interviewee talk, as you obviously do. Patrick: One of the things I've loved that you've done is start to cluster these interviews around specific topics. And maybe the one that seems the most relevant in the world today is about leadership. And what you did was... people should go read the book. It's awesome. I'm curious if there's audio versions of those interviews. I'd definitely love to consume them all, but I'd love you to describe the source of your interest in this topic, again, maybe back to its earliest days. And then I have several questions about what you learned through that exercise of talking to some of the world's best leaders in a variety of different and interesting categories that you carve them up into in the book. David: When you were in grade school, there was somebody that was probably the principal's or the teacher's favorite, or he or she was the best athlete or the best student. And you always say, ""Why is this person the leader?"" I'm always in the same situation. Why is this person the leader? What are their skillsets? How do they get this way? How do they become a leader? So I'm always looking up to people and saying, how did they become a leader when I was not so much of a leader? And gradually as people more and more began to see me more of a leader, I began to say as I got older, I wasn't such a great leader earlier. How come I became a leader now? And I have a tortoise and hare theory, that if you're really a hare and you're great in high school, you might peter out and you might say, ""I don't need to work so hard."" You take back to your grade school or your high school. I don't know whether you were first in your class or not. Patrick: I was a terrible student. David: Okay. So let's take whoever was first in your class, president of the student government and captain of the football team. What happened to those people? Well, I've often gone back and tried to find out these things, because surprisingly it's very rare to have somebody to be a great student leader, a great person in the middle part of their career, and then in the latter part of their career, they're still a great leader. That happens occasionally, but rarely. I've gone back ... in fact, in my high school, I went to large public high school and there were 1500 people in my class. And there was only one person who got into Harvard. He was student body president, all American, all state lacrosse player, good looking guy, everything you want. And then what happened to him? He went to Harvard and apparently he dropped out. He now is selling I think Tai Chi exercises for $125 an hour somewhere in upstate New York.But somebody who was nothing in high school, I was barely anything, I got luckier in life. So you never know what's going to happen. And I am interested in leadership because I'm interested in what makes people a leader. And why should we want to have leaders? Why not have everybody be a follower? Well, if there's seven and a half billion people, everybody was a follower and nobody was a leader, you wouldn't get as much done. So leaders are the ones in business, in politics, in engineering, in entrepreneurship who really make the world a better place, I think because they take people where they maybe want them to go. So I am interested in leadership. And on my audio books, what I do is this, I tape record my interviews. When we do an audio book, we actually use the actual voice of the person. Very often, audio books you have professional readers who read what was in the book. I don't do that. I have my voice and the interviewee's voice. So if you want to listen to the audio book, you can actually hear what the person said as they said it. Patrick: Amazing. Tell me the story of the time that you've been most personally in awe of a leader and something they were doing. David: When I was a little boy I always looked up to John Kennedy. He was president of the United States. I was in awe of him. When I went to work in the White House I was only 27 years old. And the president of the United States' office is not that far from mine. So I guess I was in awe of him. There are many people that I have met over the years who I've been extraordinarily impressed with. And when you meet people that are famous and you get to see them up close, you kind of say, ""Okay, they put their pants on one leg at a time,"" or something like that. And you realize everybody has their own story. Everybody is, with some exceptions, a reasonably likable person you can have a conversation with.So for example, this weekend, I did an interview for my TV show of somebody I'd never met before, really. I was always intrigued by him, Sylvester Stallone. Now here's a guy that started Rocky and he's Rambo, and great dialogue with him about all that stuff. So I'm always looking at interesting people that I can interview. And earlier this week, I also interviewed Lionel Richie, who I'd never had a chance to interview before. So I find it intellectually challenging to get ready to prepare to interview them because I have to read about them and get my mindset ready to do the interview. Patrick: Obviously, there's lots of different kinds of leaders. You boil it down to visionaries and builders and transformers and commanders. There's lots of these different, interesting categories. Curious how you came to those. Even those categories, do you think that there are any most basic, almost like the primary colors of leadership? Most basic ingredients in any leadership recipe? David: Number one, have a vision of what you want to do. In other words, you can't just sit around in your office, say, ""I don't really want to do anything."" And all of a sudden, you're going to be a leader. You have to say, ""I want to do something. Accomplish something. Have a vision."" Bill Gates had a vision. Steve Jobs had a vision. And so, whatever it is. Second, you got to persist. Because whatever you say you want to do, there'll be inevitable resistance to it. Because it was such a great idea, somebody would've done it already. So, you've got to persist because people are going to tell you no. And then, at some point in your career, as you're persisting, or maybe before you started this new idea, you have to fail. You have to learn what it means to be a failure. I've met a few people in life who are so charming and so good looking and so wonderful that they never failed at anything. And then, when they got later in life and they found a challenge, they didn't know how to deal with it. You have to learn how to fail. Failing earlier is better than failing later.You also have to know how to communicate with people. How do you actually persuade anybody to follow you? You have to be able to be an oral communicator. You don't have to be Martin Luther King, but you have to be able to speak in a very effective way, so you can get people to follow you. Or you have to be able to write in effective way. You don't have to be Thomas Jefferson, but you have to write in a way that people will read what you say and then will follow you. Or you lead by example. Those are important things. You've got to get followers and you know how to communicate with them. You have to share the credit. Obviously, there's some leaders that tell everybody how great they are, but they're not the leaders you want to admire. The ones that share the credit. Turns out, a lot of businessman superstars had partners when they started these companies. They didn't really do it by themselves. And sometimes they share the credit, sometimes they don't.And then also, I think great leaders are people that rise to the occasion. If you're in a business and your business is about to go bankrupt and you rise to the occasion and you survive it, make it turn around, that's great. Or, if you are in a war. We probably never would've heard of Abraham Lincoln if the Civil War hadn't arisen, or FDR would've been seen as a modestly competent person if World War II hadn't arisen. When occasion occurs, you rise. You take President Zelenskyy of Ukraine. He would've been seen as a comedian who happened to get elected by accident, as the president of Ukraine, had this war not come along. Now, he's going to go down. And certainly, in today's period of time, as one of the great heroic leaders of our age, because he stood up to the Russian machine. Patrick: I often get this question of who the best interviewers are. And one of the people that always comes to mind is Oprah, who's one of the people that you interviewed in the category of visionaries. What did you learn from her? David: Oprah, I have known a little bit because when I became the chairman of the Kennedy Center, we gave her a Kennedy Center honor that first year, and I kind of met her. And I remember the story my mother had told me. I'm from Baltimore. And when I went out to college, my mother would tell me that we have a great newscaster in Baltimore now, Oprah Winfrey. I said, ""Really?"" And she said, ""Yeah, and she's going to go somewhere. Nationwide. She's too big for Baltimore."" I said, ""No Baltimore newscaster's ever gone nationwide. So I don't think so."" Later, I told Oprah that story when she got the Kennedy Center honors. Oprah said to me, when I interviewed her, ""Look, I'm not a great interviewer."" She said about herself, ""But I'm a good listener. A really good listener."" And she's right. To be a good interviewer, you have to listen to what the person says and then play off of it.When the FBI comes by and does a background interview of me for somebody else, maybe you've had this. Somebody wants a background check. The FBI will typically have a checklist of 12 questions. You could say in response to question number three, ""The person's actually an ax murderer, and I know where they bury the bodies."" They'll just go to question number four. They don't listen to what you say. They just go to the next thing. They get their checklist done. So, you have to listen and then play off of what the person's saying, and that makes the interview more effective. Patrick: Is that your method, too? Have you borrowed that in your style? David: My style is this. Here's what I do. It's not a secret. Everybody has their own style. You have yours, I have mine. What I do is I do as much research as I can. And then, I put it in my brain and I sit down and I type up what I would like to have as the questions. Introductory things to have grand, over-spanning-arching questions, then go through the trajectory of the person's life, and then have some overall larger questions. And then I send the question to the person. When I do that, they're asking me sometimes, but I like to do it because I want to make sure they realize I'm not trying to embarrass them. I'm not 60 Minutes in the old days, and trying to embarrass people. I'm just trying to have a nice, light, reasonably intelligent conversation. When I have the conversation, I don't use those notes. I memorize them because I wrote them. So, I know about 80, 90% of it. And then I start with the interviews, and then I listen to the people. And then, as they depart from what I think they're going to say, or they say something I think they're going to say, but I think there might be a humorous moment, I try to intersperse humor.And one of my techniques you may have observe is I like to use humor a bit because I think humor relaxes people. It makes audiences feel better. So, I'm not a Mike Wallace, not a 60 Minutes kind of person. I never try to embarrass anybody. I never try to do anything other than make them feel good. And the people that I interview generally feel good about it, and so, that's my style. Now, you can criticize me by saying, ""You shouldn't give the questions in advance. A serious journalist wouldn't do that."" I'm not a serious journalist. You should ask tougher questions and be meaner to these people. Okay. People can do that. That's just not my style. I do what I'm comfortable with and people seem to like it.",3507
172,"David Rubenstein - Life, Leadership, and LBOs","Leadership, Success, and Branding at Carlyle"," Patrick: And what was your leadership style when you were running Carlyle for all those years? Given that you've studied leaders so much, where do you slot in? David: Well, I tried to focus on what I knew best. I mean, the way I built Carlyle, I didn't really have the investment skills as a background. I didn't go to business school. I was a lawyer. So, I brought in people actually knew what they were doing about investing. And so, I let them take care of that. And I decided to figure out what was my comparative advantage. And it was that I was willing to go on the road and raise money and ask people for money, which you have to do if you're going to be in the investment business. I was willing to go recruit people. I was pretty good at convincing people to join us. And I came up with a strategy of building out a global firm and the way we did it. So I was really focused on what I knew how to do better. And then I deferred to my partners in their area. So, I would rarely say, ""This deal you guys want to do, it's terrible. I'm against it. I'm going to block it."" I didn't usually do that. I would give them my questions and my concerns, but I wouldn't try to block it, just so they wouldn't try to block what I was trying to do, and it kind of worked out. Patrick: I've always been fascinated, the stories of the big investment institutions and how they're built. If you imagine a definitive, incredibly accurate book written about Carlyle's whole history up through the present, to what do you think that author would attribute Carlyle's success most? What were the key variables that drove what's obviously been a phenomenal outcome for the business overall? David: We were based in Washington, DC, and by being based in Washington, we were out of the gunfire of people in New York who would've said, ""You don't have investment banking background. You're not qualified."" Secondly, by being based in Washington, I could recruit people who wanted to stay in Washington or be connected to somebody in Washington. So, Jim Bakker, Frank Carlucci, George Herber, Walker Bush, Dick Darman, Arthur Levit. There were people that were in Washington or connected to Washington, so I had an advantage and I could get people that people in New York might not have otherwise hired or thought of hiring. Third, I came up with an idea, was kind of my idea, that sort of worked, which is to say this. When private equity firms started, they were mom and pop firms. You had one fund and they had a small amount of people, and they might have a fair amount of money, but not that many people. KKR did the RJRD on 1989. They only had seven or eight investment professionals. And that was the biggest buy out of at that time at about $24 billion.I decided what I would do is I'd have a buyout fund, but after I had that, I would go raise a capital fund, a venture fund, a real estate fund, a debt fund and have multiple funds, and then take advantage of that by building up my back office, so I would centralize the administrative and use it for all the various funds, and then get people to buy into the brand name of Carlyle. And then, if they were happy with fund one, they would go into fund two and fund three and so forth, and different areas. And then, I decided to globalize it by doing something that had not been done before. Go to Europe, go to Asia, go to Japan, Middle East, and build teams in these places, so we would have a global thing.And then, of course, the track record was good. My partners were responsible for investing the money more than I was, and so the track record was good. And so, that was a combination of it. But also willingness to work hard, and then not trying to enemies. And we always put our investors first. Jeff Bezos is famous for saying, ""Put your customers first. That's always the most important thing."" And we, in effect, did that. We always would put the investors first. If we made a mistake, we tried to make it up to the investors. In the early days, we could basically say, ""Well, we'll make you whole somehow."" Or do something that would make up for a mistake we might have made. Patrick: Is it true that you almost ended up with a major stake in Amazon, in its early days? David: We did. What happened was Baker & Taylor was a company we own, which is the second largest book distributor in the United States. Not a very profitable company, never had been. But it was a break even. And apparently, Jeff Bezos went to Baker & Taylor and asked if he could rent their bibliography of books in print, because he was going to sell books over the internet. And I didn't really hear about it at the beginning, but our guy later told me that he offered, I think it was 20% of the company, in return for using the bibliography.And our guy said, ""No, we want cash."" And we ultimately agreed to $100,000 a year for five years."" And so, when I heard about all this, about two years into Amazon's existence, I flew out to meet Jeff and said, ""Look, I think we would take some startup capital now, because you're going to do well, and I think we now made a mistake. So, can we get our 20%?"" And he said, ""Well, I don't really need you so much anymore because our company's now two years old, but I'll give you 1% of the company in return for tearing up the deal we have. Thank you for we helping me to get off the ground."" So, we took that 1% and we ultimately sold it at the IPO. It was stupid, but we did. Patrick: Fascinating. If you think about Carlyle's brand, which obviously is a key sterling part of the story in the way you described institution building around the world, what ways were effective in terms of the investment made in the brand itself? I think even today, if you ask people to brand associate or something, they'd say the things you want them to, and I know that's hard to do. So, how did you do that? David: Branding Carlyle, we were obviously well known for being in Washington. So, therefore, people thought we understood government better than people elsewhere. And so, very often, when I was meeting investors, I would explain to them what's going on in Washington. People are fascinated all over the world about what is going on in Washington, DC. So, I would often talk about that, and I could talk about president's policies or politics reasonably well. So, people were interested in that.People also thought our brand was that we were not at the cutting edge of doing the most exotic things, but we were pretty cautious and careful. And we had a pretty respectable track record, and that we basically were people that didn't have our egos out of control. We didn't come from Wall Street. We weren't really focused on fees that much. We're focused on good investment returns, and the combination of all these things, plus working very hard to develop investor relationships all over the world, paid dividends at some point. Patrick: I think it was Bill Janeway that first got me so interested in the relationship between government and business. In his case, most specifically in the world of venture capital. But I'd love to hear your take on that. I think we often mistakenly think of business and government as separate things, but obviously they're inextricably intertwined. How should a new or up and coming investor think about this relationship between government and business? David: Look, the truth is, many of the great fortunes are made because people observe that government has developed a policy, had a policy or has a new policy that will encourage one industry versus another industry. And so, people take advantage of it. Don't think of almost any company. They're probably going to take advantage of something the government has done to make it possible for them to do what they've done. That government has incentives in one type or another, or it does certain things that are politically popular and you might want to advantage of it. So, government has a gigantic impact on what you do in the business world. And I think it was a mistake for some of the technology companies to ignore Washington early on. Now, they are spending a lot of time here because they realize government can really affect their business. And maybe for the better.Take Amazon as an example. Amazon's biggest profits really are not from selling books over the internet or anything over the internet. It's from AWS. That's where the biggest margins are. People recognize they were a leader in this when the CIA gave them a contract years ago. People said, ""Wait a second. The CIA is giving a contract for cloud work to Amazon? What is Amazon doing in this business?"" And people hadn't realized it. And then people began to dig into it and realized it's good enough for the CIA, it's good enough for me. And so, the Amazon business at AWS grew to be the biggest in the world. Patrick: How have you seen businesses best interact with government? Is it through lobbying and traditional means like that? And maybe it's just idiosyncratic to every company and its needs, but are there common traits of businesses that understand and interact with government best? David: Well, it depends on different businesses, but I think it's very effective. The lobbyists have some impact for sure because they know the members and all that, but nothing beats having employees or workers come into Washington and talk to members of Congress because these are the workers in their districts. Other states. Or having a more senior level, having a CEO come in and meet with the president of the United States, and having the CEO really know what he or she's talking about. It's very effective. And that's why a lot of CEOs spend a lot of time in Washington these days, because government policy can really make or break them in many ways. So, what major government policy today is not going to affect business in one significant way or another?",2293
173,"David Rubenstein - Life, Leadership, and LBOs",What the Best Business Builders Do Well," Patrick: I noticed that, in the book on leadership, under the category of builders, there were actually some investment leaders, Robert Smith, Ken Griffin, maybe even more than that. Phil Knight was in that category, obviously, as a traditional builder. What did you learn in that leadership in the style of builders that you think is most portable for other people out there? David: Sometimes people might be an innovative genius and they come up with a brilliant idea, and they may not be a great administrator, a good operator, but the idea itself ultimately takes on and they had other people help them. Sometimes you get people that might not have thought of something for the first time, but they really built it in a way that's better than anybody else did. Let me give you an example on the ones you just mentioned. I just interviewed Ken Griffin recently. And as you know, he's built two successful companies. One is a hedge fund, but another one is his market maker, Citadel Securities. And there are other market makers out there, but they built a company that is just incredibly in the market making business. And he just sold a piece of it, 21 or 22 billion valuation to Sequoia and Paradigm. He's a builder. He built something. Wasn't the first person that met idea of being a market maker, but he built something in that area that was quite impressive and is quite impressive. Patrick: Is the common trait there just people that are more nose to the grindstone, know what's going on in the operation side of things? Is there something different than the Jeff Bezos? Maybe Bezos is a bad example because he seems to be good at everything. David: My experience is that most people, there may be a few people who have wonderful ideas, but their head is in the sky and they don't really get down into brass tacks and build the company. The people that are successful entrepreneurs, building companies, you can call them builders or visionaries, are really into the details. Steve Jobs was into every detail, as we know. Bill Gates was into every detail. And Ken Griffin and others, people that build great companies, actually, they master the details. And it's not just having a vision of something and let somebody else do it. That can happen occasionally, but that rarely is the case. Patrick: The last category I was really interested in this idea of leadership is, I think you called it masters. I was interested because it was an atypical category relative to some builder of a big institution. So, examples were like Yoyo Ma, a performer, Coach K, who just retired, Jack Nicholas, single player in a sport. What was your interest in this category of what you called masters? And what did you learn from them? David: Masters are people who, they didn't invent golf or they didn't invent basketball, but they perfected it in a way that almost nobody else did. How did they become a leader? How do you perfect the skill of being a basketball coach or being a great golfer? And there's no one skill that anybody can say is the way to do it. But practice, practice, practice makes a big difference. And then learning how to communicate with other people very often, like Coach K. You have to communicate with young teenagers if you're going to be a great coach in the college world. And Yoyo Ma, it's just practice. I mean, he's very talented, for sure, but practice, practice, practice. So, to become a great master at something, you have to just give up other parts of your life and really practice it, and perfect that skill over and over and over again. Patrick: If you go back to your job as the leader and builder of Carlyle specifically, I've got a few areas of interest, just because, again, I'm so interested in money management and institution building. The first is around talent. Obviously, it's a very people heavy business, those with the best talent, investing talent, client talent, et cetera, tend to win. What did you learn about being able to fairly compensate and retain the highest caliber people, given that often they have options to go start their own firm or whatever? David: One of the advantages we had in the beginning at Carlyle was we were based in Washington. There weren't a lot of other firms like ours that could steal people away if people wanted to stay in Washington. We obviously built that other office and then now have more people, probably professional investors, in New York than we have in Washington. I would say that everybody wants to feel that they're part of a healthy culture. Everybody wants to enjoy where they work. If you build a culture where people think that you care very much about them, you compensate them fairly, but you tell them that maybe you can make money elsewhere even more than you're making with me, but you feel like you're part of something, you enjoy going to work, you enjoy your colleagues, that can make a big difference. So, in building our firm, we really wanted to make sure that there was a culture, a friendliness culture, where people felt that working together was helpful. And in the end, if they worked together, they would make a really good compensation out of it and then be fairly rewarded. Patrick: And in terms of giving your focus on opening these office, building the relationships with investors, raising money, et cetera, what defines great there? So, there's lots of people that try to do that function. What do you think is special about how you did it in terms of building relationships with LP investors? David: Well, when you're meeting with investors and you have investors, you have to be honest. If you make mistakes, explain it. Tell people upfront what went wrong and be honest about it. If you do a good job, don't brag about it so much and tell people how wonderful you are. People will read the material and they'll figure out you've done well, if you've actually done well. But also making people feel like they're part of a club. They're part of an organization where you really care about them, not just their money. And I think that's very helpful. I think making investors feel that they're more than just a number and more than just a client and building an organization around the world. When you're recruiting people, you want to make them also feel like they're part of something different and something that's going to be enjoyable to be part of. And that they're not going to be embarrassed by being involved with it. Patrick: I think people would be amazed at doing some Googling at the prolific nature with which you've attacked, I'll call it the media, part of your life. Books. Another book, I think, maybe your four or fifth coming out in the fall, called How To Invest, How To Lead, we talked about. We'll talk about the American stuff later on. You've done an incredible amount of media. What have you learned there? What has surprised you about your foray into media, in terms of what works? What do you wish had worked better? I'm just curious to hear your lessons, given you have been prolific in the last 10, 15 years. David: I'm not Mr. Handsome. I'm not Mr. Charming. I don't have all the attributes of a wonderful television host or something. So, I wasn't sure that I could pull off all of this and I'm not writing books that Darwin would've written or something like that. I mean, these are nice books, but they're not going to win Nobel prizes for literature or anything like that. But they're easy to read and I think enjoyable. So I basically learned that try to focus on what you're working on at the time. Try to make something really good. Don't try to do something that's half-assed. Make it really, really good. And then people will maybe respond to it and then learn along the way. I'm better today at talking with you this way than I was five years ago or 10 years ago, just as you're probably better at doing this podcast than you were when you first started. You learn.In terms of media, I would say I'm still in the stone age because while I do have some of the things you mentioned, I don't know how to do Instagram. I'm not that good at that stuff. I should learn how to do it. And it's clear to me that I meet people sometimes and they tell me, ""Well, I have 20 million followers on Instagram."" I think I might have two followers on Instagram if I started. The reason I don't do some of that stuff is I'm embarrassed to how few followers I would have. Patrick: I'm fascinated that you went the direction for your next book of ""How to Invest"". I mean, it seems to be something probably you didn't need a ton of training on, and yet you went to the trouble of going to meet people. How did you approach that? When you're building that project, how did you decide kind of the categories you created for leadership? Did you do the same thing here, where you created categories of investing? What were you hoping to get out of this exercise? David: Because I'm in the investment world, I know a lot of people. So it wasn't that difficult to get these people to let me interview them. That's always a trick, as you know. Get people to let you get into their lives. Secondly, I put it in the three categories. You can have an infinite number of categories. Basically I said, I had what I'll call mainstream. So people that do traditional stocks and bonds and things like that, real estate. Then I have alternatives, which is private equity, venture capital, hedge funds and so forth. And then I have something I call new, which is something that's relatively even newer than private equity. And that's things like cryptocurrency, SPACs, things like that that are relatively new infrastructure. And the hardest part is this. I interviewed a lot of people, but the publisher doesn't have enough space for all the interviews. So now I have to go to some people and say, ""Well-"" Patrick: Sorry. David: ... ""You didn't make the book. But you're really good and I'm going to use this somewhere else."" Or ""I'm going to put you in the audio version of it."" Or ""My publisher's the bad person. I wanted you in, but the publisher didn't."" It's not easy. Patrick: I know your pain there. With that experience, do you think you would be good at picking money managers? If your whole job was to be a fund to funds or something, do you think you'd be good at it? David: Well, I do that in effect now while I have people help me. I've set up a family office. Patrick: Declaration it's called, right? David: Declaration. We have a part of it that does invest in funds and things like that. And I have people working on it, of course. But I do have a reasonably good intuition of things, but I'm not perfect. I make a lot of mistakes. And so I would say I'm okay. But I tend to rely a little bit more on my gut than on enormous amounts of due diligence. So people working in declaration, they spend much more time on due diligence than I would have the patience to do. But the truth is if you're putting money out with people, the best people are going to be people that probably don't have the longest track record. Because the best people starting new funds are going to be people that are building the next Blackstone or Carlyle or Apollo. And they're young and they're hungry and they're ambitious to prove themselves. If you go into somebody's fund who's been there doing it for 20 years, it may or may not be as good. Patrick: If intuition, and I totally understand the notion there, is key when evaluating somebody, what do you think the intuition's onto? What about them do you think excites you most commonly across the people that you backed or partnered with? David: Looking for people that are reasonably intelligent. Geniuses are tough to back because sometimes they get a little crazy. But reasonably intelligent, hardworking, have a vision of what they want to do. This is their life. They're putting up whatever they have in money in terms of alongside you. They are available to answer questions. They can explain what they're doing. If somebody can't explain what they're doing to me, I get nervous. If you really can't explain it, I wonder whether they really understand or whether it's going to be something I'm going to understand when they make a mistake what they really did wrong. Those are some of the things. I also like people that have reasonable educational backgrounds. So I recognize not everybody goes to the famous schools and I like people that are I think focused on the business at the time. Later in life, they can focus on philanthropy. They can focus on all kinds of other personal things. But I'm looking for somebody that's really focused and in their twenties or thirties on building this business. You get all those qualities together and generally you get a good idea. Patrick: What goes wrong with geniuses? Why that hesitation? That's interesting. David: Geniuses are very, very hard to manage for one thing. I've hired a few people that some people might say are geniuses, but they usually didn't work out. That's not always the case. But geniuses are coddled for a bit by people telling them their whole life how brilliant they are. And when people tell you how brilliant you are, you believe so much in your ideas that you are maybe not going to listen to other people. You're going to be tone deaf about certain things. Now, some people you would say are Steve Jobs was a genius you could argue. Or you could argue Bill Gates was. And they worked out. But for every Steve Jobs and Bill Gates, there are plenty of people you don't hear of who just were brilliant but they didn't get anywhere.",3185
174,"David Rubenstein - Life, Leadership, and LBOs","America's Past, Present and Future"," Patrick: The other key theme through all your work is this interest in American history. You did the same thing you did with leaders and you're doing with investing with historians in a book called The American Story. That's really, really interesting. And The American Experiment being another work on this same topic. What are the key big, interesting aspects to you here about American history? Why have you spent so much time learning about... Obviously, you're in Washington. You have the sort of geography in your favor yet again. But what is it about our history as a country that has you so incredibly interested? David: I worked in the White House as a young man. So when you work in the White House as a young man, you do get a sense of history. You work the same place as a lot of famous people. Secondly, I've stayed in Washington. Therefore, you see all them monuments and memorials and so forth from time to time. The book you referred to, the first one, I basically started a program to educate members of Congress about American history where I interview a great historian in front of members of Congress once a month. I did that for about five years. Because of COVID we stopped. But we're starting again tomorrow night. I'm going to interview Susan Eisenhower who wrote a book about her grandfather, President Eisenhower. And I think it's an interesting thing to kind of educate other people about American history. So it's something I'm interested in. And I tell people to find things you're interested in and pursue them. If you told me I had to educate people about nuclear physics, I don't think I could do that very well because I don't understand it. Patrick: If you think about the key drivers of American outcomes, what are they in your mind? Is it the original Bill of Rights? Is it property and rule of law? What have been the key ingredients that have allowed the experiment to sustain? David: This country succeeded in part because we have a constitution that's worked reasonably well. Only 27 amendments in 250 years, which is pretty good. It's got lots of flaws. Slavery was the biggest flaw and not having the right for women to vote was another major flaw. But it's working reasonably well with the amendments. Secondly, the capitalist system took hold in this country. It's an improvement on the capitalist system that operated in Western Europe when we started our country. And we've refined it. And entrepreneurial activity is another part of culture. And that's really one of the things that made this country I think work pretty well.Having a two party system has worked pretty well keeping the government I think more stable than it would've been in a multi-party kind of system. The immigration has been an important thing because we get fresh people that are ambitious and hardworking and so forth. They come here believing in the American dream and they try to execute it. Those have been some of the most important things we've had in our country. And also, there's certain freedoms that we have in the Bill of Rights that'll let people say what they want to say or worship the way they want to worship. These are kind of things that have been part of our culture. I call them our genes, but that's really part of our culture. Patrick: What do you think are the biggest areas of potential improvement for America in those same system settings today? David: The principle flaws we have today are income inequality is getting worse, not getting better. And lack of social mobility is getting worse, not better. I grew up in a modest blue collar background, but I believe in the American dream. I was white, I didn't have the prejudice against me. I was Jewish, but the prejudice wasn't as apparent as if you were black. I worked hard, as you no doubt did and worked your way up. I think today, many people don't believe in the American dream. Immigrants believe in it more than people who are born in this country in many cases. If I had the answer to income inequality and lack of social mobility, I would've been in Iowa and New Hampshire many times trying to run for president. I don't have the answers, no easy answer. But one answer that I think is something we should focus on, literacy.Right now, 14% of Americans cannot read past the fourth grade level. If you're functioning illiterate, which is what that definition means, if you can't read past the fourth grade level, you have no chance of succeeding in our country or in any country. We let the 1.7 million people drop out of high school every year. We don't really I think train people to read as well as we should. 80% of the people in the juvenile delinquency system are functioning illiterate. So until you solve literacy, you have no chance as a person in the social underclass of rising up in my view. That's a big problem. Patrick: What lessons did you learn navigating that mobility yourself? So you went from very humble beginnings to obviously incredible personal wealth and tons of philanthropy, we'll talk about that in a minute. A lot of people burn up through that process or have it go very badly. Seems like yours has gone quite well. What lessons did you learn about navigating that? Or maybe I have it wrong. David: I try to maintain some humility. Trying to recognize that I wasn't gifted in many areas so I had to work harder than other people. Trying to learn from people that could be mentors or could educate me. Trying to make as many contacts as I could, because you never know who might call you up with some good idea someday or help you with a job. Many of the jobs I got, I got because I had some random contact I didn't think would lead to anything, but it ultimately did. Ultimately, I think for anybody listening to this who wants to kind of rise up, I think trying to read as much as you can, learning how to perfect your oral skills, learning how to write reasonably well is very important. Learning how to network with people, retaining some humility, sharing the credit. These are the things that I thought I did along the way and I got lucky too. Patrick: How did you teach your kids about this topic? David: The hardest thing in the world to do is raise children. Even harder than raising children is raising children if you're wealthy or famous, because we've all seen examples where that didn't result in such wonderful offspring. I tried to be a role model a bit by doing things that I think they would be proud of and try to not spoil them by giving them undue money but make sure they have a good education. As of this moment, I've never told my children, ""I'm giving you X dollars when I die."" Or they're going to get a large amount of money before I die. I help them a bit around the way along the way and help them with their education. But none of them are sitting back and just saying, ""Well, I can't wait until my father dies. I'm going to inherit a billion dollars."" All of my kids are well-educated and they all have MBAs. And they're all in mankind's highest calling, private equity. Patrick: The extent to which you've seen it go wrong with friends or colleagues or acquaintances or whatever with their kids, what are the reasons that can go wrong? David: I'm not citing myself as a perfect parent. I'm not. One is not putting enough time into it, making your kids think that there's a higher priority than them. Not listening to them when they have a problem. Not trying to nurture them in things that need nurturing. Giving them too much when they don't really earn it. Patrick: All your kids are in God's highest calling, private equity. What do you think of the state of that industry today? What is its best and highest function? What do you think attracted them to it? Obviously your background, but... David: Private equity. And when I use the term private equity, I mean the American sense of private investments and so forth. So one's doing venture, one's and growth capital and so forth. I think that they all got MBAs from really good schools. Maybe they saw me as a bit of a role model. I don't know. Maybe I should have nurtured their creative skills and had them be artists or poets or playwrights. It just didn't work that way. I'm not sure why they drifted into it, but they did. And maybe I encouraged them somewhat, but I didn't force them to go into that business for sure. Patrick: And what do you think about, abstracted away from them, just the state of things today? Do you think we're in a good time for this kind of investing? A bad time? Obviously, the prices have been extraordinarily high in the last two or three years. What do you think? David: For the last 40 years, people have said, ""Look, private equity's about to fall apart. Private equity can't keep doing what it's doing"" and for the last 40 years and every year in the last 40 years, private equity has outperformed everything else because in the end, economic incentives are staggering. 20% of the profits, if not 30% of the profits. And the ability to fix companies. If you make a mistake, sometimes you're in a private setting. You have the opportunity to fix it before the public realizes the mistake that you might have made. You tend to attract a lot of very talented people too. There's no doubt the economic reward system is very good and so you attract a lot of talented people, hardworking people. Private equity returns may come down because there's so much money in it now. But the basic ingredients of private equity, which is the economic incentives system, fixing things, being more aligned with the workers and the managers, I think that does tend to produce pretty good rates of return. And we'll probably be here for quite some time. Patrick: What's been your experience in this new category, maybe crypto's the right place to start since it's the obvious one to ask about, as you viewed new versions of this same thing, where those same economic incentives to exist in the new category. Certainly, in crypto they do. Often, it's 30% not 20% of the upside. What have you learned and what is your impression of that strange new world? David: Well, I was skeptical of crypto in the beginning because I figured there's nothing underlying this. But it's clear to me now that many younger people don't think that there's much underlying the dollar or the euro or other currencies so they think, I really can't get gold for my dollar anymore. So maybe the government's promise to make it valuable isn't maybe there when you have so much money you're borrowing and you're inflating your way out of the value of the currency. So I think many people like the fact that it's private. You can't really know how much somebody owns. They like to be able to transfer around the world.And look, if you're in Ukraine or you're in Russia and you want to have some assets and your country has got lots of challenges, having some cryptocurrency probably enables you to feel better that you can have something that's outside of the government's control and it's not dependent on the bank opening up its doors to you. Another factor, seen people make money in this and therefore they tend to go where people have made money. I have not bought cryptocurrencies, but I have bought companies that service the industry because I think the genie is out of the bottle and I don't think the industry's going to go away anytime soon.",2600
175,"David Rubenstein - Life, Leadership, and LBOs",Why Giving Back is So Important," Patrick: It seems like another thing in common across all of your career has been very often being the chair of different kinds of institutions, whether those are arts or political or business or what have you. Are you always drawn to that role and you've gotten better at it over time, what makes for a good chairman or chairwoman? David: I'm not quite sure. I usually get a lot of boards and eventually I wind up as a chair. Maybe it's because the other people aren't smart enough to know that being a chair takes a lot of time and they don't want the job. So I don't know. But maybe I got it because I was the only person not in the room when they were voting on the chair. I don't know. When I get involved in a nonprofit, I try to make a difference. So if I say, look, I'm going to be the chairman of the county center there. I said, I want to build a new building there. I'm going to make a difference, try to make something happen. So I don't want to be a chair just to preside. I want to do something that makes the organization better for my having been the chair. And obviously, sometimes that takes leadership. Sometimes it takes money. I do enjoy it and I actually enjoy running meetings. And I think I have a good sense of humor so I can make the meetings go less painful than non-profit board meetings might otherwise be. Patrick: How do you run a good meeting? This seems like a skill under discussed and very worthy skill. David: Call on people to ask their views. Try to make sure you have people going to present, who have some interesting things to say. But listen to what people have to say and then try to have some good things to talk about each time. And also, end on time. Patrick: Good one. What is the most interesting system I'll call it, political or otherwise, outside of the US that you've spent time in and observed? David: Singapore is an incredible country. It's very small, maybe 5 million natives and maybe 2 million expats or something like that. Works extremely well. It's very honest. No corruption that I'm aware of. And it's a really intellectual center. I think it's pretty good. I think Israel has a government that you could say is very Noah's Ark like. It just has so many different parties in it. It doesn't kind of work as well as I think our system works. But Israel has an incredible entrepreneurial culture in the country and quite impressive in my view. I'm impressed with number of other countries that have had to survive in very difficult situations.Clearly, Ukraine is now a poster child on how to survive bombardment. I assume they'll emerge from this stronger than they otherwise would've been. Though obviously, I wish they hadn't gone through this tragedy. But there are a lot of nonprofit organizations that I think have done a really good job of managing problems. I'm a member of the board of the World Economic Forum, which is the Davos Group. And I think they've done a wonderful job as well trying to bring people together from all over the world and try to listen to them and have some good solutions come to enormous problems. Patrick: Did you ever meet Lee Kuan Yew in Singapore? David: Oh, yes. Patrick: What was your impression of him? David: Well, many people would say who knew him better than I did. I know his son, who's the prime minister now, much better. Lee Kuan Yew I met through President Bush and some others when I was there. A brilliant man who many people would've thought would've been one of the most powerful people in the world had a country that was big as China or United States. Very smart, very brilliant. A great leader, built a country from nothing. I mean, he took over that country in the early '60s and built it into an incredible thing. And Malaysia didn't want Singapore. They kind of gave it away. And all of a sudden, he's built this great powerhouse. Patrick: Obviously, it's part of you giving back. You've given money to tons of different academic institutions, nonprofit institutions, et cetera. You're giving pledge signer. What have you learned about doing that well? I mean, it seems like you've really spread it around. Not just a one cause giver or anything like this. What precipitates you giving a major gift? What are the conditions? David: I have four standards for my philanthropy. Number one, start something that wouldn't otherwise get started. So building the Kennedy Center, they wouldn't have done if I didn't want to do it. Or fixing Monticello. It wouldn't have gotten done if I didn't want to really put up the money to do it. Or building at the University of Chicago that I just built and it's now open for the university conference center. So I try to start something that wouldn't otherwise get started. I try to finish something that otherwise wouldn't get finished. Third, I try to find something I'm going to have an intellectual interest in so that I'm willing to be involved not just by writing a check, but being involved on the board or other ways.In other words, it's my view that philanthropy is derived from an ancient Greek word that means loving humanity. And it doesn't mean just rich people writing checks and the thing that's the most valuable is your time. You can always make more money. You can't make more time. I want something I'm going to put time into. And the last standard is I want to see some progress during my lifetime. Now, that's a selfish thing and I should maybe give more money to global climate change things. But I don't think I have enough money to have an impact. I don't think I'm going to see enough progress in my lifetime and enough other people working on it. I'm trying to find things that there aren't as many other people doing as I'm interested in doing. Patrick: There's two physical things, literally physical as in atoms, Monticello and the Magna Carta, which you bought and I think lent to the National Archives. When is the physical interesting to you? What is it about physical artifacts or things with meaning that peaks your interests? David: Put it this way, I buy a lot of historic documents and I put them all on display. I just bought a rare copy of the Bill of Rights, and it'll also be going on display at the Natural Archives. The reason I do that is because I'm trying to remind people the history and heritage of our country. When people go to see the original of the Magna Carta, they're more likely, before they go, while they're there, or afterwards, to read about it and learn more about it. If you just look on a computer slide, you can find out what the words are in the Magna Carta, but I think when you actually see something in person, it makes a difference.The human brain may evolve in the next thousand years, or maybe even a hundred years, so if you look at something on a computer slide, it has the same impact as seeing it in person. We're not there yet. That's why I think it's important to preserve these things. Secondly, same with Monticello, preserve certain historic buildings for the same reason. People in this country don't really know much about the history and heritage of our country. We don't teach history in civics as much as we used to, so one small part of what I'm trying to do is remind people history and heritage of our country as a way of saying, ""Look, we don't want to make the mistakes of the past. Let's realize what we did wrong before, and let's try to fix it."" That's what civilization's all about, progressing and fixing the mistakes we made in the past and progressing forward in the Darwinian way. Patrick: What is the legacy of the Magna Carta? Why is that an interesting document to you? David: Well, the Magna Carta was a document that was the inspiration for the Declaration of Independence. It had more impact in many ways in this country than it did in England, more or less the first document of its type, which basically guaranteed certain rights. Now, the rights were guaranteed to barons, not the average people, certain people were excluded from the benefits of it, for sure, and it has lots of flaws in it. It's a symbol of people being able to get certain basic rights like the right to trial by jury, or a right to have a punishment proportionate to the crime, or the right to be represented when you're being taxed and so forth. It's a symbolic beginning to the idea that people really are more important than the rulers. Patrick: Just this weekend I read Teddy Roosevelt's speech, Citizenship in a Republic. It's where the man in the arena concept that he's famous for comes from. The longer speech is actually arguably even better. One of the things as I was reading it that I thought was I cannot imagine a modern day American politician giving a speech like this, and that bummed me out. I'm wondering if you agree with that. Maybe you could argue some of Obama's speeches were on that level or something. Why do you think that is? It just seems so much more connected and specific and intense and opinionated than we see today. David: The most effective speeches like Teddy Roosevelt's are speeches which do not promise to do anything. They are not speeches which list legislation. They are not ones that have the word I. Let me take three famous speeches. The Kennedy Inaugural Address, the Martin Luther King I Have a Dream speech, and the Gettysburg Address. In those speeches they basically don't use the word I virtually at all. They all end with the use of the phrase, God, at the end. They don't say, ""I'm going to pass this bill. I'm going to take this step."" It's all about theoretical things, and it tries to inspire people to be better about themselves. That's what the Teddy Roosevelt speech is about is getting people to be in the arena, trying to do something useful. I think great speeches are ones that have a theme to them. They're not too long. The Gettysburg Address is 272 words. If you read inspirational speeches, you'll find many things in common, but generally they don't brag about how great the speech maker is. Patrick: Do you agree that the nature of that has changed in politics? Are you unimpressed as I am with the current landscape? David: Today, you get people who have to spend 40% of their time raising money. When you have to raise that much money, you don't have time to give in the arena kind of speeches. Very few people write their own speeches. Barack Obama was a pretty good writer, and he did write a lot of his speeches, but when you're President you can't spend your time writing speeches full time. In those days with Teddy Roosevelt or others, people didn't have speech writers so much, and they actually could spend the time to write things. They didn't have to be interrupted by tweets all the time or responding to emails all the time. You did see that. I would say it's harder today to get people to write their own speeches that are going to be meaningful.",2581
176,"David Rubenstein - Life, Leadership, and LBOs","On Writing, Career, and Family"," Patrick: If you had to write yet another book after How to Invest comes out, maybe even entitled How To, what would it be? What's the next thing that has your interest? David: I've thought about writing a book on how to be an interviewer because the interview of business itself is an interesting phenomenon. We don't have interviews of Thomas Jefferson. There's no interviews of Abraham Lincoln, George Washington. Why is that? Because the interview format, as we now know it, came about as a form of entertainment education in the 1950s on The Tonight Show, and then other spinoffs on daytime talk shows and so forth. I've thought about doing a book where I would interview people that are no longer alive and get people who are experts in them to play that role. Like asking William Shakespeare, ""Tell us the truth. Who really wrote those plays? You couldn't have did it all by yourself."" Or asking Henry XIII, ""Why don't you just get a prenup and not have to chop the heads off of your wives?"" Or ask Cleopatra, ""Who's really a better lover, Mark Antony or Julius Caesar?"" I thought about doing that, but I don't know if I'll do that. Anyway. I think the interview format is a relatively novel concept in the grand span of history. Patrick: If you had to do it in the same format as the investing or leadership book and interviewers that are active today, who pops to mind? Maybe not learn the most from in the sense of emulation, but just respected the most? David: I think Oprah's a good interviewer. Mike Wallace was a good interviewer, too, different style. Chris Wallace is a good interviewer. He's now passed away. When Tim was on Meet the Press, I think he was a great interviewer. There are a number of other good interviewers. The trick in being a good interviewer on TV today is you've got to press somebody but not offend them, and it's sometimes hard to do because you're on timeframes and so forth. My next book I'm thinking about is probably going to be something like giving back to America, what it means to give back to America, and give examples of people who have given back to America. Then talk to people who had relatives who have given what Lincoln called the last full measure of devotion, obviously giving their life, or talk about people who have been wounded, lost two limbs or three limbs in a war.It's an interesting phenomenon. When you were growing up, you might have heard this, I know when I was growing up I heard it, that my country's the greatest country in the world and I'm prepared to give my life for it. Now when you think about it is anybody prepared to give their life for their neighborhood, for their little league team, for their state, for their school. People don't say that, but people often say I'm prepared to give my life for my country. Why is that? It's an interesting phenomenon that so many people are willing to give their lives to protect the way that we have our life in this country. It's something I'm interested about. I put it in one of my most recent books. I interviewed somebody who was prepared to give his life in Vietnam and almost did, and he won the Congressional Medal of Honor for it. Patrick: What do you think it is? What is the line between, maybe you'll choose, like I'm not going to give my life for Connecticut, but when it comes to the US, it changes somehow. What is it? David: I think there's a sense that your country is your way of life. You're protecting your children and it's just a different phenomenon. For example, if I said to you today, somebody said to me, ""Look, you have a chance to go to Ukraine and fight for the US army if we're going to go there."" Let's suppose the US army goes into Ukraine, and you're going to go there, and you're going to fight for your country in Ukraine, or we're going to give you citizenship to live for the rest of your life in Switzerland. What do you want to do? You can move your family to Switzerland, or you can give your life. We know you're going to be shot and killed if you go to Russia and Ukraine. What would you really choose? Would you really choose to give your life to fight for Ukraine, or would you rather just go to Switzerland and live there? Patrick: I don't know. I think it says something that I certainly don't jump immediately to giving my life. I think more about my responsibility maybe as a dad with two young kids than I do about going to fight. David: If somebody said to you today, ""Look, your children need your body parts. We're going to take your body parts out, but you're going to die. Each one needs a kidney. You've got two kidneys."" Well obviously everybody's prepared to give their life for their children. It's an interesting phenomenon. Their prepared to give their life for their children and nobody doubts that type of thing with very few exceptions. Patrick: Yeah. It's an incredible, interesting line to play with. I'm curious how it's evolved over time. I mean, obviously The American Experiment, as you titled the book, the experiment worked. By any measure, it seems to have worked out, so it was worth fighting for along the way. David: I think so. When you reach a certain age, you're younger than me, but you reach a certain age you say, ""Okay, I've had a reasonably good life. I'm now prepared to give up my life to protect my children, my grandchildren, and so forth."" I think almost most people would probably do that. You're young, so that's a Sophie's Choice for you. For example, if we were attacked militarily today by the Soviet Union, would you go volunteer knowing that volunteering and getting in the military you would be almost certainly killed? I guess you would say for the purpose of this, yes, but obviously, probably think about it a little bit more. My father's generation, they were prepared to go into World War II. They did, so called the greatest generation, and people didn't think twice about going in. In fact, they were embarrassed not to go in. Patrick: What do you think, looking back, is the period of your career where you felt them most alive? David: When you get an award that is meaningful. I think the thing that probably the most, when your mother calls you up and says, she's proud of what you've done with your life. When I was making a lot of money at Carlyle, my mother never called me and said Carlyle's making a lot of money, you're really rich and so forth and so on. When I started giving away a lot of money, she'd say, I'm really proud of what you're doing. When she passed away a few years ago, I went through all of her possessions, and the stuff that she saved, all the articles about me, were the ones where I gave away money not the things about how much money I'd made. What could be more fun than making your parents proud of you? That was something I felt good. When I do some things I've done to honor my parents, I redid the Iwo Jima Memorial, my father was a Marine, to honor him. I did some things in Washington to honor my mother. Those are things that you really feel good about. Patrick: What did you learn from your mom? David: Well, my mother was not an educated person. She dropped out of high school to get married. She was a person who was always very giving. She didn't have any money. When I got wealthy I gave her everything she would take. She didn't want much money because she thought it would change her life if I gave her too much money. After she passed away, I got her mailing address sent to my house and all her mail came to me. Every day I'd get 25 different philanthropic things that she would participate in by giving $10 to this one, $5 to this one, $25. These people are now, I get hundreds and hundreds of them and they're saying, ""Well, you haven't given anything in a year."" I said, ""Well, she died four years ago."" She was giving to everybody and she couldn't resist any appeal. She was a very giving person. Patrick: Amazing. How about your dad? David: My father was a former Marine. He worked in the post office his entire life. He was a typical blue collar worker. You don't work more than a minute overtime without getting paid. As soon as you can legally retire at 55, you retire because that's what you do. He didn't have a lot of intellectual interest. I was their only child, so they put a lot of energy into trying to help me get somewhere. Patrick: Well, David, I'm very inspired by your ongoing energy and just the prolific nature, as I said, of all the different things that you've done with obvious energy and curiosity and interest and impact. I ask everybody the same traditional closing question. What is the kindest thing that anyone's ever done for you? David: Well, the kindest thing anybody's ever done for me, I guess, is, of course aside from your parents raising you and trying to help you, and other relatives helping you along the way, is basically people introducing me to philanthropic opportunities where I can really make a difference. A lot of people have introduced me to really good philanthropic opportunities that I've now pursued and I've really been pleased with it. Of course, people have introduced me to people that help make my career and a lot of good introductions of people, so I'm indebted to a lot of people. Patrick: Wonderful. David, thank you so much for your time. David: My pleasure. Thank you very much. Congratulations on all you've achieved.This site uses cookies to improve your browsing experience.

177,Gaurav Kapadia - Everything Compounds,Introduction," Patrick: Our guest today is Gaurav Kapadia, founder of investment firm, XN. Gaurav is a veteran of the investing arena. We cover his lessons while rising to partner at TPG-Axon, co-founding, Soroban Capital and his decision to launch XN in 2020. We then discuss his approach to building XN around the culture of rigor and kindness, the importance of relationships in investing and finding investments that are obvious in retrospect. Please enjoy my conversation with my friend, Gaurav Kapadia.",123
178,Gaurav Kapadia - Everything Compounds,The Twin Pillars of Kindness and Rigor," Patrick: All right. So Gaurav, we're going to start with a matrix that I've been thinking a lot about since you sent it to me first. It's a cultural touchdown here at XN, which is this twin notion of kindness and rigor. Those are two terms in the investment world, or maybe in the world that some people might think are at odds with one another, meaning if you're kinder, you're less rigorous. If you're more rigorous, you're more of a dick. I think you're aspiring to have your activities and your firm's activities live in a unique quadrant in this matrix. So I'd love to spend quite a bit of time here to start. What's the story that led up to that decision of that as a cultural touchdown for what you're building here at XM? Gaurav: I think you're right. We strive to be in the upper right quadrant of kindness and rigor. I'll just take a step back, which is, like you I'm a student of so many investment organizations and one of the things that I found in the best places that stand the test of time is that they know what their culture is, and it's all self-reinforcing. It even goes back to our name, which is XN, which is if you see our logo X to the Nth power, which is everything compounds, that goes with culture too. But you also have to have a rubric to communicate what that culture means and a touchstone for people. At our first offsite, after we decided to raise outside capital, we said, ""How do we define who we are? How do we explain to internally and externally who we want to be?"" There's so many micro examples. There's I think we want to be the most ethical. We want to be the best partners. We want to be the most analytical, but how do you communicate that succinctly?One of the things I found is exactly what you said. A lot of the most rigorous investment organizations have a reputation of being assholes for being unkind, and the kindest investment organizations or organizations in general, have a tendency to get soft. But I don't think there's a dichotomy there. I think if you keep a cultural backbone, you could be both. And if you're both, you're so differentiated that it creates a foundation for ongoing success. If you talk to anyone, investments we've made, people we interact with, we are a pretty intense organization. We have a lot of rigor, but you will always find that we treat people well, that we act like good partners. By the way, sometimes acting kind is telling the truth. It's not just appeasement, and over the long term, people realize that that is kindness as well; honesty, compassion, really putting yourself in other people's shoes and really thinking of yourself as a partner. Patrick: Maybe you could describe the aspects of each of those dimensions where it ends up being the hardest, the types of situations in which it's the hardest to be rigorous or the hardest to be kind, because like any company values that might sit on someone's wall or in a poster or something, they're hard to disagree with ever. They're always aspirational and sound great and then are useless unless they're, as you've described, constantly in practice. At some point, it's hard to do that and it's the whole point. So maybe pick for each one, I'd love to do both, an example, an anecdote, whatever, when it was really hard to stick to that standard. Gaurav: The first thing is people con sometimes confuse what rigor is and what kindness is. Kindness doesn't mean just being unfailingly polite, or it can conflate the issue or being non-confrontational. One of the kindest things people do, they tell you the truth. Getting people in that mindset sometimes in the most difficult situation and most complicated interaction, the kindest thing to do is to say, as an example, tell someone that it's unlikely they're going to be promoted here or make a career here for the long run, and it hurts. I've had to do that many times. I'm crying, they're crying, but in the end it ends up almost unfailingly I get a call a few years later saying, ""You are totally right. That was the kind thing to do, and by the way, thank you for following up with me along the way to make sure I landed in the right place and mentor me, give me a reference,"" whatever that is.That's a good example of things that are over the long-term kind, but feel cruel in the moment. Just being honest and transparent as a measure of kindness, rigor, I think people get rigor wrong in investing a lot, especially people who come through a specific analytical background. It's not that you have to get your estimates or model perfect. That's actually almost like the table stakes. Of course everyone we hire, interview can do that. What's the rigor around it, which is how do you put pieces together? How do you take conclusions that are not obvious and stitch them together in a differentiated way? So that could mean chasing down some orthogonal competitor, going to a trade show. It could be looking at the end product. It could be just a different, more qualitative form of rigor. It doesn't need to be quantitative necessarily, but it has to inform the mosaic to make you a great investor or a great colleague. Patrick: Is the fair question around rigor to wonder for the person covering the security, whatever it is, the company, whatever it is you're looking at investing in, that you couldn't stump them on the important aspects of what's going on here with a business? Gaurav: I think that's right. You always see that when people get more senior over time, they have this tendency to ask the one question that the analyst or colleague is just not prepared for. Our president, David Bronstein, I started working for him when I was 22 at BCG. He used to do that all the time to me, and now I see myself doing it to people. Closing that gap is almost part of the rigor example, which is everyone who starts as an analyst or a different colleague can get the baseline answer, it has to be. But to get the insight, which is really what delivers differentiated investment returns is much harder, and it's usually their blind spot. Now, if you ask the question enough time, they become anticipatory of the broader view, so I think that's a great way to put it. Patrick: Our friend Feroz does this extraordinarily well where you'll see him listen, and then ask like the one incisive, pick the variable that's going to be the outcome and ask about that thing. What's an example of you doing that? The topic I want to get to here is what fundamentally has made you a good investor? What is an example that comes to mind of you looking at a specific investment situation and reducing the dimensionality of what will drive the investment outcome to as few as possible? What pops to mind? Gaurav: Organizationally, we have this ability to tie disparate pieces of information, block out the noise and tie them together. The way I've tried to define what that means for us as an investment organization or a firm, is to try to find things that are obvious in retrospect. If there's two main characteristics that we, I think, have it's that we like asymmetry. We think people have totally lost a thread for many years in a bull market, it's easy to do, on what the downside versus upside skew looks like, what the probability adjusted outcomes are, but that it's so easy to be stuck in the trenches that you don't take a step back and say, ""Hey, what's going to be obvious in retrospect?"" There's so many great examples, which now I'll say it, will sound obvious in retrospect. But in 2011, '12, '13, or '14, when we made this huge investment in the cable industry, the whole debate was, ""What's going to happen if people stop watching TV or move to Netflix or whatever it is?"" We just kind of said, ""Wait, hold on a second. They're the cheapest way to get broadband internet to your home. If you believe any of these things, and there's no regulatory pressure, the usage of broadband is going to go straight up and your pricing power, because you basically have localized monopolies, which I know you're not allowed to say if you're a cable executive, but I can as a cable investor, is that you do have pricing power, mixed power, customer relationship and then here we sit and it's fully obvious in retrospect. Charter consolidated the cable industry. Comcast has done a fantastic job. Turns out the very low profit margins they made on TV, even though it was high revenue was a sideshow.Another example is when we were making software investments that are transitioning from a license to subscription, it was actually very controversial at the time. People were like, ""How are they going to cross the chasm? What about cashflow degradation that happens with it?"" Now it's like, well you have a vertical software monopoly like, ""Oh yes, that's transition. I know how to do that."" But at the time it was hard to see even the way we built XN as an organization, I am actually really lucky three of the former executives and CEOs that we actually invested with behind these obvious and retrospect ideas actually work with us now as executive partners. So I remember AutoDesk, Carl Bass is one of our executive partners, people were so concerned that they wouldn't be able to make the transition between license to subscription. They forgot that they basically have a lock on all architects domestically, maybe globally, that the bill of materials is very small as it related to the total cost of an architecture job, and that we have the ability to tie in things that we were seeing both on the software side, but also given how much work we do on the industrial drills and construction side data points there, and so it was one of those things. I actually prepared a slide presentation for the board when they were under attack by activists. Here's what we view your competitive position as. We believe this is going to be obvious in retrospect that you have a great position, and I remember we actually put out a free cash flow per share target for them. That was an interesting one, because we were so convicted at the time. It felt very scary because there was a ton of volatility, a ton of disbelief, but in the fullness of time, it came out precisely to the right number. That was, I think, a reasonably fair example of how we tend to look at things. Patrick: How do you architect a team around this concept of obvious in retrospect? I know you had an offsite recently. You said you gave a presentation to the team, so I've got you standing up in front of a room in mind. What do you tell people or show people that allows them, not just you, as investors to notice these sorts of things? How do you train for something like this? Gaurav: I believe investing is an apprenticeship model. I have the greatest luxury. I started as a professional investor when I was 23 and I had great friends, colleagues and mentors literally around me. We're sitting here in my office. If you look at the office we have here, you'll notice that we're open architecture. I sit with all of my colleagues. My hope and we did this at Soroban, obviously, I benefited from TPG-Axon is that you show by doing and not just by saying, and that's a huge tenant of what we do here. I don't say one thing and then make everybody else do something else.The best way to do it is to show it, and we show it every day. I come here to the office every day, stand at my standing desk with my colleagues around me. I'm in all the management team meetings. I'm on the road all the time meeting companies, which I think is a really important piece of what we do with it, which has gotten lost a little bit in COVID, also a lot of other things, which is we create a culture where you're not afraid to make a mistake. What that does is allows you to open the aperture as to what you look for, because if you're so constantly afraid of being scolded, if you commit a foot fault, you can't allow yourself the intellectual freedom to look beyond the day-to-day, if that makes sense.",2742
179,Gaurav Kapadia - Everything Compounds,Lessons from Interacting with Company Management," Patrick: What have you learned about the art of interacting with company management? So if you spend a lot of time doing that and you want to show that to the team, if I compared you when you were 28 or something to you today in an important management meeting, how would you be different today and how you conduct those versus then? Gaurav: Interestingly, the 28 versus today I don't think is that different. I was very lucky in that I had a huge accelerator and a huge mentor very early in my career. So instead of going to investment banking or private equity out of college, I went to a consulting firm. I went to the Boston Consulting Group, and that it was a really interesting experience because when you're 22, you have to interact with senior management teams immediately, and so that's a real trial by fire. One of the things that I decided and I observed is very few investors, public or private view themselves as partners or advocates for the management team or companies. If you go to many meetings, they automatically start adversarial. They go, ""How much shares are you going to buy back? Why do you miss your margins?"" We never start by that. We lead with insight. We lead with work. We never go to a management meeting without tons of prep.Almost always, we have a significant prep document that we often share with the companies so they know from the outset that we have the long-term interest of the company at heart and that we're putting in the elbow grease to make sure that we understand what they're trying to accomplish. That alone has been a huge differentiator. Can you imagine 90% of investor interactions are like, ""Why didn't you do this for me lately?"" Hopefully, the ones with us are, ""We see a lot of potential. We think the world's not it. Help us understand it better. Can we help you understand how to communicate it better? What are we missing? How can we help? Do you need a customer introduction?"" That just changes the tenor of the conversation. That started for me really early because I had this luxury of starting, I think, as a consultant. I worked for people my whole career who became successful very early in their own careers. I was lucky to be able to do that too, so there's no hierarchy of seniority.I would walk in, be prepped and hopefully, be able to lead the meeting to ask important questions, develop a really good relationship. It's actually interesting, so these three executive partners that I mentioned and a bunch of the executives I still have relationships with. I met Carl when I was 24. I met Jan when I was 23 and I met Rob when I was 28. That relationship still carries through. One of the most gratifying things for me is that it's not just me anymore. If you look across the whole organization, look outside this conference room, everyone here brings that kindness and rigor, the insight, the management interactions that I really want to pride our organization around, they do it independently. One of the really fun things I've been able to observe, because I have some of my colleagues here that I've known for 20 years, worked with five or 10 and seeing them grow and be huge and impactful leaders and partners is great. My favorite thing these days is when I talk to a CEO and they're like, ""Hey, Gaurav. Great to see you. I'm good. I'll talk to one of your colleagues."" That's a great way for me to measure- Patrick: Success. Gaurav: -our impact. Yeah. Yeah. Patrick: Say a bit more about literally what a package that you might bring or send ahead of time to a company CEO or board or whatever might look like. What are the sorts of things that you like to investigate? Is it product strategy? Is it market approach? What are the dimensions that will typically find their way into one of those insight presentations? Gaurav: It really varies by type of company, probably the modal outcome though, you know the analogy of, if you have two runners to coach one, who looks perfect and runs a five-minute mile, the other one who looks clumsy and runs a five- minute mile, who do you want to pick? The second one? I say this with respect to all our portfolio companies on the public side in particular, but we often picked the second one. So a lot of it is the companies themselves are so in the weeds and investor attention is so diffused these days that it's like you have an exciting and important thing to communicate. First of all, are we understanding it correctly? Secondly, if we are, you should shout from the rooftops. That's the modal thing. There's a lot around controversies too, which we try to do outside in work to help companies understand on their own, which is, there could be a concern around competitive thread.Cable's a great example, because back in the early part of the last decade, people weren't doing the profit contribution of what TV was to the PNL of a cable company, and so we armed them with that, which is, ""Why don't you just tell people it's a lot of revenue, not a lot of profit and then people won't stress out about it?"" There's those aspects, we tend to find ourselves because we have this rigor mindset and I do believe to generate extraordinary investment returns. You have to go towards complexity, but then to realize those extraordinary investment returns, you have to decomplexify them. You have to simplify them in a way that you understand what the key value drivers are, and then you can hand that back to the company so they can do the same thing for their other shareholders. Patrick: What creates complexity? What are the most typical sources of complexity in the way that you mean it? Gaurav: I think there's a couple of different sources of complexity. One is, oftentimes companies that change points, so whether it is new business model transitions or M&A divestitures, changes in the end market, those create a lot of friction that the management teams often feel like they understand, but the investors don't. I'll give you an incredibly simple example. We have a portfolio company that announced that their margins are going to be lower on percent terms, and the whole market is freaking out about it. And really, when you double click into it, it's that they're adding incremental revenue that they never would've gotten, so it's dollar additive and percent margin dilutive. There's no reason to freak out. That's like a source of complexity that even something as simple as that, the market flips out around. Now, I do feel like over time, particularly in the public markets, to some extent, the private markets, as the rigor is waned and the analytical capabilities have waned as there's been so many companies that are there to evaluate, simple wins the day for multiples. But whether it's people have forgotten to do NOLs or refinancings, there's financial complexity, business model transition complexity, end market incremental margin complexity that we see pretty often. Patrick: Has rigor declined, do you think, in general, in public markets specifically over your career? Gaurav: A hundred percent. Not even close, in my opinion, or I think rigor has shifted. I think the rigor that you see on a short-term basis is very high, because as so much of capital has moved into organizations that are compensated on shorter-term cycles, as well as shorter-term results, the amount of rigor, whether it's data science, analytical capability on that is super high. The time horizon has shrunk a fair amount. Medium and long-term rigor has declined a ton and short-term rigor has gone up a lot, almost like what I think increased the opportunity for XN. Patrick: Why are fewer talented people, you think, going into public markets? Gaurav: I think there's a couple of aspects to it. Number one, fewer talented people are going straight into investing. And I think it's because there's a plethora of other great options that have been created that are also high paying and really intellectually interesting. You can work at a startup. You could actually just work at one of the large internet companies and get paid very well and have a great quality of life and do interesting stuff, which is actually different from like 10 or 15 years ago. I would say then within that, public market organizations, I feel like their star has dimmed relative to how attractive venture growth, even LBOs are, so you end up having a lot of the talented people wanting to build their pipeline there. And I don't think that's actually necessarily irrational for the candidate, because the probability adjusted outcome that someone's going to be successful in the public markets is just pretty low, because you have an indexing option that actually works reasonably well. And so there's this existential risk against that, that you don't have in some of these other investing capital pools.",1996
180,Gaurav Kapadia - Everything Compounds,The XN Investing Ethos," Patrick: We haven't talked much explicitly about XN, how it came to be. We talked about the culture a little bit, but not the organization itself. And I think one of the most interesting aspects of it, it is as an entity the thing that people talk about a lot, which is in an unconstrained world, where you're just trying to make the best investments without a specific mandate, that's what you do here. And so that spans public and private. You had the good fortune and the skill to be very successful very young, so you had what started as a family office in XN with a mandate to do what made the most sense. Not because some institution hired you to manage their public large value sleeve or something like that. You just do what made sense. So when you first began XN, what did that feel like? Did that change your mindset about where you spend your time, what you would go after? I obviously want to talk about publics versus privates and other things that you may be drawn to, but what was the most notable felt difference between just a purely unconstrained, using your own capital to begin. I know it's more than your own capital now. What did that feel like when you began it? Gaurav: I think that's worth maybe taking even a further step back, which is before I started XN at the family office, I wanted to, for me, get back to the joy and purity of investing. And as the same friend that you referenced earlier, Feroz, Feroz, I went out to dinner with him because he, obviously, when he left Tiger, he started Arena as a family office and he said, ""You have to decide, Gaurav, if you want to be in the AUM Hall of Fame or the IRR Hall of Fame."" I still tell everyone about that dinner. It was just before I was deciding to leave and it was in my head, and I was like, ""You know what? It's a good thing to look in the mirror and figure out what you want to be. The book that I want to write about our investment organization is we want to be in the IRR Hall of Fame."" The name XN popped into my head. X to the N power, that's what I want. That's what it means to me. So we set up XN as a family office because I actually did not think it would be compatible to get back to the purity of investing, to generate high returns with outside capital. I thought that there would be too many constraints even with the reputation and the relationships that I had to be able to do that effectively, so I set up my whole legal structure. You're sitting in the office. That was my family office. I'm going to go from 196 LPs to one LP. That's a pain in the ass, which is me, and then build the whole organization around that. And so literally, I walked out the door at Soroban. We renovated this office space, and roughly half the colleagues on the investment team worked with me in the family office.It was not a family office where I played golf every day. It's because I realized my passion was investing. I wanted to do it at a high level. I was 37 years old. Let's get after it. And then we did it for two years, and the couple of things are true. The joy and practice and love of investing came back. I'm as passionate as I've ever been and I don't have to worry about a lot of the constraints that other people have, in the sense that I can really work for the love of the game. And the second thing is, I was like, ""Man, we have something special here."" Once you distill investing to the purity and you can make that machine run, everyone looks around and says, This is awesome."" And so we set a very specific set of guidelines. I said, ""Look, I will always be the largest investor in the fund. We're going to have mission-driven partners with us. Our goal is to compound capital for the long run."" We have a very unusual structure, which has become less unusual over time, but where it's a commingled vehicle with the competition of capital across public and private, mandatory private allocation, very long duration lockups. That structure allowed us to keep the ethos of the compounding philosophy on returns, not have any pressure on the AUM side, and work with our partner to compound capital for the long run. And so that was the inflection point. Then we said, ""We have this great team,"" and really poured gasoline on the fire that we had ignited at XN as a family office, so that's how we created it and that's how we expanded it. And I'll say if I was 80% sure it was the right decision when we raised the outside capital, I'm like 110% convinced today, because we have the greatest capital partners you could ask for.It has enabled us to think more creatively about the organization and investing than I think other organizations have the luxury to be able to do. So as the largest investor with a fair amount of outside capital, relatively long lock-up, we'd say, ""How could public private investing change? What should we do? How should we tackle the problem? Let's take what we do to the family office and let's add resources to it. Let's add these executive partners who can bring us diligence, insight, authenticity, and an operator's mindset to evaluate public and private companies."" That, I believe still, we're one of the only or very few public private-focused funds that is able to do that in such an authentic way. Let's take our fantastic investment organization. Let's supplement it with resources so we have a diligence team, which is basically ex-consultants help support the analyst team. We have a data analyst. And let's not get too big in AUM, so we have the ability, the resources of a $50 billion fund and deploy it to a much wider array of investment opportunities. That's how it came to be, which is the outside capital to me was, is it going to be accretive to reputation and returns? I was not going to do it for a source of income or if it was modestly accretive to those things. But we saw this really interesting thing with some of the best investors in the world getting so big, they couldn't focus on a big part of the market, and that our team was revving and so special that I want to give them the fuel to get after the opportunities we were seeing. That's how we ended up with outside capital. Patrick: When you and I were together at a mini conference with a group of some of the best investors in the world, I think people would certainly look at that room and say, ""Yeah, this is sort of the active hall of fame,"" if you will. What is your impression of a room like that again today versus the course of your career? Because a lot of those people now are doing crossover investing. They're doing publics and privates. What is that room like to you from this new perspective? Gaurav: That was a pretty uniquely good room. We kind of had a great crew together. I would say I'm very impressed with my peers. I think you're really seeing a separation in talent, franchise, et cetera, but I will say the Tigers and the Coatues and Altimeters of the world have developed really great organizations and franchises. Now, we also are trying to do something different. There's a tendency to think of us all kind of the same, but I would say there's two things, and you saw this. One is we're all rooting for each other, and that's, I think, one, endemic to the personalities of the people involved, but also that we realize that we're such a small part of such a big opportunity that you can root for your peers and colleagues without taking the knives out, and that's a great place to be. Number two is at XN, because of our depth of industry expertise outside of just technology, the aperture widens a bit, and so we can take the same toolkits and apply them to a wider variety of areas. And that, to me, is also a big opportunity. If we were just doing SAS investing or FinTech, I'd just pick up a hobby and give my money to somebody else. Patrick: Say now a bit more about the nature of public versus private investing today in terms of whether or not really different things matter to you when considering opportunities in those two buckets. You said something earlier for your recording that I think the average market cap is fairly low of things in the portfolio, like 15 billion or something. I think I'm getting that right. What is the tangible difference between the two? Is there a difference, really? Do you care? Gaurav: I think there's less of a difference than other people do, honestly. The way I think about our XN is it's a research organization that can monetize its research by being long public equity, being long private equity, and occasionally being short public equity. If you have that mindset, you have to apply the same skills throughout. There are other people who do it really well, where they have disparate investment processes against their public investing and their private investing. That's not the way we generally work. We like actual businesses that generate revenue, that are product market fit, that we think we have an insight into how they can grow, how their business model works, and that are kind of agnostic if it's public and private. There's a lot of synergies between public and private.Now, in private markets, the competition ebbs and flows in a really interesting way. And so you have to be really careful not to overpay at the wrong point in the cycle and believe a story, the other part of the cycle. Now, one of the things that we've infused of the outset is even as the world is becoming very rapid response private equity on the private side, we weren't going to play that game. We were just going to focus on insights, access, value add, industry expertise, long-term duration, being able to hold when you're private to when you're public, and we're not going to participate in auctions and we're not going to be sold a story. We did that at the very beginning, even as a family office, and that has held us in good stead because that discipline, I think, will carry our private portfolio through what's been and I imagine will be a pretty complicated time from here on out. Patrick: When you are approaching a new company for the first time... For some reason, Airtable is popping to mind. I know you're an investor at Airtable. How do you get to know a company when you've never heard of it before? If you're just approaching something for the first time, and I realize that as you've gotten more and more experience, there's more and more touch points to build a map around a business, but what is the personal process you have for getting to know a business from scratch? Gaurav: Well, the great thing is we have 35 people here in our areas of expertise are always great spotters. We're never doing something really cold. Even if you look at Airtable, it's a great example. I've admired the company. I've admired the product for a long time. I was lucky enough to get to know Howie probably four or five years ago, and we kept in touch. I think one of the things that people find, actually, right after this, I have my catch up with Howie, is that everyone at the firm, including myself, is very accessible. You can call me. That's who you get. And that authenticity that you're dealing with, the principle always helps. There's two things. You find a company. You have the diligence outside in and you got to know the management team. I think one of the things you find is any individual is always dealing with some problem, whether it's you, whether it's me, and if you can position yourself as a resource, whether or not you ever invest, to be able to talk that problem out, use your experience, bring that to bear, you end up being a huge value added partner, whether or not you invest. That's like a bit of the ethos of the rigor and the kindness, which is Howie, I would've loved to invest mid points, but we just developed a relationship. I really believed in him and the organization. In a weird twist of fate of why it makes sense to always carry this kind and this ethos through the CFO of Airtable, and I started as tobacco analyst basically in 2004.Being a good actor for a long period of time pays lots of dividends, which I tell the firm, the offsite, the speech I gave. That was like, ""Remember, the IR person, the junior IR person is now the CFO of this company."" It could be in many ways, treat people with a respect. So just on an individual level, I think we first outside in, try to identify the best-in-class companies or the themes in the verticals we care about. We exclude so much of the world. We don't do any healthcare. We don't do balance sheet-heavy financials. There's so much that we exclude that we can really focus on the areas that we have a very deep expertise in. Then it's an analytical, personal, and long-term oriented relationship we strive to build with every company that we interact with. I would say the interesting thing is we're very selective. We actually only have 21 private investments since inception, but our relationships and our shadow hopefully is a lot longer than that, and that's what we strive to build. Patrick: You mentioned the balance sheet-heavy financials or healthcare, when there are things that almost from a policy standpoint, you don't invest in. What are the reasons? Gaurav: It's very simple, actually, which is if I don't think we have a shot at being among the best, we don't do it. I don't think I'm going to be a better biotech investor than the Baker Brothers, so I'm not going to do that. That narrowing of focus really helps you build these deep, vertical expertises and stops you from being a dilettante. What always kills people in investing is they go off piste. They become like a dilettante in something because they're reaching for something to do, so we've eliminated that temptation. Patrick: I absolutely love the notion of trying to figure out what problem each company or leader of a company is dealing with at a given moment and having that be the wedge of the initial relationship. Is there a common pattern that you observe of those problems? What are the most common problems that you see people dealing with? Gaurav: One thing that investors don't often realize is the stock price or the investor is often the last thing on the guy's list of all the stuff he has to deal with. He has HR. He has an uprising at his company. He has unionization issues. So on the plethora of things they have to deal with, most likely, the thing that's most important to you, it hasn't even crossed their mind. And so being humble enough to know that is half the battle. You really try to understand. And by the way, you've got to do the work. It's not like you just go and ask nice questions. Our largest public position is a company called Wabtec. It's a combination of three mergers. There's a big NOL. There's a bunch of filings that you got to tie through. And once you do that, you kind of have an idea of what the issues are. How do I integrate this business? How do I go after these customers? What's this transition to green energy going to do for the locomotive business? You focus on that and that opens up the aperture. Once you really hit what the CEO thinks or the core issues of the business, it really opens up your understanding of what the core issues of the business are. They're not the same as what the rank and file industrial or sell side report would say. Patrick: Yeah, I love the idea that you are the bottom of the priority list of the person that you're meeting. All too true, all the time. What are the then features of the business if you have a strike zone or an area of focus where you can potentially be that Jack Welch best-in-class or whatever? What defines that strike zone? Gaurav: Investing is complicated in two ways. You have to get the business right and then you got the valuation right. I think there's people who are reasonably good at getting the business right. I think we're hopefully better and we're applying more analytical rigor and toolkits. Because even on the public side of the portfolio, we only have 10 to 12 positions at any time, so we could go really deep in them. And we hold them oftentimes for years and years and years, so we really have a long, longitudinal history. And now, we actually hold them from private to public, so we would have all that data too. Hopefully we're better at that, and so there's usually like an insight or a kernel that we see that the market doesn't see. ""Oh, the incremental margins are going to be so much higher."" ""Actually, your market share in green locomotives is 20 points higher than your existing ones, and that's a positive mix shift."" Or luxury's going to move online. What's the best way to capture that? So there's some business insight. You got to marry though that business insight with asymmetry of share price in public or private. And so that's really the art of investing. What you're trying to find, generally speaking, is really good business that's valued as a poor business or a mediocre business, that has the ability to compound through. That's what I think we excel at, is this asymmetry with the business analysis. And so what that often manifests itself is you end up having optionality on multiple expansion and compounded capital growth in terms of free cash flow per share or something like that in the public or the private side.",3967
181,Gaurav Kapadia - Everything Compounds,What Makes a Business Remarkable," Patrick: With that in mind, what has it been like for you watching the move from, we'll call it 2018 through to today, sort of a round trip now of these insane valuations in public markets, especially in tech? Gaurav: The funny thing is, to some extent to our detriment, we never bought into it. There was this tendency, especially you go to the beginning of 2021, where you're like, ""Am I wrong? Am I missing something? Should everything trade at 25 times revenue? Is that what the baseline has to be?"" I think there's a couple of insights that you have going back 10 or 15 years. In the last couple years, for sure. There's a lot that rhymes with post-financial crisis and also post-internet bubble, which is there are very few good businesses. That's the thing that I think is really coming to fore as we sit here today is people realize that actually most internet businesses are highly fragile. In many cases you don't control your own destiny, whether it's through IDFA or customer funnel or margins. It's an interesting thing because there's this tendency to go internet up, that's not universally the case. There's some great internet businesses, but the world is littered with mediocre and now bankrupt internet business. So that's the interesting thing to me, which is a lot of the high, multiple businesses were never deserving of it. And COVID ended up masking so much of it that it's coming back to earth and is going to leave to this differentiation, at least we think. Patrick: If you step back for me, it's so strange to think of the idea that there are very few great businesses. Why do you think that's the case? That's a strange concept. Gaurav: If you look at any of the data about how many companies are in the S&P 500, how long do they stay in there? It's just very few because every thing is hard. Our business is hard. You know what's hard? Running General Electric is really hard and keeping that sustainable competitive advantage going for as long while you have the pressures of being a public company is very, very difficult. So when you really distill it, there's just very few scenes that you can mine without competitors coming through and really disrupting that business model in any significant durable way. Patrick: Are there common attributes of the great ones? Everyone talks about the same seven powers, five forces, like it's all the same kind of lingo around where defensibility might come from for a business. Do you buy all that? Gaurav: I buy it at a first order implication, of course, but really when you go down to it, if you look at a lot of the great businesses, they've created niche monopoly things. No one likes to say it because you're not allowed to say it, but look, if you look at any of the great software businesses, they took a very specific vertical and they kind of said, I'm going to own this vertical. If you look at even at the great industrial businesses, because they many returns to scale, they say this is a great vertical for me, I'm going to have 50 to 70% market share and therefore my margin is going to be a lot better, et cetera, et cetera. Look at aircraft engine manufacturers, people say, oh, they're broad industrials, but really they're a monopoly on narrow body or wide body.So I think people sometimes confuse themselves with what is good business and if the CEO talks in a shareholder friendly way, is that a good management team? It's almost like the opposite in my experience, which I'm happy to talk about. But really you have to see if the underlying business has a characteristic that's going to give them pricing power and volume growth in a way that's differentiated and protected from others. And there's many ways those moats, could be network effects, of course, which obviously Bill [Gurley] talks about, but it could also be superior product that is really hard to replicate, it could be patents. My favorite is so many companies have started doing this, whether it's the medical device companies or Autodesk, giving their products away in grad school. So you become the defacto monopoly later, that's a great strategy. But you have to figure out where those niches and seams are. Patrick: Say more about that thing you just referenced around your experience with the opposite of posturing around shareholder friendly or whatever. Gaurav: Look, I think we've all seen it for many years, which is, having someone talk the talk of an investor talk may in the short run lead to a high multiple. In my experience you want someone, whether or not they're a founder, with a founder mentality or duration and compounding mentality for the long run. That is hard to find, but if you find it you can look through the language they say and really what they do and what they mean. So much of investing is getting to the truth and the core of what they're doing and not necessarily what they're saying. That's what I found to be amongst the most effective. There are some rare cases where the management team has everything buttoned up. They say the right things, they do the right things, et cetera. I think those are generally the... I mean, Frank Slootman who was just on, obviously a great example. Snowflake has internal metrics, they have a high degree of rigor. Patrick: Put it mildly. Gaurav: They communicate very clearly. But those are generally speaking the minority. Patrick: What do you think are the biggest problems in the investment industry writ large? Gaurav: Part of the reason that we set up XN the way we did, which is almost impossible for us to get away from compounding being the biggest source of value. The principal agent issues are just enormous in investing. I think it's particularly acute in private investing, but also public investing, which is we have principal agent issues all through the chain. The analysts have a principal agent issue with portfolio manager. You have the founders having principal agent issue with the investors, they're paid off of something that is or thought kind of correlated but not directly with the objectives of the underlying institution. That leads to a very complicated set outcomes. And in the end principal agent issues always come to the fore. So if you haven't specifically designed against them, it somehow corrodes the investment organization, in my opinion. Which is part of the reason why the investment organization that I respect the most, many of them, they have that founder's mentality, compounding mentality, as the driver of what drives them and not a fee based mentality as the driver that drives them. I would also say the allocators themselves have their own principle agent issues that they have to deal with internally. And so it's like investing today, which is part of the reason why originally I thought family offices is the only way it could because the only way to get purity of principal agent issues is to be the principal and the agent. It's just like a long stream of conflicting interests. Patrick: What is the most remarkable business that you've ever seen? Forget price and valuation, just the most remarkable business. Gaurav: I think Google's up there. Of course, I think people say all the classic ones like Visa, MasterCard and Alphabet, I think those are reasonable. One of the great businesses, hotel C-corps. So Marriott and Hilton, as an example, they basically manage and run a royalty stream on all of the brands under their umbrella. It is one of the most beautiful businesses I've seen because other people spend all the capital, they come to you for branding, they come to you for management and then pay you a strip of revenues that is extremely high margin. So your return on capital is extraordinarily high because everyone else applies the capital and you get a royalty, your long inflation. One of these really durable franchise businesses, in my opinion, I happen to like the hotels significantly more than say other franchise restaurant concepts are incredible. Long the consumer, travel, globally, forever. All you have to do is invest energy in the brand, somebody else provides the CapEx at a much lower cost capital than you, you get to ride that forever. On the private side one of the things that has been really awesome for us is this intersection of physical and digital, where people are solving really hard problems, and only in the last couple of years is due to machine vision or machine learning or distributed GPUs or whatever technological base loading that happened, they're able to apply it really effectively. One of our portfolio companies is a company called AMP Robotics, they do machine learning and machine vision for recycling. We went out to visit them in Denver, it was amazing, it was an eye opening experience. They had a flatbed just dump a bunch of garbage on a conveyor belt and sorted it.If you think about who used to do that before, it was low wage workers with high attrition, probably weren't living their best life, hard to keep in stock. If you look at what problem it solves for the world, think about our natural resource constraints, think about ESG, think about carbon footprint. You're able to automatically, basically, at very low cost sort and recycle trash at very high margins. I love this intersection of physical and digital. I also think that not a lot of people are paying attention to it. It's really hard. We have a team internally and with our executive partners who can evaluate these both on a technical and business model basis. AMPs really interesting because we have experience looking at the waste management companies. So we understand what the PNL they're plugging into, and we also see where tightening natural resources, commodity costs are going up. It's a great way to earn the area under the curve while no one's looking. So we have a few investments in this regard. But that's something that is really, really, really interesting, where you can plug into existing profit stream and business model, use technology to upend it and there's returns to scale. Because with AMP, as an example, you're classifying all sorts of garbage and so your machine learning models are so much more advanced than anybody else. Believe today they can, for a given yogurt container, tell you which one has titanium dioxide and which one doesn't. And so then if you think about titanium dioxide is something that you want to recycle or save, you can segment that separately. That that's the level. In my house we just go paper are plastic or whatever, if you think about the implications of that and also the competitive moat for that, that's going to be like incredibly compelling. Patrick: If you had to teach other investment firms to successfully deploy this model of the operating partners that you've mentioned earlier, the three that you're working with, what do they do? What does unlock? How could others effectively run a program like that? Gaurav: The lessons that we learned were it has to be authentic, everything we do is authentic here. It can't be you want some guys resume for a pitch deck. It has to be, this is what our goals are, this is what our objectives are and this is the relationship we have to build the foundation of trust. In the case of the three executive partners we have, we obviously have known other for a very long time and have worked in the trenches together, which really helps solidify the relationship and make sure that there's real alignment and backbone into it. Originally when we started, we said there's probably two things, insight and access. So insight on any given, we're looking at a satellite internet provider, Rob Marcus is going to have a really good understanding of what the economics look like, et cetera. Or we need credentializing factors to be able to have access to like these really interesting public or private companies, and that's been very effective. I would say incremental to that there's been two learnings. One is our team benefits from the mentorship of these executives to see investing through the lens of an operator in a way that massively expands their horizons.Even the last couple off sites the executive partners are there, they're there the whole time, they're hanging out with us all night. The relationships that they build in understanding complex problems helps the analyst team really understand what the CEOs that they're interfacing with are dealing with. The second thing is if you're building a company, this is the golden age of entrepreneurship, you often need mentors. It turns out many of the entrepreneurs today reach out to executives who've gone through it all. Taken a company public, did a complex integration, did a business model transition, being attacked by activists, et cetera. They seek out these teams as mentors, and that has allowed us interesting access to private things pretty early. I think the executive partners have helped really well with that. So long way of saying it has to be a deeply authentic relationship in order for it to work.",2862
182,Gaurav Kapadia - Everything Compounds,"Diveristy, Inequality, and Childhood Stories"," Patrick: One of the issues that I know you care a lot about in the investment industry which just seems to have incremental improvement but is still fundamentally broken, is just diversity of the people in the industry. Walk me through this issue from your perspective, what you think can be done about it, what's being done about it? Something I know you take really seriously. Gaurav: I am so disappointed in our industry. I think whether it's ethnic diversity, gender diversity, in any part of the organization we have just done an awful job. And I will say, I don't think my eyes were fully open to it until the last few years. And I say that with the degree of disappointment in myself. We take diversity very seriously, obviously we have a DI coordinator here, we try to live the values. One of the things that I feel like you have to unpack is it an authentic value or a check the box? Our industry is basically in check the box mode. You get a form, are you diverse, yes or no, they put the full somewhere, no one ever sees it again. We said we're going to go the complete other way. We're going to go full authenticity because it relates to our mission. So our mission is generate really good returns for our investors, we believe a diversity of opinions will help us generate superior returns. If you tied into the business objectives, it becomes a lot easier. We're a majority minority owned, we have 60% people of color or women on the management committee. I'm proud of what we have done but we're going to do a lot more. I think there's a few things that we're doing. This spans not only at XN but my role on investment committees outside of XN, and hopefully as someone takes seriously as an investor and as a civic leader. The number one framework I have is we're not going to let other people's implicit bias become our implicit bias. So when you're an investment organization you tend to hire people who've gone through some training steps. If that training step has an implicit bias, it'll affect you. We're going orthogonally more creative to find different pools of candidates. Number two, is one of the things I decided is I'm going to personally, not just run through our recruiting process, but particularly people of color and women I'm going to do all the first interviews, seek them out myself. That has two impacts. One, people know I'm serious and that it's a comfortable place to be. That has actually been hugely effective step we've taken. One of the things we're contemplating is actually doing things a little bit more seriously and not just LPs asking us what our DI plan is, but us asking them.The interesting thing right now is people feel so much tangential pressure that they just have people do a questionnaire, but a lot of times I look at the screen and the organizations themselves aren't diverse. So it would be helpful for us as an organization that actually doesn't need the capital, that is doing it in service of greater mission to understand if our partners are truly aligned with our belief that diversity is going to improve them and improve us. I would say, watch this space, we're contemplating along with a couple of partners including large philanthropic institutions, endowments, taking a much more significant step because I think it's just a huge opportunity. I don't think anyone's heart is in the wrong place, I think everyone's heart is in the right place. So we have to stipulate that, people really care, but so many decisions are made by network. And so the only way you can break down existing network effects is with data. One of the big things that we're doing both on the investment committees I sit on, my role as DI chair in a couple other places and at XN is to get the data and share the data. There's this weird perception that being diverse is going to hurt your returns, obviously all the data says the exact opposite. So let's help ship that data, let's help inform that. And then finally, I think sometimes it helps to have a bit of escape velocity. If you're a minority manager or woman manager that's really just hard to get. So some of the things that we're incubating is the little bit of capital outside XN which is very deminimis that goes to managers of generally people of color and women. Hopefully we get them a little bit of headstart, a bunch of advice, reference calls, et cetera, with the goal of that their returns are just as good and if they have a little bit of escape velocity, they can become the next great investment organization. Patrick: You said earlier one of the ideas on behind kindness is just the truth, even if the truth is uncomfortable. I'm really interested in this notion of seeing the truth and speaking it to being the best path to growth for anybody. It seems like that same concept just applies here as well with getting the data, getting it out there. It's not more complicated than that, but for some reason that doesn't happen enough. Gaurav: It doesn't because there's always this concern that you're making the wrong decision, whether it's the investment committee. So it's just a lot easier, it's like the old no one gets fired for picking IBM, it applies to existing investment organizations as well. Now, when you really dig into the data, as far as I can tell, there's a lot more choices than are presented. Some organizations, Camden Associates, Albourne, et cetera, have done a decent job of mapping it out. But now you got to take that empower investment committees to make an authentic decision around diversity. The thing you don't want to do because it'll stab the effort immediately is take a check the box approach, because if you don't keep the mission of the organization in mind and how diversity is going to improve that and it becomes a check the box exercise, the minute things falter it goes away. And so that's what I think we'll see in the investment community has to push forward. Patrick: This is kind of a strange way of asking a question, but if you could set aside IR completely and not care about investment returns and could own any business or institution outright yourself personally, what would you pick? Gaurav: Any institution at all? Post office. It's like the ultimate turnaround. I'm just making this up. They have the best footprint in the US by far. If you look at logistics as a growth area that's been taken by private sector, it's up into the right. Your cost assures should be lower, your cost to serve consumers should be lower, the ability to provide government and other services should be very high. My guess is one of the most under monetized resources in the world. Patrick: Maybe we'll put you in charge of that in the next life. What things outside of investing most have your intention today? Gaurav: DI is high on the list. I'm not sure how much you know about me and how I grew up, but I grew up immigrant family, first generation American proverbial, my dad lived at the YMCA, got off a flight to India, no one picked him up the airport and moved to the YMCA with 20 bucks in his pocket. In one generation I've had the luxury of being me. There's so much to unpack from that but to me, it's essentially the American dream. And so I view a lot of my role both at XN but outside of XN is to help other people fulfill the American dream. And that means reducing barriers, increasing opportunity. I care a lot about that. And you see that, we got to know each other a little bit, but there's a civic thread that runs through it. And the funny thing for me is it happened in such a weird way. I took a test when I was 11 years old, I got into the school called Hunter and it changed my life. It totally changed everything, my opportunity set, I got to go to an Ivy League school, all the stuff. And it was one test on one day, if I had a bad Saturday it wouldn't have happened. And to me, I don't feel like the American dream should be that accidental. My wife and I are reasonably focused on increasing the opportunity set across those philanthropic areas, so that's a big focus. Patrick: Hunter used to kick our asses in chess all the time, they were like the Death Star of eight year old chess. Gaurav: That experience to me was a really interesting one. I went there, kid from Queens, coming to Manhattan. It was the most authentically diverse place I've ever been, still to this day. The interesting thing is it was test based, we had large black community, large Latino community, large Asian American community, obviously 50-50 gender and people say it can't be replicated outside. That's to me, kind of confusing given that the structure that I went through and witnessed. So that's a big part of my time outside of work. Obviously, you and I share this other passion which is raising our kids, which is the most frustrating joy and most fun you can ever have. Patrick: Can we talk a bit more about the tour related kids and this notion, I'll call it on-ramps. For me, who's the born sliding into home American, the notion that we don't emphasize the opportunity for more immigration for more opportunity for more on-ramps is the most profoundly strange thing. If you just study our history, like what made the country, what was this phenomenon itself? And then there's this resistance to it. I'm not a political beast, but this is the issue for me that just drives me nuts. So I'd love to understand it from your perspective and your story in a little bit more depth. So what did it feel like as a kid? What are the salient touch points of that experience coming from Queens, going to Hunter? What are the things that matter when you look back? Gaurav: In the seventies, when my parents came to America, America had a Visa program. They gave a green card to anyone who was a doctor, a lawyer, an accountant, or an engineer. So if you look at that generation who are basically my generation's parents, they came here highly educated, big impact on the communities. And they've been able to raise broadly a generation of successful people. To me, that seems like a very obvious immigration policy, right? When we're short staffed. In fact, even Donald Trump endorsed it before he became anti it when he was a private citizen. I think skills based immigration programs and ability to draw community in as opposed to push people out, that inclusiveness is what's made my experience in America great. I'd also say being an immigrant kid, and there's a lot of them here, is hard. I have so much respect for my parents' Indian accents, dress funny, keep their culture while raising an American family. Both working, no internet or cell phones. And that definitely shaped a lot of who I am, which is keeping the core, ethical compass of what you do, remembering where you came from. But also even from an early age, remember you got to give back and do your best and try your hardest and drive that. One of the things that's interesting is I think the immigrant mentality as people call it is applicable to everybody. The thing about the most successful people you know who were born on third base, they have that same grit, ethos, desire, ethical compass, intelligence to do it too. It's not some experience that necessarily caused it. You just got to remember to keep exporting it. Patrick: This gets back to the notion of the relationship with kids. When you think back in your relationship with your parents during those formative years, what stands out? Because I do think if there's anything we can do for the kids, we can probably create a certain type of relationship that ends up being very productive for them that doesn't leave them spoiled little shits and lets them have the same mentality. If you think back on your relationship with your parents as a barometer for that, what stands out? Gaurav: Big part of my ethos is remembering how hard my parents worked, how hard they tried, observing the values as it reflected hard work, but also how much they cared about their kids and their success is hard to balance. As we know as parents, how do you put my all into work, try to make ends meet? So getting that balance right, it's like people always say you only get it when you become a parent, how hard that is. One of the things that has affected me the most is now that I'm where I am, if I knew how rigged the system was, I would've stopped trying. One of the things that I think has propelled me and a lot of people here at the firm, my friends and colleagues is this optimism that was imbued early on that America's a meritocracy. So that's what I got from my parents. I left the city in India to come here because you can make it here. You could be anything. When I was 10 years old, my mom was like, ""You can go to Harvard."" I'm like, ""What's Harvard?"" That optimism and excitement is very important to me to continue to give to my kids that we can't make America a rigged system. We have to say that boundless optimism that we imbue to our children will allow them to not think there's any barriers, even if there were. I didn't even know there was a thing called legacy. I just assumed Ivy League school, they just take the best kids. Learning that obviously is like a little discouraging after you go to college. You have to keep that spirit alive, in my opinion. Patrick: What are the ways in which you think that notion of rigged system are most manifest today? Like if we were to rip some of those things out. Gaurav: If I had to pick one thing? Patrick: Yeah. Gaurav: I would have a 95% inescapable estate tax. And I think one of the things that compounds obviously with the cleverness of our estate planning techniques today is generational wealth leads to a decline in optimism and more strictures that become hardened, if you will. If you asked me one policy thing I would do is I'd lower the income tax and massively raise the estate tax. Let people enjoy their life, but not for generations and generations. Patrick: What would number two be? Gaurav: I think there's a number of policy proposals that can actually increase inclusivity in the work place. If you gave people the ability to deduct childcare, that friction wouldn't exist because of that post-tax, pre-tax dollars. One of the things that we have, even when we hire people, women have often left a workforce whether or not they want to or not because of this choice that the government gives them of like, do you want to stay home? So I think there's an architecture to make policy a bit more flexible to increase inclusivity, increase workforce participation. So that's the other idea that we've been kicking around.",3356
183,Gaurav Kapadia - Everything Compounds,Reasons to be Optimistic," Patrick: We're sitting here at the end of February 2022 just for posterity purposes, looking forward from today, what has you most excited about... I'm kind of going back to the investing hat here, but industry or the economy or what's being built. Where are you the most optimistic based on what you see in the landscape today? Gaurav: Two or three things make me really optimistic and excited. Number one, I think one of the things that have happened through COVID is people have realized that we've underinvested in our infrastructure. We don't have enough redundancy. So I think you're going to go through a cycle of people from a national interest perspective, i.e. semiconductors, but also from like a business interest perspective of like, ""Hey, we should probably more capacity and not have such a tight supply chain so what happened in 2021 doesn't happen again."" I think that's going to be a theme to invest behind very successfully. And it has all sorts of adjuncts. Like how do you decarbonize things? How do you just add more capacity? How do you de-bottleneck? How do you automate?So if you look at a lot of our investments, everything from like the Wabtech, which is going to generate locomotives and vehicles for metals and mining, but also through our private investments that do a lot of things in robotics that take what's quote unquote lower skill jobs and automate them so people can have dignity and have better work. I think that's going to be a theme that's going to be around for a long period of time. I think as we sit here, one of the things that I also think is going to be obvious in retrospect and excites me a lot is people are going to want to have fun again. It has been a two year slog. I think next week is the two year anniversary of me hiding out with my kids doing remote school. The US and us all have been fits and starts and we've kind of, I'll speak from me and my friends, kind of forgot to have fun a bit because it's been really stressful. We got a global pandemic. We're worried about our kids. We're worried about our parents. We're worried about ourselves. Someone reminded me we're sanitizing groceries. Patrick: Amazon boxes with those stupid wipes. Gaurav: I think when we come out of that, we're going to be really excited to have fun, see friends, take our kids to a theme park, stay in a hotel. Think about what we were talking about before. That to me is pretty obvious. I also think we are still in the super early innings of software infrastructure productivity being massively enhanced. Software in particular, vertical software, specifically. Tools that unlock productivity I think are going to be a really fun spot to watch because a combination of people realize you can be remote, but even if you're remote, you got to collaborate. You got to be with your colleagues. And what are tools that help us push us in that direction are another investment theme. But I think those three things make me pretty excited. Patrick: Is there anything we haven't talked about that's incredibly important to you? Gaurav: One of the things that I would just touch on is investing is such an amazing craft. It's so hard to do every day. People who have been mentors indirectly or directly to me or others deserve a ton of gratitude. Everyone from Nick Sleep publishing his letters on the Nomad Partnership. I've never met Nick Sleep. I've learned a lot- Patrick: Shared economy scaled. Gaurav: Yeah. To Warren Buffet who both of us have been lucky enough to have dinner with. And he takes his role as a mentor so seriously where it can be approximate mentors who helped you along the way. I think in a business that's so difficult and apprenticeship based, having people who are willing to teach, be openhearted, has been one of the hallmarks in my career. And I hope we all celebrate those mentors as much as we can. Patrick: That's definitely a great excuse to ask my traditional closing question. What is the kindest thing that anyone's ever done for you? If the mentorship you just described is sort of a general category of kindness, what's the specific answer for you personally? Gaurav: The hardest thing and the most effective thing to do with kindness is believing in someone when they don't believe in themselves. That's not just believing in someone. It's like really giving them at the time, their darkest place, where they feel less confident like the attaboy. My mom, I know everyone says that, but foundational in doing that. Really believed in me what I really did not believe in myself the whole way through. I was very lucky. I had this teacher, Miss Manganelle. I never spoke to her again. She was my first grade and fifth grade teacher. Encouraged me to take the Hunter Test. That Hunter Test changed my life. And then I showed up to Hunter with my bad fashion and acne and all this other stuff and a teacher named Cas Adler-Ivanbrook, who I will be forever thankful for, taught me about economics, took me under his wing and allowed me the foundation of success. And then finally, I met Dinakar Singh who founded TPG Axon when I was 23 years old. He believed in me and gave me the opportunities so early in my career and sat next to me for years to help me. And I have tremendous gratitude for all four of those people. Believing in someone when you don't believe in themselves at any given point is the kindest thing that anyone's ever done for me. Patrick: Well, it's been so much fun. I knew it would be. It's been a pleasure getting to know you in the last several months. And I suspect we might do this every few years or something. Talk about the world. Thank you so much for your time. Gaurav: Thank you.This site uses cookies to improve your browsing experience. By using this site, you are consenting to this policy.",1392
184,Marko Papic - A Multi-Polar World,Introduction," Patrick: Our guest today is Marko Papic, Partner and Chief Strategist at Clock Tower Group, where he leads the firm's research on macroeconomics and markets. Marko has spent his career at the intersection of finance and geopolitics, making him a perfect person to speak to about current events in Ukraine and their potential impact further afield. Along with Russia and Ukraine, we discussed the Fed, inflation, China, the Green Energy Transition, and the U.S.'s position in the global order. Please enjoy this discussion with Marko Papic.",125
185,Marko Papic - A Multi-Polar World,The Ukraine-Russia Conflict and the Evolution of Warfare," Patrick: So Marko, maybe the appropriate place to begin, I guess we have to given what's going on in the world, is just with your up to date, we're recording on March 8, 2022, your current snapshot of what is happening in Ukraine, Russia, and how it has evolved in the first 10 to 14 days or so of the conflict. I want to start there because it's the most important thing happening in the world, but then obviously spend a ton of time talking through near-term and long-term investing and economic implications of what's happening, but let's orient the audience by you describing your interpretation of what's happened so far. Marko: Let me give you a figure before we begin there. The first year of the war in Iraq in 2003, U.S. lost about 500 troops. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, so this is Russian official data, they lost about 500 troops in the first five days of the war. Now you can multiply that by some sort of coefficient that adjusts for their propaganda, the fact of the matter is that the first thing I want to talk about is the failures of Russia in Ukraine, that were by the way telegraphed by some obvious material constraints we can talk about later, but I'm just going to outline some of the things that have happened thus far.First, they've conducted this multi-pronged attack that has basically divided their forces. It's eight lines of attack, it's almost performative art, it's like watching a Bolshoi Theater performance. It's performative, amphibious assault in Mariupol, paratroopers, multiple lines of attack. To me it's idiotic. I mean it's the only way I can describe it and I've studied war for a long time in my career. The US in Iraq had two lines of attack, they both went from the south. Second, they conducted zero SEAD operations, Suppression of Enemy Air Defense, just didn't do it. They were like, ""YOLO, let's roll in with the tanks. We're good."" That was really stupid because Ukraine has a really sophisticated air defense capability that Moscow paid for during the Cold War, so that wasn't smart. Their cyber capabilities are paltry, and they've now revealed that to the world. I mean they're fighting a war with a country they basically hacked their websites like, ""Oh no.""On top of that, you got the fact that they invaded a country the size of Germany and the UK and forgot to supply them with stuff. I just want to tell all your listeners, when you look at a map of Russians invading more and more of Ukraine, just be aware of a very important point, Ukraine has very low population density. When Russians every day conquer greater piece of it, that's actually not a good thing, that's a bad thing because there's nothing to supply them with food and fuel in those areas. They should've grabbed the cities, they didn't, and the reason they didn't grab the cities is because Ukrainians didn't just wait for them at the border and have this coordinated tank battle where they would've lost in 30 minutes, instead they withdrew to the cities, garrisoned them, and are denying Russia the resupply opportunities.Finally, that 40 mile convoy is a huge sign of weakness. The media's talking about it as if shows and illustrates Russian power, but it shows that they're capable of replicating the I-35 traffic jam between Waco and Dallas, except it's less lethal. That's what it tells me. And in fact, it tells every country out there that has look down, shoot down capability on their air force that they can take on 200,000 Russian troops. So yeah, I mean putting it all together, I think there's the debate out there in finance whether the media's narrative that's obviously we're getting a lot of Ukrainian PR, we're getting a lot of Western bias and propaganda, there's this narrative like, ""Oh well, maybe Russians aren't doing so poorly."" No, I can tell you as a professional, they messed this up. Patrick: If we go even before the invasion and think a little bit about the geopolitical motivations for doing this, and I realize this is a hard question, because a lot of the open concerns are, what are Russian objectives? Especially with the difficulty that they've had, what is good, bad, ugly outcome for Russia, geopolitically speaking, not just this saving face nonsense that you hear about, but truly new advantages that Russia as a country, given its objectives, derives from owning the situation in Ukraine? So maybe you could walk us through the original motivations for doing this in the first place as you see them. Marko: So I would say that there is no outcome that's going to be good for Russia. But I would say that one of the things that Russia does want is a neutral Ukraine, a Finlandized Ukraine. That's a term that's been used for a while. Now that is a dirty word in the domestic politics of Ukraine. So in fact, Zelenskyy has abrogated some of the commitments of Kyiv under the Minsk protocols that were negotiated in 2004 and then again in 2015. And he did that because the domestic politics in Ukraine changed over the last eight years. It hardened. There was less room for compromise and obviously the US was writing checks it had no intention of cashing, offering Ukraine all sorts of things that we're now not going to give them, like there is no NATO membership on the table.And so what I think Russia wanted first and foremost is a commitment from Kyiv that they will become Finland. And that was really difficult to accomplish for Zelenskyy and the current government. How do you do that when that's an extremely unpopular view in Ukraine? And I think that the one thing Russia will probably get out of this, perhaps within weeks, if not days, is a commitment from Kyiv that they will be neutral. And it's not that crazy of a commitment by the way, Moldova next door has that in their Constitution, and they've been allowed by Russia to essentially pursue integration economically with Europe. That was the cost of allowing Moldova to have a relatively open relationship with the West. It's a very similar situation. Moldova has the region called Transnistria, there's 1,500 Russian troops there as ""peacekeepers"". And so Moldova chose a different path, not an antagonistic one towards Russia.The second thing is that, yeah, sure, I guess Russia wants demilitarization of Ukraine, but again, your listeners should not be too literal about this. Demilitarization is in the eye of the beholder. When NATO bombed Serbia for three months, it didn't demilitarize anything. There were tank columns coming out of Kosovo for hours and then NATO was like, ""We demilitarized Serbia."" NATO forensic troops went to call, someone found that they hit four tanks, four tanks and like a thousand Yugos with a tree trunk stuck in them. What I'm trying to say is Russia can claim to have demilitarized Ukraine because of weeks of their special operation. So, don't worry about that issue.The final one is obviously Donetsk, Luhansk and Crimea. I think there's no chance that Kyiv agrees to give them up, but at the same time Zelenskyy made a point yesterday, a couple days ago saying like, ""We can make some arrangement with this."" He's basically saying like, ""Relax. We're not going to officially recognize that Russia has these regions, but the de facto outcome is what it is."" Now, does Russia want to carve out a piece of Ukraine, like east of the Dnieper? Does Russia want to annex this, put in a public government? Your listeners can forget about these outcomes. Iraq was 65% Shi'a when Americans invaded. It was ruled by a Sunni dictator, basically a 20% minority. About 80% of the country welcomed American troops in 2003.Taliban is Pashtun. 60% of Afghanistan are not Pashtun. So I'm going to just roughly estimate 60% of Afghanistan welcomed the Americans and the Northern Alliance in 2002. There is nobody welcoming Russia. If they want to annex a part of Ukraine, if they want to leave a puppet government, they better be ready to pay for a 300-400,000 garrison permanently, in discussion. And so I think that we will get a negotiated outcome over the next couple of weeks. I think that the material constraints that are acting on Russia, and that's my framework, that's what I use to make alpha in the market - those constraints are now manifesting themselves. And I think eventually Putin will have to accept the reality and get a negotiated win, raise the mission accomplished banner, and then think about how to live off from there.Because the longer the sting goes on, the more it will incentivize other countries to, quite frankly, be more antagonistic towards Russia. Poland right now is begging for Russia to invade it because not only would it probably win, it would re-invade Russia and take Moscow in a month. I'm being hyperbolic, but nobody's looking at what's going on right now and saying like, ""Oh no, I wish the Russians don't go further."" Patrick: How have your impressions of warfare evolved as a result of watching this? Because something that strikes me as we've gotten so used to, in the modern world, relative lack of visible warfare of this type, where we obviously had the time in the Middle East and there have been episodes of it, but something like this that feels to some people at surface level that it could tip into something as a major global conflict where all sorts of sides get pulled together, you hear World War III as a phrase uttered, which is a bizarre thing to see in the news. But then you see this weird nature of the military conflict, like you said, Russia's doing a very bad job. There's the threat of nukes that obviously is scary and terrifying if you think about it for five minutes. With all of that in mind, has your view of modern warfare changed? What do you think modern warfare really even means given what we've seen in the last couple of weeks here? Marko: I guess on one hand, I think it's interesting that it's not so modern. Drones have not made a big impact in this conflict. They did in the Azerbaijan-Armenia conflict at the end of 2020. Most of us didn't pay attention to it, there were other things going on. Azerbaijan really used drones very, very effectively. That has not been a big deal here. So this war has been actually quite classical, very 1990s, 2000s. Russians seem to have spent very little time studying American offensive operations and that's to their detriment.And the second thing I think is that we're seeing a war that is televised in a way that I think we wouldn't have had it before. So think about 1960s, Russians go in, I guess 50,000 Russians die over the next three months. They level Ukrainian cities, but you don't know how difficult it was for them to have accomplished. And they look like they crushed Ukraine and you are not aware of all the costs that they incurred doing so. And most importantly, Russian citizens would not have been, Soviet citizens would not have been aware of those costs. And so that's where I think the war is really different. It's difficult to abrogate access to the internet and information, especially with things like Starlink running around providing people with access to information, whether they're hooked into the cables in the country or not. People in Russia are sophisticated, they can access through VPN all sorts of channels of information.And all of this is being televised and made very perfectly clear right in front of them. And so I think that there's an element here where the failures of Russia so far - and again, they might win in the end - but the failures are so egregious that if you're sitting in any other country in the world, whether it's Beijing or the US or Iran, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and you're looking at what's going on, I think your lesson from this is not like, ""Oh my God, this is so easy."" I think you're saying like, ""Man, this is really complicated. And not only is it complicated, but the challenges will be televised and reported in TikTok to my millennial and Gen Z citizens who quite frankly, don't give a shit about spheres of influence."" Patrick: What do you think we should discuss about nuclear? It is a scary, terrifying, ever-present concept. Nuclear deterrence has ""worked"" I guess since no one's launched a nuke at each other since World War II, but it's also this sleeping giant of a topic. I realized that I hadn't read about or thought about or considered it in a long, long time since high school or something. So, what is necessary to bring into the discussion around countries that do have access to nuclear weapons and the hammer waiting behind these less effective forces? Marko: The issue with nuclear weapons is that tactical nukes are not very useful in this conflict. So tactical nuclear weapons are really designed to break large columns of tanks advancing on a fortified position. So if Ukraine had tactical nukes, it wouldn't be useful. What's Russia going to use tactical nukes for? There is absolutely no theater of war they have right now to use them, this low yield tactical nuke. Ukrainians did a really smart thing, they withdrew to the cities at a cost of civilian casualties, but they did that smartly. What are we saying? Russia's going to nuke Ukrainian cities? I see no chance of that happening. That's the debate of tactical nukes I've heard a lot in finance. A lot of folks are talking about it. It just doesn't fit this theater of war.In fact, Soviet Union had a no-first-use policy, and that was because they had the columns of tanks. NATO and America didn't have no first use because they would've used tactical nukes against Soviet tank columns, which is something to keep in mind. There is still deterrence. That's the reason why Russia is currently invading one of the most difficult countries to invade in history of mankind, given size, capability of military, veterans fighting for the last eight years, blah, blah, blah, all these reasons. They're doing that instead of invading Estonia, which presumably would've been much easier. And that's also a really good point, is Putin irrational? Has he lost his mind? Well, he didn't invade a NATO member state, article five, nuclear weapon deterrent, those are all the reasons why you wouldn't want to do that, but he could have. He could have invaded other countries in the periphery former Soviet space, he chose the one that is not a member of NATO. Patrick: What is the difference between tactical nukes and whatever non-tactical or other categories of nukes are? What is the taxonomy that we should be familiar with? Marko: Ability to deploy in a theater of war, and yield. A tactical nuke is tactical because you can use it in a theater of war to accomplish a tactical objective, such as stopping a column of tanks coming towards a specific area. Strategic nuclear weapon, it's like using a hammer. You wouldn't use it in a theater of war, it's designed for deterrence and it's designed to kill off millions of civilians. Patrick: It's much more of an actual battlefield weapon versus a apocalyptic weapon? Yeah. Marko: Yeah. You could use a field artillery to launch that nuclear weapon.",3401
186,Marko Papic - A Multi-Polar World,Sanctions and Economic Warfare as a Deterrent," Patrick: If we're bringing this forward to the present, the other thing that's happened that I'm fascinated to get your take on is just the voluntary, I guess I'll call it, economic warfare that's happened from Western corporations, shutting down services, cutting off access points to Russia writ large, which to me feels scary, complicated, interesting in a bad way. And I'm just curious how this has landed on you. So I think Visa and MasterCard was the one that everyone started really paying attention, but it's become this huge momentum play for all the major Western corporations to say they're not buying from Russia or they're not operating in Russia or they're no longer selling in Russia or whatever the thing might be. What's the impact of all this? Do you think this lasts? Do you think if this thing in the Ukraine ends, this all gets unwound? What are the longer-term implications of this voluntary economic participation against a country? Marko: That's a really crucial question, Patrick, because it's also going to determine whether we have much more macro volatility going forward because there is a scenario where I'm right, and it's a low conviction view obviously - Putin has already gone through his material constraints. So he could just double down and triple down on this conflict, and it lasts forever.But let's say I'm right, let's say that in three, two weeks we get some sort of a ceasefire and agreement and he gets to put up a mission accomplished banner. And then you've got two problems. One, political pressure may remain, especially with the Biden administration where the costs of being mean to Russia are nonexistent. Okay? America can do whatever it wants when it comes to Russia, it can write checks to Ukraine it doesn't intend to cash. As I said, to promise them things, it can be mean to Russia, it can sanction the central bank. Consequences to America are nonexistent because ultimately, US and Russia have pretty much no trade. I think the political pressure on Biden will be very tough and he will continue to do so. That will irk Moscow because Moscow will feel that it had basically dampened tensions. And so I can see Russia retaliating against the west if those sanctions are not removed. Now, how does it retaliate? Several ways. Russia basically exports 43 percent of world supply of palladium, 17 percent natural gas, 16 percent potash, platinum is at 12, crude is at 12, wheat is at 11, gold is nine and so on. And some of these don't really bring in that much revenue. Palladium is only about 3 billion dollars if it were to stop exporting for six months, but it is a critical supply chain input.So Russia could choose something like palladium or potash, which Russia and Belarus by the way together are 40 percent of global supply. If there was a self-embargo on potash, food prices are going to go through the roof and there'll be mass starvation in many countries, less developed countries, not the US. But my point is that there are ways that Russia could impose a self-embargo that would be really meaningful for the global economy. Now energy is another one of those. And that's what I'm really worried about. I'm worried about this world where the US doesn't remove some of the toughest sanctions against banks or central bank and Russia retaliates through the energy export. We did some scenario analysis and basically if Russia worked to curtail its exports by a quarter, it still makes money, at 120, 150, 200 bucks. It makes money at every one of those price points. It will add revenue.It will replace lost volumes with higher prices. If it were to curtail oil exports by 50 percent, it would lose money at 120 bucks. But there's no way that Brent would stay at 120 bucks if Russia cut off half of its exports. So at 150, its revenue is stable, at 200 it's making money. So there's this danger that they could actually do that, and that would obviously be very bad for the global economy. Doubling oil prices and yield curve inversion tends to basically tell you there's a recession coming in 12 months, no matter what the current conditions are. Now, your point is a little bit different. You're asking what's the consequence of voluntary companies, basically responding to kind of an ESG angle here. And again, that just doubles down on my point because that's even worse, because there's no way for western governments to force Shell or Starbucks back into Russia.Russia may go down a rabbit hole of abrogating capitalists. They said today, there's going to start nationalizing factories that westerners have left idle. There could be a complete abrogation of trade between the two countries. And in that case, I think it increases probability that Russia retaliates. Even though it's not something that was state-driven, it's an organic response of corporates to Russian aggression in Ukraine. But Russia would then retaliate to that with a state-sponsored response through the energy or commodity channel. Patrick: Do you think that all this is some first sign that the world is just deglobalizing? I've talked with Peter Zeihan about this a lot where we've all come to experience this state of global trade, global peace, relatively low amounts of warfare, et cetera, a lot of interconnectedness in global markets, whether they be commodity or some other markets. What is your prediction there? What do you think this tells us about the future of globalization and just the general interconnected nature of countries? Marko: My thesis since 2013 has been that we are at the apex of globalization, and it's all downhill from here. And the reason for that is not Trump, it's not Brexit, it's not anti-establishment, it's not mean Vladimir Putin or anyone else. The reason for that is that we're in a multipolar world and multipolarity is this term from political science that describes a world where multiple countries pursue their foreign policy interests independent or not. Therefore it's very different from a unipolar system where America tells you what you need to do or where the United Kingdom tells you what you need to do. That's a very conducive world for globalization. Just one bully, everyone gets smacked around and told how to basically conduct. That's great. Everybody can then adopt the same rules and norms and trade. And it's also different from a bipolar world where you have two bullies like Soviet Union and US, and they create these two camps that don't talk to one another. A multipolar world is a messy world and it's going to have less efficiency.It's not going to be deglobalized. Deglobalization is actually not empirically proven. We haven't deglobalized. In fact, global trade is coming back up since COVID. It's just less efficient. And what I mean by that is that in a multipolar world, a couple of things happen. First of all, there's obviously not an overarching set of rules and norms. So it's difficult to have efficiency in terms of trade and investment. Second, you start getting spheres of influence. And that's what Russia's protecting in Ukraine as an example. But spheres of influence, when the world gets carved up into Chinese, Turkish, European, American, Russian, Indian sphere of influence - what that means for an investor or CEO listening to this - what it means is that there is no longer a global market for stuff. And that means that supply is constricted. Supply of what? Supply of everything. Suddenly the cobalt in the Congo is not up for the highest bidder. Parts of that cobalt, which is necessary for a green transition, is going to have to go to the Congo's geopolitical boss, which is China. And suddenly you've taken that supply off the global market.So this outcome is inflationary and it's less efficient. There's still trade. And the irony of the multipolar world though, is that the trade between enemies actually goes up. It doesn't go down. And that's because coordination amongst allies is very difficult. And you're seeing that right now, because I think that the consequence of this conflict in Ukraine is not like a united west. It will be actually a disunited west. I think Europe is going to learn from this crisis, blame the US for what happened. You just wait. Right now, everyone's blaming Putin. After all, he is the one that crossed the borders. But six months from now, when Europe takes a couple of cold showers, you're going to look back in the last couple years and say, wait a minute, why were Americans promising Ukraine all this stuff, that embolden Kyiv to stand up to Russia instead of forcing Kyiv to sit down to the negotiating table with Moscow and create a stable equilibrium that will prevent the war.And so that is the kind of a multipolar environment where there's less efficiency, it's more inflationary, and also it's going to be a very complicated world in which we're going to have a higher frequency of geopolitical risks and events as political science theory basically tells us multipolar world leads to.",1943
187,Marko Papic - A Multi-Polar World,Inflation and the Shifting Role of the Fed," Patrick: Obviously we have talked about inflation, you brought it up there. Now's probably a good time. If we had been talking, you and I, four weeks ago or something, almost certainly our whole conversation might have been around what's going on with inflation? What's the Fed's role? Are there historical analogs for this? How should we view this episode of sort of post COVID inflation? So I'll ask that same question and obviously the geopolitical stuff will factor into it, I'm sure. But what is your view of inflation? Not just globally, but maybe more specifically for the US. Marko: So I had a framework before the pandemic of what was going to happen with the next recession. And that at framework, I described it in my book, Geopolitical Alpha, but basically my framework was look, policy makers are not going to allow us to have a deep recession. So next recession that we have, which will probably be shallow, you'll see a policy response they will dwarf 2008, 2009. So when the pandemic actually happened, I was like, oh my God, this isn't a shallow recession, this going to be deep, so they're going to go crazy. And this is going to be the most extraordinary stimulus. So that helped me one, find the bottom in 2020, but two, it also made me an inflationista, which I've never been in my life. I've generally accepted the structural deflationary forces in the world. But the policy response combined with less globalization, not no globalization, just less, apex of it. And combined with the geopolitical environment of a multipolar world, put me into the inflation camp.I wasn't surprised by us hitting seven and a half percent on the CPI. Most importantly, I wasn't surprised that the US inflation actually outperformed almost anybody else's inflationary outcomes because we actually stimulate more than anyone else. But at the same time, this year, there's a second derivative effect. A lot of these things had happened and so I was in the camp that inflation would peak and go down. Now, go down where? I don't know, I'm not really good at math. So I'm just going to throw a dart, say maybe three to five percent, I don't know. I know you can drive an aircraft carrier through those two assumptions, but whatever. The point was inflation would peak by the end of the year. And the Fed, in my view, would call that a victory.So eight rate hikes is nonsense. They would call peaking of inflation and its asymptotic approach to their math. They would make up something fancy like that. They would've called that a victory and kind of backed off. Now I think we're in a world where that might not happen. So if you look at different oil price scenarios, there's a world where we end at between six and nine percent this year, if this is like the Yom Kippur War of 1973. And that's a really good analog to kind of just spend some time thinking about. Patrick: Yeah. Can you describe that? I don't know that well. Marko: Well, first of all, very similar setup historically. Late sixties, an era of profligacy. America basically had Vietnam War, also LBJ's great society. Inflation and pressures were building up and then in 1971 Nixon resolved the trade war that was going to happen. And he also resolved the de-pegging of the dollar through the Smithsonian agreement, which depreciated and devalued the dollar. And from 71 to 73, you had this increase in, basically, prices of everything. It started bubbling up. So Yom Kippur War starts in 1973, the OPEC imposes a self-embargo. So OPEC imposes an embargo because Americans were helping Israel in the war against various Arab states. That was what the war was about. OPEC controlled by Arab petrol producing states basically imposes an embargo. And that was what I'm calling an inflation cherry on an inflationary sundae. We were already in inflation. The Fed had been raising rates from 72 to 73.And then when that happened, boom, we had a recession 73 to 75. The Fed responds, obviously with more hikes, then later it cuts as the recession comes in. And my fear is that we're repeating the same story this time, where again, it's not like this war is the reason we have 7.5 percent CPI, it has nothing to do with it. But then it prevents it from coming down. It prevents the Fed from declaring victory and mission accomplished just because of the trajectory. That is the macro consequence that this event could have. I do think there's differences between today and 1973. So it's not as easy as 1973, but 1973, let me just tell you one other thing that happened then. It was a really bad recession and it was a really bad recession for the market. The yield curve inverted in February of 1973. And it's the only time that the yield curve inverted and we didn't reach all time highs, subsequently.So usually when the yield curve inverts, yes, it tells you that 12 months later there's going to be trouble, potentially a recession. It basically tells you the Fed's going to have to cut because they made a policy error. That's what the yield curve inversion, the simple explanation is that's what it means. Normally you do get an all time high in stocks, except in 1973. And I got to give a shoutout to my friend Anastasio [inaudible], he's a chief strategist at the firm called [inaudible] Capital, who gave me that insight. So I don't want to just steal his insight there. So what does it mean for us today? It means that if this inflation goes high, if the Fed responds to it, we're not even going to have from this point our blow off rally at the end of the cycle. We're just going to go now. It's just going to be super bearish. If 1973 repeats itself exactly the same, sell everything right now, buy gold, hide somewhere. Except that I do think we're in a different world.I think we're in a world where the Fed is scared. I think the elites in America, in general, just are scared of what is the consequence of the next recession. And so I think actually the Fed, not right away, but I think eventually by the end of the year, we'll create a narrative that this is an exogenous shock, it's geopolitical and that it can be looked through. What does that mean though? That means that we could end the year with six to nine percent CPI, with the Fed basically saying, nah, it's cool. It's transitory! And I mean, that's a world where the real yields in the US go deeply negative and you probably have to stay in equities. Inflation proof equities, obviously healthcare, maybe real estate and materials, definitely energy, definitely commodities. Definitely commodities. And Gold. Patrick: If you think about the role of the Fed, how has it evolved? And in your mind, what is it? It gets invoked a lot. One of my favorite investors to study is Stan Druckenmiller, who I think boils everything down to liquidity and is a very careful Fed watcher. Obviously an incredibly successful investor. Why the linkage between the investing world and the Fed in the first place? Why is it so inextricable? What is the Fed's role in your mind? I know it's a big topic, but it just does seem to be this massive gravitational force in capital markets that's frankly hard to understand and hard to predict. How do you think about it and interpret it and it's role today? Marko: I definitely fall on the side that, look, the Fed controls liquidity. Dollar liquidity, which is probably the most important macro variable out there. So that's the first issue, and also financial conditions. But I think that the reason we're focused on the Fed so much is also because we as an epistemic community, as a community of financial professionals, of investors, we have grown up over the last 40 years. Very few of us have traded before 1980. So we have existed in this world since 1980 that had certain features to it. One, laissez-faire capitalism became the dominant ideological position. And that means the state should withdraw itself from all facets of life. The state should be small enough that you can drown it in a bathtub, as the adage goes. So that was the first issue. You didn't have to worry about so much. There was a deregulatory push, the state was shrinking. So you don't have to worry about politics, domestic politics.Second, America basically started winning the Cold War from 1985 onwards. It was a fait accompli. So you didn't have to worry about geopolitics because if any country was a rogue pariah state, boom, it was on CNN from a video camera in a town hall. That's what the world was, geopolitical unipolar moment of America. And then finally in that world where geopolitics and politics doesn't matter, what does matter? Well what matters is monetary policy. So for 40 years, the only thing that was a catalyst for markets was central bank decision making, their policy and arbitrage between different monetary policies. Like, oh, look at this Norwegian central bank is going to be a little bit hawkish, but Swedish is dovish. Boom. I've got a trade off. That's it. That's all we have to do.Now, I still respect monetary policy. Don't get me wrong Patrick, just because I'm more on the geopolitical macro side doesn't mean that I think geopolitical events are more important than the Fed. I just think that today it gets a little bit more complicated. You have to put everything that's happening into its macro context, but you also have to worry about some idiosyncratic stuff you didn't have to worry about many years ago. Now, if the Fed responds to a war in Russia and Ukraine with a March 23rd, 2020 style stimulus, baby, I'm calling the bottom and I buying everything there is. Of course. But they're not going to do that given the context we're in. And so then suddenly Ukraine, Russia does matter. Patrick: How do you think about the impact of liquidity on asset prices? So again, liquidity is another one of these squishy terms that I think we all think we know what it means. What do you think it actually means? Why is liquidity such a key factor in markets? Marko: I mean, I got a chart for you I'm staring at right now. Very simple, global central bank total assets and MSCI world total returns. Looks pretty correlated to me. I think that's just a way to think about it. I mean, what central banks have been able to do through QE and various forms of QE over the past decade and a half is just push investors further and further through the risk curve. That's a standard explanation. I don't think I'm giving you anything profound, but I think it does really make sense. And when they start to withdraw that, I think that's when you see real underperformance in risk assets, it is kind of that simple.",2444
188,Marko Papic - A Multi-Polar World,China's Place on the Global Stage," Patrick: Can we talk about China specifically and how you view its role on the global stage? I remember reading A Hundred Year Marathon, that great book about their incredibly long duration planning and ambitions as a sort of global hegemon or something. One of these multipolar powers, series of influence, whatever you want to call it. What is your view of their plan, their strategy, their current positioning and strength, the way that this thing in Ukraine may alter their strategy going forward? Just walk us through your sort of model of China as a global player. Marko: Okay. So I'm going to start off with a 30,000 foot view and then go down. I'm in a camp, which is a very small camp. In fact, I may be the only guy in the world that thinks that China has peaked. It doesn't mean that it's going to go downhill. I just think that this is it. This is where China is. And it's peaked for three reasons. First and foremost, it's not really energy independent. It depends on global access to energy. And most of that energy comes through ships, not pipelines. And that's a real vulnerability for China because it doesn't have the Navy to project power. It has a Navy to deny access. So lots of frigates, lots of submarines, lots of things that can blow up other people's ships, but it doesn't have the ability to show up outside of the Strait of Hormuz and say, yo, what's up? We're getting that barrel of oil out of Saudi Arabia. Don't you touch it.And it's going to take you a decade to build that navy. Not like, oh my God, they built some aircraft carriers. Cool. They need a decade to match where the US is. So that's the first issue. And I think that they're actually quite intelligent about this and that they realize that trying to compete with America in naval competition would end China. So instead they're pivoting to EVs and green technology. That's their way to solve this problem. It's a national security prerogative for China to boost their ability to lower consumption of oil, but that's going to take a decade. So that's the first issue. The second issue is much more profound of a problem, and it's the fact that they've fallen into the middle-income trap. The middle-income trap basically is something that very few emerging market economies have escaped.So in the mid-2010s, I think in 2012, China produced this report with the World Bank. It was actually Liu He's effort to produce it, and it talked about developing emerging markets. It shows that out of a hundred plus merchant markets only 14 escaped the middle-income trap. The middle-income trap is basically being stuck between 30 and like 60% of US GDP per capita. And so when your GDP per capita just doesn't grow anymore because of inefficiencies, primarily because your productivity slows down as you move from manufacturing to services. And Chinese policymakers were completely obsessed about this topic, for good reason. Getting stuck in the middle-income trap is usually a bad thing for political outcomes, but they've gotten stuck in it. They are stuck there, and that's because labor force growth is basically going to zero, if not negative. And their productivity, I suspect, is much lower than what the published figures are. So the reason that matters is because once you get stuck there, you need to start balancing your economy towards things that work in order for you to have any growth. And what works in China is exports and state-led initiatives, investments.So I actually think that everyone out there who expects the household sector in China domestic consumption to save this economy is completely wrong. Household debt in China, as percent of disposable income, is higher than the US. It's higher than the US. And you know why Patrick? Because they spent the last decade leveraging up their households in the private sector because we took a vacation from spending. That was a secular stagnation. We were de-leveraging in the West. Households in the West were de-leveraging and didn't buy anything. So China had to leverage.But that means that China is right now in 2006 if they're lucky, 2007 if they're unlucky. And they're looking at a period of a decade where they de-leverage. So why is that a geopolitical issue? It's a geopolitical issue because it's a fantasy that China will somehow pivot to domestic demand and become independent and sovereign. No, no, no, they're going to depend on you and me clicking buy on Amazon for a long time. And if you are dependent on Patrick and Marco buying stuff from you, you probably don't want to invade countries around you.The third issue is demographic. Now, most people focus on demographics, terrible demographics in China. Like, oh my God, that's a growth problem. Man, whatever, sure. To me, it's a different issue. If China's going to have to continue to invest at a high level, its only avenues to growth are exports and investment. Well, what do you need in order to invest at a high level? You need a high level of savings. Well, okay. God bless, China has high savings, right? Maybe not for long. An aging society is a society of consumers, not savers. Old people don't save, they spend what they save. As China transitions to an older society, its savings rate will drop below their investment rate. And that's why demographic trap is critical to their current account.The current account of China will, I think, dip into negative territory, not anytime soon, but by the end of this decade, I think it will. It flirted with negative current account deficit in I think 2018. Now they avoided it. How did Japan avoid dropping into a negative current account? Well, because it dropped its investment level. Investment as percentage of GDP in Japan has dropped massively over the last 40 years as its society aged. But Japan also ended up escaping the middle-income trap, so they could afford to drop their investments. China won't be able to do that.What's my conclusion here? The three traps of China, one, it won't become energy efficient for the next decade. Two, over the next decade it's going to have to double down on exports and investment. And three, it's going to have to eventually depend on investors listening to this conversation giving them money. A country that's not energy independent, that depends on exports and manufacturing growth, and depends on foreign capital is not a country that invades or is aggressive geopolitically. It's a country that's actually quite pacified. They're still going to be a power and they're still going to be a rival of the US, but I actually think that they are quite trapped.And I wrote that that's my thesis from last year. Now, if China's observing what's going the Ukraine, what are the lessons they're getting from us? I hear a lot of mostly politically ideological commentary like, ""Oh, Biden's weak, blah, blah, blah."" Whether I agree with that, who cares? The point is like, nothing that's happening in Ukraine looks great for Beijing, which is probably why it's a great move if they did tell Putin they were okay with him invading Ukraine, because, hey, they get to see what it looks like. What happens? What are the consequences? What's the West's response? It's like two kids standing at a cliff going to jump into a cold lake, and one kid says to the other one, ""I'm right behind you, bro. Just go ahead."" And then when the other one jumps, it's like, ""Hey, are there any rocks down there? Are you okay?"" Patrick: I think you kind of answered the question, but I want to make sure I'm thorough. It stands to reason then that an invasion of Taiwan or something like that you think is a low probability event. But I would love to just hear what your thoughts are about Taiwan. It seems to be such a fascinating geopolitical space to me because if it wasn't for Taiwan Semiconductor and some critical assets there, maybe the balance is very different. What is your impression of something like that existing, and do you think that will go away? It seems like the West is woken up to points of failure in supply chain during COVID and maybe other things. Commodities now, today, and that the world will reshape itself around this multi-polarity you talked about and have like different spheres of supply chain and not be relying on these places. Do you think that that's true, and is Taiwan a good example of that? Marko: I think it's very true. You know, in that world, Patrick, that you described, like Taiwan's actual geopolitical relevance to the rest of the world will decline. Because there's now this huge push, which by the way, is inflationary, at least in the initial phase, there's this huge push which I call the national security redundancy prerogative. If you think about why we have persistently high inflation and why this is not demand driven and it's not transitory, just like really three reasons. There's the multipolar de-globalization point or apex globalization, there's spheres of influence, the green transition, and then the national security redundancy prerogative. Eventually that redundancy prerogative will mean that France will build its own semiconductors. That's the world in which maybe Taiwan actually gets less geopolitical relevant. I think this will continue to be the number one geopolitical risk.And the question to me is like, how willing is China to incur considerable costs if it were to try to militarily reunify with its province of Taiwan. I think that's the question. And I think that what they're observing right now is how committed the West is to punishing its rivals. You've seen the use of central bank sanctions, which I think nobody expected. I didn't expect it. Honestly, I haven't talked to a single person that did - that was kind of a nuclear option. There was always this view that, ""Oh, you can't mess with currency reserves because then the other country will sell them."" And the West is just like, ""Whatever, sell them. We got QE, bro. Like, we'll buy it. Don't worry about it. We're good."" So, that's the first issue.The second issue, I think they're seeing the point that you raise, which is this ESG component to the sanctions where companies are openly removing themselves from the country. And finally, you see the fact that this could get messy, that countries do fight back. Even in 2022, they're willing to die for freedom. Those are, I think, things that are real constraints to attacking Taiwan. In addition to the points I've raised in terms of China being still dependent on exports, soon to be dependent on foreign capital. I think those are going to keep this issue simmering, but not exploding. Then again, of course the argument against that is a more emotional one, ideological one, that president Xi Jinping, he has his legacy and so on, and I respect those views. But all I would say about that is this.Let's step back and think about China for a second. What do we know about the Chinese Communist Party? We know that it has survived as the legitimate ruler of China without having had to reunify with the province of Taiwan. In other words, that's a fact. We know that China's Communist Party rules China, and Taiwan is a wayward province that is kind of in this nebulous situation. But what we don't know is what would happen to the Chinese Communist Party if it didn't deliver the Chinese dream to the median Chinese citizen? That is a much greater risk, and I still fall into the camp that believes that the number one priority to any Chinese leader is to ensure the steady progress towards some form of a Chinese dream, a moderately prosperous society. Patrick: I think it's a fascinating read. And I'm curious why you think your camp is so small? Like if you're the only occupant of this kind of China has peaked camp, why is that a small camp? Like why don't more people think this way? Seems logical enough. Marko: There's I think three camps. There's the China will blow up camp, because of real estate. I mean, hell, there's a lot of people in that camp and have been for the past 20 years, and they've been wrong. Then there's a camp that look, China's a huge rival, and America has to spend all this time and effort, and has to become something other than America to face. And that's a growing camp for a couple of reasons. First it's just really appealing to linearly extrapolate and linearly forecast geopolitics. That camp probably included a bunch of people who thought we'd be speaking Japanese today. You know, the Blade Runner movie, the original one, noodle houses in LA. It's hilarious, I love that scene.So there's linear extrapolation. There's also a lot of vested interests. There are vested interests in having a common enemy. One, it could solve polarization here domestically, but also like there's a lot of money to be made if there is somebody that you can kind of build weapons against, and create software that protects you against and so on. So there's a whole cottage industry right now in the US projecting China into some sort of a behemoth that will dominate east Asia. The camp I inhabit is one that's kind of between the two, like China will remain a rival. It has its own interests and it will pursue them. It's not going to be America's friend. Countries don't have friends or enemies. They have interests or pursue those interests. But at the same time, it's much more dependent on the rest of the world and its demand.Then people think... See Russia is different. Russia sells stuff that we can't deny buying. It's very difficult to say no to Russian stuff. China sells mostly t-shirts, toaster ovens, and toys. We can say no to that, and it won't be that painful. And also on top of that, if they do tip into a current account deficit... with Russia, Russia has a huge current account surplus because of its exports of energy, and it doesn't buy anything. If China were to tip into a current account deficit, well that means that suddenly it will care what pension funds in America think about it, because someone has to finance that current account.And then it comes down to, what do you think? What do I think, what do the people listening to this think? What is the number one prerogative for Chinese leaders? Look, if it's reunifying with Taiwan then they'll do it in the next five years, I'll be wrong. If it's to ensure that the median citizen in China continues to see development, then I don't think they will. By the way that goes also to Russia.One of the things that I think we're missing here in this whole story is that a lot of people think that voters don't matter in authoritarian regimes, that somehow dictators just don't care what their population think. I think that's completely wrong. I think the Chinese focus on internet security and just social media in their country. It's not about suppressing thought. It's about basically having a constant feedback of what the population wants. If you look at what Xi Jinping has done since he came to power, it's been just a slew of highly popular policies. I mean the common prosperity theme is just the latest one. Incremental quantity became a buzzword on social media before Chinese policymakers acted on it. A good friend, Zak Dychtwald, who wrote Young China, told me that before common prosperity started. That's a great book by the way, Young China, whoever wants to read it.But in Russia, it's kind of the same. Russia has a history of massive revolutions, especially after failed offensive military operations by the way, as a side point, which might be relevant for today. And the reason Russians have not revolted against the United Russia regime of Vladimir Putin is because he delivered to them something that they wanted, which is stability after the disastrous 1990s. And when I see these ATM lines in McDonald's in Russia, and when I see what's happening right now, I think that there's a real risk that we have dramatic domestic political upheaval in Russia because the social contract between Vladimir Putin and the people is starting to break down. He was supposed to bring stability, geopolitically and economically, not the chaos that's now happening because of the sanctions in the war in Ukraine.",3575
189,Marko Papic - A Multi-Polar World,Examining America's Ability to Project Power," Patrick: I'd love to hear you apply this treatment to the United States. We haven't actually talked much about other than maybe the fed a bit and inflation about the US specifically. We came across last week this really compelling idea, at an interesting dinner where China was kind of the topic, that the exports of the US predominantly are its military power, its culture, and business with the focus on finance and technology within business. And that those three things together sort of define our role in the world and have defined our role in the world in obviously an amazing way if you're an American, like it's been a great place to live. I believe deeply in the American system, but what is your take if you're just an impartial judge giving the same sort of treatment of what's going on that matters in the US in the same way that you've done for us, for China and Russia? Marko: I mean, definitely income inequality. That is the number one issue that I think is motivating policymakers right now. And again, I describe that as the Buenos Aires consensus. So we've lived under something called the Washington consensus for the past 40 years. Washington consensus is a set of best practices we learned in the '80s: orthodox monetary policy, countercyclical fiscal policy, free trade deregulation, privatization, laissez-faire capitalism. I think that what's happening, because of the secular stagnation cycle of the past decade, I think that we are moving away from that Washington consensus, and those best practices are something that's basically the opposite of that. So instead of cyclical fiscal policy, we have a profligate fiscal policy. You have a recession, you blow out your budget deficit like massively, to the point where we spent more money fighting the pandemic recession than the last five recessions and their fiscal responses. Five. And one of those was the great financial crisis, for God's sake, which was extremely deep.Second is instead of orthodox monetary policy, you have very unorthodox monetary policy. Even now after the June 2021 Fed pivot, everybody talks about the June 2021 Fed pivot, like Patrick, have you raised rates? Is the fed still buying? It's not that hawkish, right? And then of course, free trade. We see what's happening with free trade. Democrats and Republicans are falling over each other to prove to the median voter in America who's less free trade. And then you have things like re-regulation, Lisa Kahn being appointed. The fact that in the US, you do have more regulatory oversight now, and I think you'll have even more. All of these things tell me that we're in a different consensus, not in a Washington one. I've named it Buenos Aires consensus because I like to punch people in the face. I don't actually mean we're going to become Argentina. I don't. But I think it's a good moniker.But the point of all this is that I think that's motivating everything to the US. I think Republicans struggle to be fiscal conservatives. I recently had a conversation with one of the Senate candidates in the Republican party in the upcoming election. People saying like, ""Look, I'm a fiscal conservative, but whoa, whoa, whoa. I want to expand Medicare."" And I'm like, ""Okay, that's interesting."" It's difficult for even Republicans to now run as a fiscal conservative. It's like this guy was being attacked by his Republican primary candidates as being a fiscal conservative.There's a completely different world in the US, and I think it is motivating this cycle. That's what gave us this manic cycle. What gave us this manic bull market, and what will probably give us higher inflation than we expect. A lot of the long term inflation indicators, if you look at them, like five year, five year forward, I think it's at like 2.6%. In the UK it's blown up. In the US it is still anchored, and I think that's because the median investor doesn't realize that the median American is essentially a socialist, whether they're Republican or Democrat by the way. I'm talking about their economic preferences are for the government to have a greater role, are for less orthodox fiscal or monetary policy. And that's a huge mismatch in the market where the long term inflation expectations are pretty well anchored, whereas the actual politics in the country are focused on solving income inequality, however it's done. It's probably going to be done in a poor way, though. It's probably going to be done through inflation, which obviously impoverishes everyone, not through like coherent, we all get together, we say what matters, maybe education, maybe healthcare, okay, let's spend more on that and tax it. That would be a coherent way to solve it. Patrick: What do you think the US could do to improve its lot as a country most? What would be the actions, policy or otherwise that would get you most excited about economic prospect for equity returns? Like all the kind of things that I think people want, GDP growth, per capita growth, maybe even the shrinking of the inequality. What are things that you think are potentially great for the country going forward? Marko: Well, here's what I would say, Patrick. I have a policy of not using the word should. I swear a lot of podcasts, but if I use that, like that would be a swear word. Patrick: Fair enough. Marko: And that's because I bathed myself with basically aloof indifference. And the reason for that is I can't forecast politics if I have a horse in the race, but since you ask me and you've got hundreds of thousands of listeners, here's what I'm going to say. I'll say this. When I look at the US, I think a big problem in the US is its two party system. My solution is basically a fantasy. It will never happen. But I think that actually the European model of democracy is superior in one way, in that it forces parties to work together more often. So, pluralism is not something to be afraid of. Pluralism is not something to be afraid of because then everybody gets to express their voice. It might be a small party that gets 10% of voters who are represented by 10%, but they get to participate maybe in coalition building or something like that. What is happening in the US is that the two parties are getting captured because of the primary system of electing candidates. By the way, nobody really votes in primaries, especially in an off election. So you're going to have all sorts of nut cases on both sides of the aisle get elected, and then they get to deliberate.Here's an interesting thing. Where is the median American? The median American is actually a centrist. If you put together independent voters who identify as independent, if you put together liberal Republicans and conservative Democrats, if you put all of them together, they've gone from 60% of the American electorate to 55. That's a collapse over the last 20 years. Most Americans are exactly where they're were, it's just that the representation of them is being squeezed out by the extremes. I think the only way to really fix that would be a traumatic electoral reform, which is not going to happen, which is why we're not going to fix these issues. We're going to have inflation. And then we're going to kind of come to our senses, I think on the tail end of this and we're going to have a repeat of the '80s.I think the other thing that's working for the US is that in a multipolar world, I think America's going to realize that there are dangers out there. And I think maybe that will help solve polarization to some extent, having external enemies again. Patrick: What topics that we haven't talked about are critical in the world today? You mentioned food and weed prices very briefly. That's one that seems scary. Food is one potential topic, but another topic could be a country like Iran or Turkey or something else. In the stack rankings of important topics today, what are the next few down that we haven't touched on in your mind? Marko: I think the green energy transition is critical to having a macro view. I've done a lot of research on this. We at Clocktower, we're very excited about that as an investment opportunity and it will have costs. It will have costs and we're seeing them right now. So I think about how does politics evolve around the green energy transition? Will there be a pushback against it? Will countries adopt carbon pricing as Europe has done, even in the face of geopolitical problems that maybe make that a difficult and expensive choice?Also, who are going to be the winners and losers of this epic, epic technological transition? I fear that here the US could fall behind. The US because of its politics is most likely to move away from the green energy transition. Europe has decided to pose massive costs on itself in order to get out of it. It has been doing that for the last decade. So if you look at electricity prices and energy prices in Europe versus US, the European energy prices have been extremely high relative to the US. Both because US adopted natural gas and shale, and also because Germany shut down its nuclear power plants in 2011, after Fukushima .Here's an interesting thing. German trade balance against the US hasn't shrunk because of that. So I hear a lot of American bravado out there like, ""Our industrial capacity will win."" It's like, well, it hasn't been winning. It's been losing, America's share of global trade is falling, Germany is keeping it pretty up. Even with its high energy prices. That means its productivity is going through the freaking roof. So not only is Europe remaining competitive on industrial exports, it's also incurring the costs necessary for technological breakouts in this new sphere.So I think, Patrick, what's happening right now is that we've been obsessed with SaaS businesses, software. Peter Thiel has had this thesis of bits versus atoms. We've been obsessed with bits, basically with software and we've put massive amounts of VC capital and private capital into that world. And I think that the future could be very much a future of technological innovation in the realm of atoms, industrials, materials, energy, agriculture, synthetic biology, all that stuff. And it's not clear to me that the US is going to be on the forefront of the next 10 years of that innovation. It's not clear to me that Silicon Valley is going to have a stranglehold on a green technology revolution. Now, this isn't some sort of climate change talk or something like that. I just think that we are at a point where we're going to spend so much money, so much government money on solving climate change, that even if you are in the camp that believes it's a hoax perpetrated by globalist elites to make us all buy electric vehicles, but you're an investor, you would be stupid not to be invested in this.The amount of technological innovation that will come out of this endeavor is going to be massive. It's like the moonshot, the moonshot by itself was stupid. Going to the moon was idiotic. We went there in the seventies, we kicked around some dirt, we never went back. We never went back! Because it was completely idiotic, except that the technological innovation that came out of that effort is the reason you and I can have this conversation. I'm in Santa Monica, you're not, and we're having this conversation because of the moonshot. And that's why I'm saying to people, whether you think the green energy transition is a good thing or a bad thing, that's cool. That's your opinion. But it's happening. And the technological innovation that comes out of it will be absolutely epochal. Patrick: Why would the US not dominate that given our track record of bottom up innovation? Especially in atoms, not just bits, historically has been so strong. What are the preconditions for doing well in atoms based innovation? Marko: Well, I think having a robust and prosperous industrial manufacturing capacity is important, and a lot of that has eroded in the US. So that would be the first thing. The second thing would be having VC money that's interested in that. America has the best venture capital industry in the world by far, but it's gone from like 95% of all dollars were American and went to America about 10 years ago in VC, it's down to 50% now. So that's the other thing. And the third is that I worry about politics in the US more than Europe. Europe is completely committed to this. Now there's some voices talking about how the costs are too much, but Europe will just spend money to make it happen. The other thing is that Europeans are now looking to impose a green tax, which is kind of a liberal version of Trump's protectionism on the border in order to pay for the carbon offsets, and they're much more committed.So those are the reasons why, for example, Europe could actually take the lead of this innovation. If I was to advise an investor on how to pursue this, I would just say, ""Keep your eye on Europe, but certainly invest in America's green technology revolution, which is happening as well. There's plenty of companies here that are going to do great."" I'm just saying that it's not as clear to me that the US will dominate this next chapter of innovation as it did software. Software, look, only two countries have had the web 2.0 revolution, and probably will have 3.0. There's only two. There's America and China. That's it. The end of the story. Everybody else failed. Japan didn't do anything. Europe has Spotify. Yay, great. Russia, no. Everybody missed software, but I'm not sure that's going to be the same case with green technology. And broadly defined. I'm not just talking about solar power and wind. Patrick: If we go all the way back to where we started focused on the current events of today, what are you watching most carefully? I'm sure you're a good Bayesian and update your models of the world. What variables are most important to you looking forward as you watch what's happening with the war specifically? Marko: The most important thing is the rhetoric coming out of Kyiv, quite frankly, just because Zelenskyy is starting to build that case domestically I think for neutrality. And so we need to watch that. One of his speeches was very harsh on NATO, as I mentioned. So that's one of the things that I'm watching. The second thing that I'm watching is definitely the participation of China and Europe in negotiations on how to end this crisis without the US.In 2014, in 2015, the war in Donbas was ended because America didn't participate, and I suspect the same will happen now. The US has a luxury today, US has incredible luxury to not really care about the consequences of this conflict. I'm not saying American government is callous, but the US does have the luxury, it's behind an ocean, it can ban Russian oil as an example, we don't need it. The US is not going to have to deal with millions of refugees on its doorstep. The US has mutually assured destruction deterrent against Russia. Russia planes are not going to veer into US airspace by accident as they may in Poland and in Germany. And so because of that, I think the Europeans and the Chinese are actually probably going to solve this crisis without the US, just like they did with the Minsk negotiations. And so that's really important because it will further ossify and entrench us in a multipolar world going forward. Patrick: This has been a fascinating discussion. We could probably go in a million other directions and I'm sure we could do this once a year. I'm so appreciative of your time. I ask everybody the same traditional closing question. What is the kindest thing that anyone's ever done for you? Marko: I think the kindest thing is that recently I was in an event, I was in an event and just felt that things weren't going that great. It was just someone putting their arm around my shoulder and saying, ""Hey man, it doesn't really matter whether you're right or wrong. What really matters is if you're a good person or not."" That's probably, maybe not the kindest, but the most recent one I can think of. Patrick: Sounds great. Marko, thanks for your time and all the insight.

190,Garry Tan - Unwrapping the Gift,Introduction," Patrick: My guest today is Garry Tan, founder and managing partner of early stage venture firm, Initialized Capital. Before starting Initialized, Garry was a partner at Y Combinator, employee number 10 at Palantir, and co-founder of YC-backed blog platform, Posterous. Our discussion covers what's missing in the investment world, how to best systematize venture investments, and what he learned from Paul Graham. Please enjoy my conversation with Garry Tan.",108
191,Garry Tan - Unwrapping the Gift,Building the Global Brain," Patrick: Garry, could you begin by telling us what you mean by software and the global brain and why this concept is interesting to you right now given what's going on in the world? Garry: Yeah, it's actually something that I think is driving every organization that's trying to use software in the world. And actually, interestingly, it was brought to my attention by Yuri Milner of Digital Sky. He came to speak at Y Combinator and I remember him distinctly saying, one of the reasons why he invested in Facebook very early or relatively early at the $10 billion mark was that he came to a realization that something like 10% of the world's energy goes to data centers, which is also about the ratio that the brain consumes in a human body. And I don't know if that's true or not, but I thought that was very interesting. And all the world's people and all of the world's resources were coming together being organized around a nervous system that is basically the internet and software. And that was... He came to speak at Y Combinator probably 10 years ago or more, but I think ever since I heard that, I've been seeing that absolutely everywhere. And I think now if you look at every business that we like to fund or every business that's growing very quickly and reforming the way resources are delivered or all transactions are being sold, you can extend it all the way to crypto, what's happening is that it's that story, not just at the global brain level. Like we think about Facebook and social media, and we're not really sure. 10 years ago, we were very optimistic about those changes and today I think we're quite a bit less optimistic about those changes, probably rightly so. We don't know what it's doing to our children. We don't know what it's doing to our society and to political thought and to geopolitics.But what's interesting now I think rather than think too much at the global level, now what we can can do and what you and I can do is think about it at the local level. So maybe don't worry about Facebook. Someone else is going to solve that hopefully. What we do have very deep control over is our own organizations and our own communities. And how does that play out in our own world? And even lots of listeners here might be in startups. Some of them might be in financial institutions. No matter what organization and how old that organization is, every one of those organizations is reorganizing into a local brain. And I think that that's very interesting to me because that's something that's never happened before. It's often a one-time shift. On the one hand, it's easy to be cynical and say, well, we've had computers and smartphones and spreadsheets for a long time, but I would go further. Spreadsheets are just the first manifestation of it just because you might have semi-structured data in spreadsheets. It's like scarcely better than being on a clipboard or in a file cabinet. And I think we're seeing really big companies come and make things significantly better, faster, cheaper in very large industries like Flexport, for instance, and Logistics. There are these companies that aren't taking it above the spreadsheet level, above the pick up the phone level and turning it into structured data that lets you do things better, faster, cheaper, and ideally that lets you also create new types of organizations that are ideally more fair, more transparent. That's the story that I'm most interested in of the last 10 years, this idea that, hey man, we can't control the global that much, but we can control the local and then the global is constructed from that. Patrick: How do you think about that in terms of how it manifests in your investing and company activities? What is different about maybe what you might consider in a founding team or a company itself or a product as a result of this interesting shift from global to local? Garry: Act locally means try to take care of your own backyard before you go into your neighbor's I guess. So I run a venture firm called Initialized Capital and we started about 10 years ago. And one of the things that I learned from being a partner at Y Combinator for five years was that software can remake how investment is done. What Paul Graham did was he realized, hey, let's get a website online where anyone could apply and then let's write software to let a group of smart former founders figure out who the next set of founders could be. And that's actually a process that still happens every single day. I think people forget that there are tens of thousands of applications for these hundreds of spots that are in Y Combinator batch that happen twice a year. So it's really like the 2% acceptance rate or less that has held constant. And that was such a powerful moment for me because coming at it, I came up as an engineer. I came up as someone who I never thought I would work in finance. I never thought I would fund companies or help startups at scale the way that we were trying to do now. I grew up as the child of Chinese immigrants and we didn't have a lot honestly.Sometimes dinner was like some bread dipped in milk. That was the background that I had. And then tech really gave me the chance to get a six figure salary and then take care of my family and take care of my parents. I'm just really surprised at how much money there is in the world. And I think a lot of people, you have to take a moment to zoom out and realize there's been so much monetary expansion and what that means is capital is seeking yield. If I put it all together, what a gift it is to realize most people think there's too much money chasing too few good ideas and too few good people. But my experience in that thousands of applications, reading founders and problems that they're trying to solve and then trying to pick that 1% or 2%, and then since then at Initialized, funding hundreds of companies and 25 unicorns, what I learned was that's totally bunk. That's totally not true. It's definitely true that there's too much money, but there is just unbelievable number of very, very smart people who are locked in all kinds of professions and lives, geographies that do not get the most out of them. And I think if anything, the scarier thing that is true is the majority of things that people are working on, it's not maximizing their potential output for their fellow men.There's just an outrageous amount of emotional intelligence and real intelligence that is being squandered in organizations that are not local brains yet. They are somewhat pits of despair sometimes or they're locked in the game that people have to play in large corporations. I've worked in some of these and on the face of it, when I worked in Microsoft, there were like 12 levels between me and the CEO. And can you imagine the fiefdoms that emerged? I experienced the worst of it because I was the lowest of a low in that totem pole and the things that you have to do to get higher up in those organizations, all of that is not what's fundamental and fair. All that being said, I think the cool thing is there's an alternative, which is a startup, which is to me, there's so much wrapping paper in business period. There's ego, there's power distance to maintain 12 levels between the bottom most person trying to just do their work and the CEO. All of that is wrapping paper and the gift is creating a product or service that other people really need. What is the most powerful manifestation of that? It is the startup. It could be one or two people in a room sitting in front of a computer writing code that eventually turns into Coinbase.Talking with Brian Armstrong from Coinbase and I met him when he had quit his job at Airbnb. He sent me 0.1 Bitcoin using his Heroku-hosted Bitcoin wallet called bitbank.is. He was just one person in the idea maze trying to work backwards from what would we need to create the cryptocurrency and the Bitcoin world that we want to build? And this was 2011. And I think that is like one of the most pure manifestations. And if we pop back up, there are people like Brian Armstrong absolutely everywhere. In fact, a lot of them are probably listening right now. And to them, I want to say the water's fine. To say that there aren't enough problems to solve in the world is just lacking imagination. That's what our jobs as investors really are. How do we take this extreme overflow of capital? Like people don't have enough ideas left in the world. That's what people think, but it's not true. We just need to take our capital and apply it to people going after problems that are lying in plain sight. And the difficulty is it requires belief, it requires conviction, and we need more of that.",1884
192,Garry Tan - Unwrapping the Gift,What's Missing in the Worlds of Investing and Software," Patrick: There's something I know you're interested in already, but also just from doing research, which is the systemization of this style of investing, trying to treat as many things like a product versus just some genius investor or king making or picking people that there should be more throughput, I guess, in the funnel overall. I'm interested in the notion of immigration of locked value that you've talked about with people working somewhere else. There's so many interesting concepts here, but maybe we could start by you saying a bit about this notion of systematizing this style of investing as much as possible. I remember listening to Paul Graham in 2009 interview. I can't remember when YC was founded, but early days of YC, basically saying, look, what we're trying to build here is like a factory, like an assembly line that has as much throughput as possible. There's a reason these pitches are six minutes and they're back to back to back to back. What have you learned about trying to do that? I know you built internal software at Y Combinator. I think the idea of YC's Continuity came from you or partially from you. Just say everything you can about what's missing in the investing world that if it existed would increase this throughput for the benefit of everybody. Garry: It's really about attention. I want to go back to this idea of the wrapping paper versus the gift. And having been at YC and then now running a multi-billion dollar fund, the craziest thing to me is seeing that we don't need to necessarily do many hour pitches per se. YC was able to make something very valuable just in the 10-minute interview. Obviously a lot of people realize that whether a pitch will work or not is basically not the sum total of the 60 minutes. It tends to be the first five or 10 minutes. So this was always true anyway. And being on the other side helping founders try to tell their story, the number one thing that I get back is like if only I had more time. Actually, no, no, you don't need more time. You took too much time to begin with. If you're saying I have an idea that's so complex, you need to take time to understand it. That I think misunderstands human beings. Human beings are not complex enough to glom onto and put their lives towards an idea that can't be understood in 10 minutes or less actually. Sad to say, until an AI comes along that can load way more than five plus or minus two things in their brain, it's actually that. And I think the funniest thing that I had to learn from Paul Graham directly was I used to walk into these pitches and have this other attitude, which is, there are things that are so complicated that I cannot possibly understand them in 10 minutes. And I think that that's very dangerous thinking if you're an investor because that's how theranos happens. You're not trying to see the gift, you're trying to sift through the wrapping paper to look for certain pieces of foil. Every box that is wrapped in gold foil, a Stanford degree in CS, and they want to work at Google and they want to work at Facebook, it's wrapped in gold foil, guys. It's got to have a gift in it.And I'm sorry to say, and am one of those, I have a Stanford CS degree. Let me tell you, some of the people who applied to YC or some of the people who came from some of the most awesome pedigrees, they're the worst founders actually. The thing that people don't talk about is that the people who should be pulling the trigger on more of these investments should be the people who have most recently been builders because then you can look inside the box and you can interrogate inside the box as a gadget. Maybe you need metallurgy. Maybe you need user experience design. How do I press the button to make it work? There are all these different aspects to the craft itself of the mechanism that people are trying to build. And I think that's one of the things that I learned from Paul Graham the most, which is hard part about playing chess is being smart. It's not learning how the pieces move. So you need to look at companies at a much more fundamental level. That is not the gift wrapping. You need to look at the gift itself. Going back to how a lot of investors operate, it's very ego-driven. It's very driven by one personality or a bunch of lone wolves who happen to run in a pack, and I don't think that's how capital deployment should work. I genuinely believe we need a hive mind, and that's what we've done at Initialized.We have six total partners, including myself. When we meet companies, I tell every single person on our team, ""You have to be a 100% totally true to yourself"". Also, the backgrounds of people are completely different. We have someone who's been general counsel and a lawyer for many years. We have someone who is literally building apps for The New York Times. We have someone who built software with me at YC. We have designers. We have journalists. We have people with totally different 10,000 hours with very different networks and totally different expertise. That's because diverse points of view matter. The gift itself, the startup itself that's going to work, it requires not just one person to say, ""I believe and I'm going to devote my life to it."" It requires all of those different expertise. You're going to need great design. You're going to need marketers. You need sales people. You're going to need engineers. You're going to need PMs. Think about the sum total of all the different expertise that you need to create something that really touches a billion people. The more that I can get more people with those different disparate backgrounds on my team in that decision making room, the better we can make a decision together to make it awesome. Patrick: Sort of a two-part question. First is, what I'll let you answer first and then I want to plant another one. The one I'll plant is if there was no time or money or any energy limitations, what software you would snap into existence if the North Star was to fund as many viable, interesting potential startups as possible? What is the if we work backward from a perfect end state to make this whole process more frictionless, faster, more throughput, whatever, what would exist that doesn't? I'm sure you're going to a path towards that because you said you built custom software at YC to do this. You're doing it at Initialized now. I'll begin by asking what have you built so far? If you recognize new opportunities, some deal comes onto your radar, for some reason, some founder comes on your radar, what does the machine look like that you're dropping that piece of information into today at Initialized? Garry: The systems-level thing is that we actually have to be very fast about getting back to people. Being able to schedule an all-partner in 48 hours or less is actually really important. Being able to make an investment decision with a group process without short circuiting due diligence within 48 to 72 hours, just speed is important because speed kills deals. It's hyper-competitive, as you know. It's actually very interesting because as Initialized has grown in prominence, it's very easy to rest on your laurels and say, ""Well, they should totally take our money because we're so and so."" It actually requires constant gardening there. No, no, this is still an economic decision. The second we think that someone's going to wait for us, that's us depriving ourselves of making the best possible product. That's a fast path to being not relevant at all in a matter of years, really.There is a constant gardening that's necessary as well. First is speed. Second is a two-step process of actually disagree, but commit. The first part is we actually have two rounds of blind voting that's all in the software. We don't sit around in a room after the founder leaves and shoot the stuff about things and lean back. We have to lean forward, make a decision on the spot that is true only to us. Then that's why it's two rounds of blind voting. I don't want people to think, oh, because me or someone else on the team wants to do it, that they should vote a certain way. I want people to be totally true to themselves. Then between the first vote and the final vote, we should have that actual space to talk through, ""Well, did you think about this?"" In my expertise on the PR side, I'm worried about what they did six months ago. Did you see this blog post? That way, we can have the synthesis. That's really what I think of when I think of a local brain. The funniest example of that, I think, is have you ever looked at a cheeseburger and you're like, ""Oh, I really want to eat that cheeseburger.""? Then there's a synthesis moment where other parts of your brain with other priorities, with other governors are saying, ""Hey, you're on a diet,"" or, ""Hey, your cholesterol's up. Hey, don't you want to live to 100."" There's all this interplay that happens at the moment of a decision. A very smart decision is a very integrated decision. I think of every partner and every decision that we make as a firm, as actually a moment for the firm itself to reaffirm its integration with one another.Then we have a final vote because it's not about getting to consensus. It's actually about people still being true to themselves. Then it seems like, from our experience, either the best things are generally meet the bar for consensus and obvious or they're so controversial that someone has to use a silver bullet. I think that's just a function of the fact that all the best opportunities they're lying in plain sight. You don't have thousands of teams going after it. The things that seem to be really, really big are not there yet. There's a reason why, from a [Tillian] sense, we often ask ourselves, what do we believe that nobody else believes? We ask the founders that too. If there isn't one of those things embedded in an anti-mimetic aspect to the business, often we don't want to fund it. That's why you have to make space for the super contrarian. Even that, internal to the person who's going to fire the silver bullet, is a decision. My partners don't see it, but I see it. I have such high conviction we're going to do it. We need to make space for that stuff. Then once we actually commit, they're part of the family. The war is over. It's like we have to help them no matter what because we own 10% to 20% of that company. We are like one with that founder at that point. That's how we think about making decisions.Then the bigger question is how do you actually scale that? I'm still trying to figure that out, actually. I think that the basic mechanism is there. The harder part is how do you make the pie big enough? How do you attract people? That's something that we're still figuring out. I think that a lot of it is about making an environment that is much more long lasting, something that Initialized itself needs to be a startup the way the startups we want to fund are, which is we're trying to build this thing that's never existed before. It's going to take being a part of a system. The alternative is actually extremely compelling. The alternative that's happening out there that I think is awesome. They're amazing people out there who are doing it par excellence. Elad Gil, for instance, as a solo capitalist is the best angel that I've ever met. He's doing it at a scale that never been done before. That's the alternative. For me, what I really believe is if you want to go fast, go alone. Then if you want to go far, you got to go together. The hardest part is finding more and more people who are doing it for, frankly, the right reasons. Everyone who gets to work in this job, period, everyone's going to make an outrageous amount of money. In the back rooms and at the water cooler of other VCs, if you really listen to what people are saying, there's just so much tension around control, around who gets more carry. It starts to resemble the wrapping paper of big companies that really don't serve people. At some point, it becomes a clash of egos. All of those things give me nightmares because that's not how I want to do the business. That's not how I think the best VCs do the business. Patrick: I remember a conversation with Dave, the founder of Upstart. If you ask him to articulate his vision, there's this version of the future where debt capital is available for given reason to an individual programmatically. Meaning there's enough objective information about the person to know whether or not they're eligible and you press a button and they're instantly approved or not for a certain line of credit or whatever. What is in the way of that happening for early-stage equity capital? Why is there not, and do you think there ever will be, literally just an objective application that sets a price at which equity capital is just tappable and available? Obviously, I don't want to get into fringe cases of fraud or whatever, outliers or gaming the system, but just generally speaking, it seems that if there are more great people out there, like you said, at the beginning, automated funding mechanisms, like you could argue YC's approach to this general idea, although with still lots of human judgment, how much human judgment can we take out of this, just someone's willing to give up a third of their company for $100,000 or something? Is there a natural extension of this that's just automatic, programmatic equity capital as a service? Garry: In a world where's there's infinite capital, the real scarcity is actually trust. I think it's Munger who talks about the ideal world that you live in is one where there's very, very deep, mutual shared and earned trust. I think earned is a big part of it, actually. The hardest part is we don't have enough hours in the day. We don't have enough networks that have gelled together to determine these are the people who have done great, who have the skills, who are capable. That's actually the limiting reagent. There's no objective measure of a good pitch, for sure. Anyone can say anything. The worst thing is in an objective world, you might be tempted to borrow crypto Ethereum or an Oracle. People in the business world do this. You and I wouldn't outsource our understanding of a market. We'd want to hire a team and really understand what the data sources are and then draw our own conclusions based on that. Even if you hire GLG, you'd have to go and figure out who those sources are and make an understanding of how much can I trust this? It's not capital that's in short supply. It is actually trust.There is one mechanism that I think is very powerful, which is a society that is hard to join, then one that enforces certain expectations is actually necessary. One example of this is, at YC, people are much more open about their secrets. They'll walk you through and show you how they approach Facebook Ads, for instance, if you ask. Imagine doing that same thing when you went to, nothing against TechCrunch Disrupt, and it's a great conference, but if you go there and someone sitting next to you is like, ""Hey, could you show me your Facebook Ads, show me how to do it,"" would you do it? You'd probably hold back some of the stuff. That's the thing that's hard. We need more communities in which you can share and be true to yourself with way less wrapping paper. That's the tricky thing about building these networks of mutual trust is that they're very rare and they're very, very hard to build.",3449
193,Garry Tan - Unwrapping the Gift,Evaluating Ideas and People," Patrick: I love the notion of inspecting the gadget versus the gold-leafing or something. Reminds me of a comment that I heard Matt Cohler say one time. We were talking about inventors or how to identify great inventors, at some of these, especially tech-forward companies are almost started by inventors like Edisons. His simple comment was like, ""Who cares about the inventor? Look at the invention. If it's a good invention, it's probably a good inventor."" Garry: Exactly, exactly. Patrick: With that in mind, when you're looking at the invention, what are you looking for? What is shared in common across them, you've got a very high reference class. You've looked at a gazillion of these things, you've funded a lot, lots of them have been really successful. What in that initial grappling with the invention or the gadget is common from company to company? What are you looking for? What's the reaction in yourself that you're looking for? Just talk about that initial engagement. Garry: I remember meeting Apoorva Mehta from Instacart. He emailed me and all the other YC partners at the time. He said, ""I'm working on this startup. No matter what, I want to be in YC."" YC, of course, is a 10-week program. I think three or four weeks had already passed. Half of it was over. I said, ""Hey, man. You should apply to the next batch. It'd be almost impossible to get you in."" Apoorva said, ""So you're saying there's a chance."" Then he sent me a six pack of beer. I was sitting in my office in Mountain View doing office hours, someone knocks on my door and drops off a six pack of 21st Amendment stout in the can form. It was amazing. That beer is always special to me for the rest of my life now because I said, ""What is this?"" Then I downloaded the app. I was one of the first couple, maybe 100 people, to try the app off of TestFlight. I will tell you, there's this quote from Steve jobs where he says, ""A cabinet maker can tell another cabinet maker not by looking at the front. Everyone can look at the front. They turn around and look at the back."" For me, that moment was seeing that it was smooth scrolling. I mean, people were still making these poorly-threaded demo apps. Here it was, I scrolled thousands of grocery items. It worked really well. The images came in and were threaded properly. That's when I knew. Not only is this a demo app, but it's a demo app that was done the right way. Of course, he had a driver app. He'd already hired two people off of Craigslist to do it.We also had seen probably dozens of other people try to do exactly that app. Uber was out. There was this idea that you can make a mass workforce driven by smartphones. I think Android and smartphone penetration had reached like 60% or 70%, which is a real why now? I just will never forget that moment. Like you said, you examine the invention and then it tells you so much about the inventor. What that also tells me is if I were, instead of an investor at that moment at Y Combinator, if was trying to decide if I was going to go work there, that was going to be the way I could tell I wanted to work there. It's like, ""Hey, this person made a thing that's awesome. If they can make this, they're going to attract other people who can recognize that this is awesome. Through the like attracts like principle, this is going to be a magnet for all the other smartest people who know how to build."" I think that's underrated, actually. People don't realize this, but people who are really, really good at building, really like working with other people who know how to build. That's the real currency of being able to build software in Silicon Valley is actually where the builders go, where they want to work, that tends to be the thing that is the future. We still use that as one of the primary things that we look for when we sit across the founder is if I weren't doing what I'm doing now, which I love doing this. If I was going to go look for a job, would this be one of the top 10 places that I would want to go work at? Can you convince me? Then we look at all of each other with all of these different backgrounds. It's like, would all of us go work there? The cool thing is if you have a fund that is a bunch of people who, if you did go work there you'd be a pretty good startup, that's actually a really good situation because that's actually what needs to happen out there.What we realize is that every startup that could be a billion dollar startup is actually a Schelling point for talent. Then Initialized now, what I realize is when you build a brand in VC, you get to be a Schelling point of Schelling points. We want to attract founders who then want to attract the engineers and designers and product people to go and make the self-fulfilling prophecy of a startup actually work. We're starting to see that now, which is just really, really interesting. Just people coming and saying, ""If I get money from you, I'm going to hire another echelon of executive or engineer."" They don't care even about the money as much anymore. These startups are getting thrown absolutely insane deals, absolutely all of the time. Nobody seems to care about just having money anymore. The absolute top end realizes I need to pick my investor the way I pick actually an executive. What are they going to do for me actually? Patrick: Are you able to evaluate somebody? Do you often, if you can't poke around in the invention, meaning it's not built yet, someone's that just starting out with just an idea or an initial team or something very, very basic, but no actual thing to show you yet? Garry: Yeah, absolutely. At that point, we often need to rely on our prior relationship or seeing what they built before. And then I think that actually can work really well, too. Sometimes there are people with just a deck, but they happen to have the ideal people involved to attack that problem. I think of Roe who came to us, Zachery Ratono. I worked with at YC previously, and then he came to us with Rob Schutz, who was the head of digital marketing at BarkBox. So he brought BarkBox from zero to 100 million a year in revenue, less than 12 months, 18 months, maybe, really, really fast. Just one of the world's experts at buying ads on Facebook and Google actually, which back then, but it continues to be true now. You can think of being able to buy digital advertising at scale like that similar to being a high frequency trader. There are like dozens of people in the world who really know how to do it well and almost every single one of those people, you could probably stand up a D to C company that could be dominant. That knowledge is so rare and so valuable, so you have to rely on what are the unique skill sets to that market. Of course, they were going into selling Viagra online. That's kind of perfect. And the coolest thing is when you have people who are that smart and that ambitious, they were able to take something that was an incredible thin edge of the wedge and now they're turning it into one of the defining digital health brands.",1651
194,Garry Tan - Unwrapping the Gift,The Most Common Bad Ideas," Patrick: Back in 2012, you wrote this funny thing about the worst but very common bad startup idea was travel planning software. What about that was a bad idea? And then I'm curious if you fast forward to today, what the most common bad idea is that you see today? Garry: Travel planning is this amazingly attractive problem. One of the reasons I think is I remember being in my 20s and wishing that I could travel. How cool would that be to be able to spend all of my time thinking about travel? And then the tricky thing was, and it remains true now, I had met someone from Yahoo, was a recruiter, and I was asking them about, I don't know how it came up, Yahoo Travel. There used to be a travel planner service at Yahoo. And he said, ""Oh yeah, that's the thing that we use to get college kids to apply to us because they all want to go work on that thing and then I get their resume and then we put them in the system and then we can hire them with this idea that they'll work on this."" And I was like, that's interesting. And it was like, is it actually a good business? It's like, no, it's not a good business. It doesn't make money. And it goes back to what we were saying earlier. All of these consumer brands end up being about two things, customer acquisition cost and lifetime value. And travel planning happened to be one of those places where it's either equal or the LTV is much lower than the cost of acquisition, actually. It's a really tough market. And if you can't rely on buying eyeballs, then you have to look at organic. And at that point, organic, especially for things that resemble social networks, they only work if you have daily or weekly use. And most people, we should be so lucky to live in a society where everyone gets to travel all the time, maybe bad for CO2, but it would be an amazing world that would be much more connected. But it just doesn't happen that often. You don't have inorganic means to get customers in a profitable way. Turns out that's not a good business. Patrick: What do you think that idea is today? What is the most common or modal bad idea that you see today? Garry: I saw a tweet yesterday in the Crypto World that said we don't need more Dow tools. We need more Dows. So everyone and their mother is trying to make new tools to help people make decentralized autonomous organizations. But we actually really need more of the organizations first. We don't need more picks and shovels. That's not the hard part. People don't even know how to do it yet. That's always the funniest thing. People over index on what is hot is the tricky thing. Patrick: Everyone talks a lot about the amazing outcomes, the power law distribution of returns and venture. A lot of stuff fails and I'm sure you've been a part of a lot of businesses that had that great early gadget, but just ultimately didn't work. What are the most common reasons for failure in this type of business that you've observed again and again? Garry: The first is probably not having a team that has the skills. You so often run into people who can't code, but want to do a startup and then don't have a co-founder who can code. That's probably the number one. And to them, I say, hey, one of you, or both of you should learn to code. It doesn't mean you have to code forever. Life is short, but it's not that short and learning to code means that you'll know exactly what to say to someone who could be your technical co-founder. And in fact, technical co-founders would rather work with non-technical co-founders who know how to code because then you can actually speak the language instead of talk past each other. And that's the number one. Number two, I think, would be picking markets that don't exist. And that's really hard because I think it was Chris Dixon who coined this idea of the idea maze. I use this all the time because when you are trying to create something new, you are entering into a maze and you know how in StarCraft there's this fog around you, the map is fogged, and then you only figure out what's in front of your face. That's what's happening when you're running a startup, especially in a market that doesn't exist or a brand new market. And we are exploring the idea maze all the time. Actually, there's a nuance point in there, which is most first time founders end up trying to look in the part of the maze that's already explored, because it's easy. That's like trying to find your keys under the lamppost. It's not under the lamppost. It's out there in the darkness. It's hard out there. First, you have to find the frontier of the idea maze of that fog and then you have to bump your face into a bunch of walls, turn around and then find the way out. That's the process of finding product market fit.That's also a subtle point. Either you're in the maze and you're looking where lots of other people have looked and most investors or most other founders who have explored that space thoroughly will say, ""Hey man, there's a wall there."" And then there's a special case there too, because sometimes a founder, if you have a new innovation, some sort of new technology or maybe the market changes, maybe there's a new platform, there's a new hardware, there's new capabilities. Sometimes in the part of the maze that there's been a wall there for 20 years, suddenly that wall goes away. I would look at Instacart being able to rush in and do grocery delivery with a mobile workforce deployed over the smartphone. There was a wall there which is people didn't have smartphones and then at that moment, the wall went away and then Apoorva and Instacart were right there at that maze. So I don't know. I mean, I can torture this analogy to death, but the reality is all of these things happen. We see it every single day. It's so crazy to see. Patrick: Is every example like this, you've mentioned Coinbase and Instacart for which this is definitely true. But in all the cases you can think of, is there always some big enabling technology change that makes the window open? Like the why now is always clear in hindsight, or even in the meeting for these biggest outcomes? Garry: The way that we try to approach it is to suspend disbelief. If someone comes in and says, what Brian Armstrong came in and said was we're going to upend the global financial system with something that is open and the blockchain, it's very easy to look at the total ARR of all of this cryptocurrency stuff is sub a billion dollars. This is very fringe. Look at what Wall Street Journal is saying. You would just say no on the spot. But if you come at it with a different angle, which is if what this person is saying is true, what would happen? One thing I like to ask would we choose to live in that world? And the answer when it comes to technology, sometimes that answer is no. Sometimes you run across the technology and it's like, oh, it's going to change society in X, Y, and Z ways. And I wouldn't choose to live in that world. And it might be a great business. Someone can make money doing it, but I don't think I want to be a part of that. I think it cuts both ways. The nos in those are more important than the yeses sometimes.",1691
195,Garry Tan - Unwrapping the Gift,"Initialized's Past, Present and Future"," Patrick: I love that if this all goes swimmingly, what does the world look like? How does it look different? And do we want that world to exist or not? It's kind of interesting and hard question. What's the role for you of media in investing? This is a topic that every investor is kind of interested in. All of a sudden, it's a common thing to say you want to have some sort of media strategy. You've been doing this a long time. How do media and investing intersect today? How should they intersect? What have you learned about this intersection? Garry: Well, I would dig back into what we started the conversation with, which is there's infinite people in the world, but the limiting reagent for that is actually knowhow and access to knowledge and networks, given that media is necessary and important for investors period now. In the past, I think, 20, 30, 50 years ago, the way it was done, you just had to be in the right club or born in the right place or be the right person's son. That's not how it is anymore and I think that's awesome. Now we can truly harness the full potential of a workforce that is billions large. And that was never true before. It used to be a very privileged few who got access to capital, very privileged few who got to create businesses. And then that's a self-fulfilling prophecy itself. Too much money chasing too few ideas, too few people. I was like, that's a self-fulfilling prophecy. You're choosing to live in that world if you believe that. That's where media is so important because Paul Graham with his essays taught me you don't have to have a job. You weren't many to have a job. You could be a founder.If you are an engineer, if you were a physicist and you understood how the atom worked, you would be able to look at the periodic table and predict what the next element on the periodic table is, which is itself a very powerful idea, I think. And that's what I want. We want to teach people about the atom and for every single one of those, you've got a billion dollar company that could touch a billion people. That's what I want. At the end of the day, every business actually is a meme now. To go back to the global brain idea, I think Naval talks about this all the time. You go back even a couple decades and mass media was the few speaking to the many. And then we are now in this other age of truly the many to many. Every single person on the planet who has electricity and access to the internet, you might not have a reason to, but increasingly we do have a reason and to be able to operate locally to then construct this global brain that hopefully will drive us to a world that we all choose to live in. Patrick: Could you tell me the story of the episode or individual piece of work that you are most proud of? Garry: I have to say at this point, I'm most proud of Initialized as a firm because I think that we're entering this other realm of I don't want it to be about me and my personality. I never really entered it with that idea. It goes all the way down to how I want to approach working with founders, which is this idea of I'm not different than you, I'm the same. And to me, it's really about how do we get all the way to the gift? How do we just talk about the mechanics of making a thing that's never existed before? If we can strip it down to just the signal and have no noise around it, that's what I really want.All of this feels fractal to me. Initialized is the defining startup of my life that then is about helping other people create the defining startups of their lives. We are a shelling point of shelling points. If you want to create something that touches a billion people with the high integrity and the bottom up nature of how we want to do it, then we want to talk to you and we want to put you in a community of all the other people who are exactly like that. And together with that mutual shared trust, a network of people who help each other, that's what the world needs the most of right now, right at this moment. It's the biggest mission that I could think of is making this magic happen more. Patrick: If you think about the history of the firm so far and even projecting to the future a little bit, to what do you attribute you maybe winning at that task? What were the major decisions or choices or things that you built that made this the thing that you're most proud of? What contributed to that outcome? Garry: I think some of it was a personal journey for me. I grew up with a pretty tough childhood, child of an alcoholic, and I would say that the biggest transformation for me over the past five or six years was a journey inwards to realize what made me very different. For instance, I realized at some point that what I need, which is a situation that is high love and low structure. I thrive on chaos. I actually thrive. I just love an ambiguous situation because that's where I can start putting structure in and figure things out. It also gives me like great freedom and flexibility. One of the things I had to realize is that's not how most people are wired at all. And it was a big surprise to me, actually. It was my executive coach, Cameron Yarbrough, at the time who helped me understand that what works for me does not work for other people. The ideal situation is actually a high structure, high love situation. And it took a lot of self work to actually realize, oh, hey, that's actually how we do it. Especially because taking a step back used to assume that process and bureaucracy, I thought it was bureaucratic and I thought it was part of the wrapping paper.And I think one of the big things that I came around to is realizing, yeah, when you're two or three people in a room, that part is wrapping paper because you don't need three C levels in a room to do anything. The titles are wrapping paper at that point. And then now what I realize, I spent five years of my career as an investor just working with rooms of two or three people. And now the evolution over the past five or six years has been seeing not just that early stage, but also that stage of you're hiring your first 20 people. Then you're hiring your 80 people on top of that. You're a 100 person team now. You're hiring your first C levels. You're hiring people who you need to get to 1,000 employees to be able to create a compound startup the way Parker Conrad is doing at Rippling. So now I understand the early game and the late game is very, very different, and I had to internalize that and realize that. And then now I realize because in the past I failed at this, my startup back in 2008, Posterous. I failed at this. Right at the moment we were 20 people and I needed to switch into a manager role and create structure for others.I was still clinging to this idea of writing all the code and doing all the design, and that was exactly the wrong thing. Posterous went deep in the idea maze and we didn't make it. And of course, we made money for investors and ourselves and our employees made out fine with the acquisition to Twitter, but I didn't make it to the promise land. I think we topped out it maybe 100 million or 200 million monthly actives period. I didn't make it to a billion people. But now I realize, hey, if I enter this with humility, I'm here to help and I'm not perfect. In fact I messed this up exactly, but I don't want you to mess it up. When we're in the idea maze with the founder, that's actually the best thing I can do. What I realized is I used to worry, like do I have enough of an ego for this business? And now I realize what was different about us all along is that we got rid of the wrapping paper. We started off the game without the ego, and then it's resulting in better outcomes. The biggest thing is finding my own confidence, perhaps, over the past five or six years. Patrick: If there was a button that if you pressed it would retroactively make your childhood easy, would you press it? Garry: Not right now. I also wouldn't wish that on others. I also wouldn't choose to experience it again; but having done it, it also makes you who you are. That's the conundrum. Patrick: Do you ever see founders that don't have some sort of similar extreme adversity early in their lives? Garry: Even when people deny that they had adversity, I think if you introspected enough, I think at the core of every person's human existence, there is some form of it, even if you deny it completely. This is a familiar experience for me, because actually I spent most of my 20s denying that it had an impact on me. I had spent most of my time trying to be normal. Then now I realized, no, no, I was never normal to begin with, and that's actually okay. In order to create an organization or a local brain that's integrated, you yourself need to be far more integrated. It's fractal in that sense. Patrick: What does the word integration mean in this context? Garry: An example of non-integration is denying your own experience, for instance, to say that I'm normal and that I never had these experiences. It would come up in all these sorts of different ways, in the moment when I was in a meeting and my face got hot, and I didn't know myself. It's like, oh, I don't know why I'm feeling a little hot tempered right now. What's happening? A lack of integration is saying, ""Well, I'm just going to let the people around me have that."" A more integrated version of it would be saying, ""Let me understand. Where is that from?"" And then, ""How do I direct it?"" Also, to accept it. More integration results in just better decisions. We can live in a better harmony if we are true to ourselves, Patrick: If you use your portfolio as the glasses or lens through which you view the world, what's going on in the world that is most interesting, bizarre, notable? What are the winds of change that you see through the portfolio itself today in 2022? Garry: The sheer fact that there's so much capital in the world, I think, is highly under capitalized. I mean, I think at the venture level, we just talked through why I think Initialized is pretty cool, but we're seeing it more broadly everywhere in society. One example I think would be Formic, which is a company we funded at seed. Lux just did their series A, and it's working. The founder actually was a AI venture capitalist for Baidu Ventures previously, so he was on the board of a number of robotic startups. He wanted to start a robotic startup that wasn't focused on these computer vision, ML, control systems part. He realized that there were plenty of very smart people doing all of that stuff. What we really needed was the ability to go to market, the factories, the global manufacturers, but also the American manufacturers, of which there are thousands and thousands. They actually just don't adopt it. The question is why?Then if you keep asking those five whys, the Jeff Bezos five whys, you start finding out all of these crazy things. [Salman [Fareed] , the founder, realized that a lot of these small manufacturers want to, but they're afraid because they don't know what the good system integrator is. If you choose the wrong system integrator, you just flushed a million dollars down the toilet. That's a million dollars that a small manufacturer cannot afford. Also, really, you're going to put a million dollars in off your balance sheet? Your balance sheet might not even have a million dollars. The GMV of these things might be tens of millions, but you're running such a razor thin operation, you don't have the gross margin for it. So when you zoom out, you realize, oh, these are the real problems that real American manufacturers face. There are tens of thousands of them that all have this.It's funny because you think that the world is asking those questions, but they're not. So Salman said, ""We're going to square the circle. We're going to go, and we're going to get financing so these SMBs don't have to put it on their balance sheet. Not only that, we're going to find and take the technology risk completely out. So we're going to find our own system integrators and do it for them, and then they're just going to pay us an hourly wage, the way they would pay a worker."" That's what they want. They assume no risk. They get all of the return. Then we get some of the highest yielding IRR that exists in a very pure form of yield. I think this is a startup that can make $100 million a year net with only a couple thousand machines in operation, and we've got 20 up now. There are these crazy macro discoveries that are lying in plain sight that we run across every single day. I just really, really love those. I think basically, I would call these things outcomes as a service. How do we take this thing that we all complain about, which is yield is so low, and then how do we turn it into an asset? Which is that everything that could be happening that's high IRR, should be. Patrick: Garry, this is so much fun. I've learned a lot. Think your perspective's very unique and different. I ask everybody the same traditional closing question in these conversations. What is the kindest thing that anyone's ever done for you? Garry: I think of, honestly, Paul Graham and Jessica Livingston meeting us for our totally harried 10-minute pitch for Posterous, the blog platform back in 2008. They said yes. I'm finding out how deep this rabbit hole goes now. Thank you for funding us and then introducing me to a world where I wasn't meant to have a job. In fact, we're here to help everyone else create a million jobs and to touch a billion people. It's not really even about the billion dollar startup. It's really about building the world that we want to live in. Patrick: Garry, it's been so much fun. Thank you for your time.

196,Eric Mandelblatt - Investing in the Industrial Economy,Introduction," Patrick: My guest today is Eric Mandelblatt, founder and CIO of Soroban Capital, a $10 billion investment firm. While many of my conversations focus on technology and emerging industries, Eric has deep roots investing in the industrial economy, which made this conversation a fun change of pace. We discussed why energy and materials represent such a small share of the market today, how the global push towards decarbonization could have massive impacts on the industrial economy moving forward, and how Eric evaluates this dynamic opportunity set. Please enjoy this deep dive discussion with Eric Mandelblatt.Quick editor's note before the episode. This conversation was recorded on February 15th, before last week's invasion of Ukraine.",157
197,Eric Mandelblatt - Investing in the Industrial Economy,Eric's Background and Soroban's Portfolio," Patrick: Eric, since this conversation's going to be in incredible depth about industrials specifically, and a huge set of themes that you and the firm have been working on for a long time, I think it is really appropriate to set the stage a little bit. Normally I'd handle background information and the introductions. I'm the kind of person that skips the childhood in section of biographies. But in this particular case, it's a big and fairly new topic for us. So, I think the background of where you're coming from is really important. So, maybe you can give us the thumbnail sketch of Soroban's history and why you are the right person to be talking to about this big theme. Eric: Sure. Well first of all, I appreciate you having me on the podcast. Honored to be here, Patrick. Maybe let me take you one step back further, which is where I started my career. I was hired in 1998 at Goldman Sachs as a natural gas analyst. Ironically, the biggest company we covered at the time was Enron. We covered natural gas pipelines, utilities. I learned about the commodity business at Goldman in 1998 to 2002. Ultimately transferred into one of the proprietary investing groups at Goldman, and then left to help start a hedge fund by the name of TPG Axon Capital in 2005, and then landed at Soroban and launched the firm in 2010. I tell a funny story. When we launched our firm, folks thought of our firm as being an energy focused hedge fund, and we had to wave our hands in the air and say, ""No, no, no. We're investing in consumer. We're investing in tech."" We're investing in business services industries as well, but the core roots of the firm originally were really on the commodities and industrial side, which is just my background given where I started my career at Goldman. Patrick: So, maybe walk us through all the way to the end, what the portfolio looks like today at a high level. Because people get sick of hearing me use the quote, ""Don't tell me what you think. Just tell me what's in your portfolio."" It's an interesting two-pronged approach to what you own. So, just overview for us what that looks like today, so that we can get into the nitty gritty of everything going on. Eric: A framing comment. We love to own good structural compounding monopoly, oligopoly businesses at good prices, just like everybody else. Our portfolio is actually quite simple today. Over 80% of the firm's risk is in three sectors. One, big tech. Our biggest position by a mile is Microsoft. It's been our biggest position for the last few years, but our big tech positions are about a third of capital. That's Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet. We have 25% of the firm's capital in two of the leading Class I railroads in the United States, CSX Corp and Union Pacific. And then we have about 30% of the firm's capital today in commodity levered equities in a variety of sub-industries, metals and mining, energy, chemicals being the big ones. So, you take a third plus 25 plus 30, and you have the vast majority of our portfolio exposure today. Patrick: Maybe we'll come back to the big tech positions if we have time at the end, but that's not where we're going to spend our time and energy today just because I think it's much more unique to talk about those two other places, rails and commodity exposed equities. Maybe walk us through the high level idea here. Maybe even opening with some framing you've given me before around just how much of these sectors the competitive hedge fund world owns. You did an interesting investigation here. I couldn't believe the number. Maybe that's good framing so we can dive into why you find this different looking portfolio so interesting. Eric: Our firm is at peak industrial economy exposure. We've been at it for 12 years. We have 55% of the firm's capital invested in the industrial economy. When I was thinking about our thematic positioning back in 4Q, I just ran a screen and I pulled the 30 largest hedge funds that do what we do. Classic long-short concentrated hedge funds. Those 30 funds had $410 billion of invested capital as of the end of the third quarter. I don't have the updated numbers yet. Of the $410 billion of invested capital, less than $1 billion was invested in the energy sector. 20 basis points. 130 basis points was invested in the materials industry, although I would argue that was misleading because they were largely specialty chemical businesses that are really not commodity exposed, really cyclical businesses. So, our peers had less than 2% of their portfolio allocated to materials and energy.Soroban on the other hand today has 30% of its portfolio invested in energy and materials. And then we have this big wedge with an additional quarter of our portfolio on the industrial side. It struck me and there's a lot of indicators of this, that the hedge fund community, specifically which is what you're asking about, Patrick, is really crowded around growth-oriented sectors. It's an obvious point. To have survived in the last decade, you needed to be levered to growth, you need it to be levered to tech. And that's where largely the dollars are flooding today in terms of when I think about our exposure versus our peers. So, we have 55% of our portfolio in the industrial economy, including industrials as a subsector. Our peers have about 10% of their portfolio in the industrial economy.  Patrick: Maybe give us a bit, it might require a few of these, history lessons around how we got to here. Because I remember early in my career when energy represented whatever it was, 12%, 13% of the S&P 500. Today, it's a pittance it's a tiny amount, maybe a bit higher than that 20 basis points you quoted in the hedge fund peer group. But it's incredibly low. All of the commodity stuff, oil and other commodities became a non-issue for a long period of time. No one talked about it. No one really wrote about it. Oil went negative at one point. What are the key history lesson timeline points that you think matter to understand why industrials as a broad group have become more interesting today? Is it globalization? Is it de-globalization? What are the big ideas here that you think matter? Eric: Let me just frame. Energy and materials, which is the two biggest buckets in addition to industrials within the industrial economy. Energy and materials, when we launched our firm, were 17% weight in the S&P 500. Today they're 5%. The energy sector weight is down to 80% in the last decade, just as a framing comment. So, what happened? Why has there been this massive de-rating? One obvious point: Tech growth have massively outperformed. They've grown as a percentage of the index and then the inverse, energy and materials have massively underperformed in a decade long, particularly the last 5+ years, decade long down cycle in commodities that was driven by excess capacity that built up in China, in industries like steel and aluminum. It was, and we can talk more about it, partly driven by the shale boom in North America, which while an amazing thing for the United States was massively deflationary for the energy patch.So. You had a lot of capacity added in China 10+ years ago. The metals and mining companies, the energy companies were adding significant new capacity through capex in the first half of the last decade. And basically we entered a period of relatively slow industrial production growth in the last decade. So, all this supply was added. US shale is the best example of that. All this supply was added in a backdrop where demand was a lot softer in industrial production levered industries, relative to the prior decade. And the intersection of lots of supply and a weak demand backdrop has meant commodity prices have been substantially depressed, particularly in the last five years.And I think maybe one way to frame it for you is we launched our firm November 1st, 2010 at Soroban. On a cumulative basis, inception to date, over almost 11.5 years, the Goldman Sachs commodity index is flat in 11.5 years. During that time period, the NASDAQ 100 index has compounded 20% a year. So, we have this massive dichotomy that's built up where on one hand tech levered industries, growth levered industries have been fabulous performers in the market and largely driven by earnings and revenue growth. And then on the other hand, the commodity world's been flattened like a pancake because of excess supply that built up and a relatively weak demand backdrop. And the intersection of those two has led to really depressed commodity prices today.",1920
198,Eric Mandelblatt - Investing in the Industrial Economy,Supply and Demand Forces in Commodities," Patrick: I'm sure the answer varies by commodity, by different parts of the world, but I think we've become so used to the ability of supply to catch up to demand in the digital world instantly or extremely quickly, whereas in the physical world there are cycles. There's undersupply, there's building of supply, there's a lot on the other side. Walk us through what cycles look like in commodities. What drives them, how long does capex take to get outlaid to start pulling more commodities out of the ground? Give us a tutorial on how this world works, because it's not this instant supply demand matching like we've come to expect in digital economies. Eric: We're not going to reprogram the software. It's a lot more complicated than that. Let's use numbers to frame. Global oil and gas capex in the middle part of the last decade was running $0.5 trillion a year. Global metals and mining capex was running $140 billion a year. So, these are big capital-intensive businesses. Frankly, it's why investors don't like them. They're cyclical and they're capital intensive, but it depends upon the industry. All industries within commodities are not the same, but these tend to be pretty long lead time, long capital cycle commodities. Again, US shale would be an exception to that. But I'll use copper as an example. First of all, 3 of the largest 10 copper mines in the world today were discovered over 100 years ago. And we estimate that from start to completion, if you and I, Patrick wanted to go build a copper mine in the Andes Mountains today, we estimate based on the mines that were developed over the last 10 years, that is a roughly 10 to 15 year investment cycle. Meaning we're going to this project to FID and it's going to take us a decade plus in order to bring supply online. So, the punchline here is these tend to be relatively long lead time industries. Again, depends upon your sub-industry. It's tough to be too generic. What's different this cycle versus previous cycles is what I would call the relative inelasticity of supply growth. This is a key investment theme for us here at Soroban. There's a saying in commodity land that the cure to high prices is high prices. What that means is that in a traditional commodity cycle, when the price of the commodity goes up, you've created an economic incentive for producers to drill new wells, build new mines, bring new supply in. When that supply comes into the market, ultimately it creates an equilibrium and the price comes down. And what we're seeing this cycle is something that is very different, where not only are the big markets we're investing behind, aluminum, copper, nickel, oil, as examples, in deep structural undersupply today, meaning inventories are drawn, there's already shortages emerging up these commodities. But we're also seeing a lack of a supply response. And why is that? I think there's a few factors that are playing into the inelasticity of supply. One, the most important one is I think the decarbonization and ESG backdrop, where governments, politicians, key stakeholders, including shareholders, and society at large is uncomfortable with the notion, particularly in energy, that we're going to add new fossil fuel resources. So, shareholders are saying, ""We don't want to invest in energy companies. We want to starve the supply base."" That is having real implications. Banks not lending against E&P companies. And therefore the energy sector is probably the best example of this inelasticity, it's creating supply tightness. Where normally when the price moves up, everybody, the producers are ready to go spend money. This time around because of the government interference, because of differing shareholder and societal pressures, we're not seeing the same supply response. So, I think that's part of it. Part of it is the fear of carbon taxes. A lot of these industries, steel, aluminum, fertilizers are large carbon emitters. We could be stepping into a world, and we can talk more about this, where carbon taxes is a critical driver of the profitability of producers. And right now we don't know what the rules of the carbon tax and quota world are going to look like. On one hand, we have the US with no carbon taxes today and then many industries in Europe are subject to carbon taxes today that are over $100 a ton in Europe. So, producers are hesitant in these carbon intensive, big emitting industries to add new supply because they don't know how the carbon intensity of their product is going to be taxed. So, I think there's an element of it there. I think part of it is just economics. We lived in a major down cycle for the last decade. Use oil as a great example. Less than two years ago, WTI oil was at -$37 a barrel. Today we're at $93. So, there's been $130 move in the oil price in less than two years. Now let's pretend, Patrick, you and I are on the board of Exxon Mobil or Chevron. We're debating. Should we take to FID? Should we commission a project in the deep water, Nigeria, Angola, Guyana?Well, we're not going to get our capital back on that project for probably 10 years. We're going to get no cash flow for 5 years. So, what commodity price should we be budgeting? Should we budget -$37 or should we be budgeting $93? So part of it is returns on capital were depressed. The commodities themselves are incredibly volatile and that's creating angst in the shareholder base, in the management teams, and in the boards, as they're determining what rate of supply growth, how aggressively do they want to attack supply? So, the net of all of this is we're in an environment right now where the global economy's booming. We're hopeful China's coming back after a really weak 2021. We have a very favorable demand backdrop. We think, for certain commodities, that demand backdrop is going to get exceptionally good because of this decarbonization trend. Think of the green commodities, the coppers and the nickels, the aluminums that are going to see demand spike because we're pushing decarbonization initiatives. But generally it's a very favorable demand backdrop and yet we're having major supply challenges here. And our view at Soroban, each commodity's different, but we don't think these supply challenges are going to be rectified in the near term. We think these are potentially decade plus supply challenges in front of us. Patrick: There's an unlimited amount of stuff to dig in on there. So, I'll have to pick and choose carefully, but you mentioned decarbonization as obviously a massive theme here that sits alongside what I would call natural demand. So, I'll define natural demand as the stuff we would want if none of this had any negative externalities. If it was no consequence pumping smoke into the air, we would probably be consuming a lot more fossil fuels because we love consuming energy. So, talk us through how you think about those two things, that natural demand concept sitting next to this massive societal level push towards decarbonization. It would just give us a lesson there. Because I think that drives what we would use in an unconstrained world, but the constraints that you've mentioned that get put on supply, that make us all very murky and uncertain. Eric: So to me, the simplest way to package and answer back to you is electric vehicles and demand for copper. It's the tip of the sword example here. And frankly, there's almost more exciting examples of this. There's examples where the decarbonization demand could be substantially greater. Nickel, cobalt would be examples. But let's stay in copper. So, last year the world sold between four and five million pure electric vehicles. And in a normalized year, we under-produced real end demand for automobiles. Last year we only produced 78 million cars in the world. We probably should have produced 90 million. So, in a normalized basis, electric vehicles had about 5% penetration in 2021. Now most of the aggressive decarbonization forecasts have electric vehicle penetration reaching 30+% by the end of this decade and ultimately plateauing at a number that's 60, 70, 80% in the 2040 type time period.So, we're going to basically take electric vehicle penetration to theoretical demand you’re outlining. Let's say the unconstrained demand, and I would argue it's probably even higher than this, but unconstrained demand means we're going from 5% penetration to 30% by the end of the decade to say 70% by the end of 2040. Now what does that mean for copper? To go from five million cars, four, five million cars per year to roughly 30 and then ultimately 60 as just a general rule of thumb based on our estimates, that demand for copper is going to grow just from electrification by about 3 million metric tons per decade. That's electric vehicle demand, and what that's driven by is the average electric vehicle consumes five to six times more copper than an ICE vehicle. And that's largely to do with the battery and the electrification within the car. So basically, we're going to have a situation, roll it out to 2040, that we estimate about five to six million tons annually of copper are going to go into the development of 60, 70 million electric vehicles per year.Just to frame it, the global copper market today I think is about 24 million tons. So you're talking about a demand spike per decade that's probably somewhere in the low teens percent of current copper demand. Cumulatively over two decades, you're talking about a 20%, maybe 25% spike in demand just coming from electric vehicles. Now we're doing a lot of other electrification, battery stations, the whole grid needs to be rewired. So the real true electrification demand for copper is more than just cars, but cars alone could be consuming a quarter of the world copper.And then the flip side is, I'd mentioned this, 3 of the largest copper mines in the world were developed over 100 years ago. There's been only one of the 10 largest copper mines in the world that's been developed this century since 2020. So you have this situation where supply in the near term is highly inelastic. We’re taking a demand equation globally for copper that typically is like 2%, maybe 3% a year. We're going to add probably a point, maybe two points on top of that due to decarbonization. So we're going to take a commodity that normally demand grew 2% a year. We're now going to ask demand to grow 3% to 4% a year because of electrification, and then we have a backdrop that we've been under investing in copper mines for the last 25 years. The resource base is getting more barren. The regions that were going to develop new copper mines are largely Africa, Peru, and Chile, which have a lot of geopolitical unrest around them. Look at what's happening in Chile right now with their new leftist government. So we have a very, very challenging and largely inelastic supply base, and that's meeting a demand growth that's 2% a year in the base case. I'm not sure that the supply's there to even do that, and now we're going to spike demand because of electrification on top of that. One other data point, Patrick, just using nickel as an example, the numbers are probably 2X to 3X larger than they are in copper. The electrification demand, the spiking, the green spiking if you will, is substantially larger in nickel than it is in copper.  Patrick: In this style of investing, do you have to almost verge into material science research and understanding to know what the potential on streaming substitutes are for things like copper and nickel? Is that something that matters because you said the cure for high prices is high prices? If this gets out of hand enough, the incentive would start to exist to find an alternative solution or something. Is that something you think about or is that just too many steps removed from something that's pretty simple and approachable? Eric: I think you're giving us way too much credit to be candid. It depends. In copper, I don't think we're finding a substitute for copper. Copper is the base of electrification in the world. Now nickel's a different story because the demand for nickel is coming largely from batteries, and what the ultimate composition of batteries in electric vehicles looks like, that's TBD. What we know is nickel's the best electricity conductor. In other words, the more nickel you have in your battery, the better the range is on your electric vehicle. So it should be the winner, but ultimately, if the price of nickel goes up enough, we might be substituting other commodities, like lithium, like phosphate into battery. So I don't want to lead you to believe we're the world's experts on battery composition, we're much more comfortable making the base bet around electrification, and I think copper's probably the best way to play that. But nickel is a really foundational electrical commodity as well, and is likely to be a big winner as part of this theme as well.",2856
199,Eric Mandelblatt - Investing in the Industrial Economy,Component Trends of Decarbonization," Patrick: Let's talk to the other components of this big trend of decarbonization. EVs is like a great visceral, easy to imagine example. What are the other big, chunky ways that this starts to play out as things get closer and closer to the actual customer or consumer of products and services? Is it solar power generation? What are the other big, important categories to explore? Eric: The world has determined that the two big methods for decarbonizing are wind and solar generation, and electric vehicles. Now, there's other paths that we can go down, but I'd say the big two today, the big two tools for decarbonizing the world, are really change out the power generation mix and lean heavier on wind and solar, and then let's ramp electric vehicle penetration from the current 5%.On the wind and solar side, what I think investors are misunderstanding, misinterpreting, is the ramp capacity in wind and solar. And the starting point. The stat we like to use around here is the world is consuming 40 times more fossil fuels than they are consuming wind and solar generation. So if I take all the fuel sources in the world and I throw them into a pie, 82% of that pie is fossil fuels today. That's coal, that's gas, and that's oil. 2% of that pie is wind and solar. Now the remainder is largely hydro and nuclear. We're not really adding capacity in a big way today. So this notion that we're going to just all become Greenies and start putting solar panels on our roofs and building offshore wind farms, that is going to happen to be clear. And we estimate the wind and solar penetration in order to hit the type of net zero targets that the IEA and the United Nations are talking about, wind and solar penetration needs to go from 2% today to roughly 25% over the next 30 years. So the penetration levels are going to go up dramatically, but wind and solar generation are incredibly capital-intensive, putting solar panels on your house. It's like you're prepaying for power for 30 years, and you're paying for all that day one, and then you don't have the fuel cost. Your marginal costs are basically zero.But what that means is, you got to pay a lot of money up front to build that generation, it's major capital intensive. Oh, and by the way, mineral intensive, there's a lot of aluminum, nickel, copper in those solar panels. So our point of view is, of course, the world is going to see wind and solar penetration rise dramatically from the levels we're at right now, but that's going to be a really capital-intensive exercise. It's going to be highly inflationary, because in a lot of cases, you're taking a coal plant that was productive. You're shutting it down and now you have to spend all this money building a wind plant or a solar plant in this place. So you're not adding to productive capacity of the world, you're just taking down your carbon intensity.So our view is, it's going to happen, it's going to take a lot longer. And that base of fossil fuel demand that we're under investing in today, that $500 billion a year of capex that recently has been about $300 billion, there's a long tail there. We think the plateau for oil is much longer, gas is going to continue to grow. Even coal is still growing globally, despite all the decarbonization initiative. So the world cannot switch on a dime from electric vehicles to ICE vehicles. We cannot go to all renewable power and shut down all our fossil fuel generation, because the base of fossil fuels in the global energy mix today is 82%. Patrick: How in the world have we not invested more in nuclear as a technology? Eric: Well, three-mile point. I think it was 1979, but the United States got really scared and it froze the US nuclear industry. I think we've had one plant that's attempted to be built, and I frankly lost track of it over time, but Southern was building a plant, either in South Carolina or Georgia. I don't even think the thing got built, they spent $10, 15, 20 billion. We don't have nuclear engineers in the United States anymore. I think the odds that we're going to see a nuclear renaissance in the United States, I'm personally a seller of that thesis. I think that there's societal pressure against it. The capital costs are through the roof. It's not clear that we have the technology and the implementation capabilities that we can actually build this stuff. Now China, India, it's a different story in the rest of the world. Look at the challenges France is having right now in their nuclear industry. I mean, they are in some ways the world's leader in that vertical and they're really struggling to run their plants right now. It's part of the energy shortage that's occurring in Europe that I'm happy to talk about, but I don't see nuclear coming to the rescue here, at least during this decade. Maybe there's a bull case to be had 10+ years out, but between now and then, we're going to need a lot of fossil fuels. Patrick: If we could tread now to start for this specific theme of decarbonization, map this back to investing decisions and equities specifically, and the perspective for good returns, we've talked in my favorite way about what's going on in the world. Oftentimes, markets are good at pricing stories, right? And market prices accurately reflect what the future might look like. Talk to me a little bit about how companies behind these commodities operate, how they trade, what are the systems of these companies themselves so that we can understand why an investment thesis in this area might make sense or might not? Eric: Can I take you off on a tangent and start with a plug for US railroads? Patrick: Of course. Eric: And then I'm happy to come back to the commodity side, which is a little bit more exciting and more volatile, But the picks and shovels, the royalty company sitting on top of this resurgence of industrial production, the reshoring of manufacturing in the US. We're building all these semi plants. We have huge decarbonization initiatives. We're going to be building LNG plants, chemical plants, aluminum plants on the Gulf coast. The picks and shovels way to get leverage to this from our perspective is the US railroads, oligopoly in the east with CSX and NSC, out west with Burlington and UNP, and then up in Canada with CP and CNI. And the railroads are very industrial production levered businesses, US industrial production undergrew US GDP by 20 percentage points over the last decade. I think we're due for a catch up.Look at US housing as a good example of that. We're probably short 5 million homes in the United States. So think of the stuff that's going into a house, cement, steel, alumina, all that stuff's riding on the railroads tracks. So we think the railroads are going to see a real, almost volume dividend, the shipment dividend this decade. Their shipments, their carload growth is going to look very differently this decade than it did the last decade. They are also huge beneficiaries of decarbonization trends, because a rail consumes a quarter of the fuel of a truck on a per ton mile basis. So if I'm Alcoa and I'm shipping aluminum out of the back end of my smelter, and I want to take down my Scope 3 emissions, a good way to do that is less truck, more rail. So I think there's a broader decarbonization shipment benefit that's going to accrue to the rails as we start thinking and talking more about Scope 3 emissions, but the best thing about the rails are they're oligopolies. They price their product up 3% to 4% every year, and the businesses generate tremendous free cashflow.So all that free cashflow comes back to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. Just to kind of frame it, these are companies that historically were growing EBIT without volume growth – were growing EBIT 8%, 9%, 10% a year, largely driven by pricing operating leverage. And now we think not only is that algorithm in place, but they're going to get a volume dividend, so the EBIT growth could be faster. And then these are businesses at 5% free cashflow yields, so you get to pay dividends and buy your shares back 5% a year plus you get to re-leverage all the growth. So you really get 6 points of capital return per year. We haven't built one in 150 years. They're the definition of a long-dated infrastructure asset. They're priced at 5% free cashflow yields, and they're about to go into almost like an industrial production super cycle, decarbonization super cycle that creates massive tailwinds for their businesses. So that's a big theme we have here at Soroban. We've been investing in these companies back to my prior firm for over 15 years. And these are our sleep well at night, earn really good return type businesses. ",2003
200,Eric Mandelblatt - Investing in the Industrial Economy,The Future of Railroads," Patrick: I'd love to understand a bit more about rail networks. I realize I know literally zero about what they look like, where they are? Literally what the capacity is and whether or not you think we'll be building new rail network systems in the next 20 years. Pick your time to just teach me a little bit about that. I know nothing about railroads. Eric: Well, let me say this, we're not building freight railroads, which is what we're talking about. Could we build a passenger railroad? Sure. Patrick: And those are different tracks, different systems? Eric: Different systems. Our end markets here are aluminum, steel, lumber, paper and forest products. Some degree of the UPS, Amazon stuff that's in containers. Coal used to be a big end market, used to be. When I started covering the industry, a quarter of the industry's revenue was shipping coal. Today that's high single digit percentage of revenue, because we've shuttered so much coal fire generation capacity in the United States. So there's not a lot of coal leverage, but it's big heavy industry. It's basically what's moving on railroad networks. This is John Rockefeller 101. We've got two in the east, two in the west, two up north. They're oligopolies, the networks today. The Canadian rails are largely at full capacity. So in order to grow, they need to spend money, they need to add capacity to their network, expand their plant, expand their tracks, expand their siding. What we like about the US railroads, are they're actually shipping less product today than they were 15 years ago.Part of that's driven by coal, part of that's driven by the fact their service product has been so bad. They've bled customers to trucks, but we look at CSX and UNP as having the most operating leverage. We think that their tracks are running 70 something percent capacity factor. So these are businesses, just to frame it, like our biggest position is Microsoft. It would probably surprise you when I tell you CSX and Union Pacific have higher EBIT margins than Microsoft, which we view as the best gold standard software business in the world. These are businesses that are running, in kind of a down cycle right now, at low to mid 40% EBIT margins. So their EBITDA less capex margins are over 40% today. We think, as the networks get more loaded and they take more pricing, that the EBIT margins are headed to 50%. And EBIT is a rough proxy for EBITDA less capex.So these are world class businesses. I mean, to have 40+%, 50% EBIT margins, this is like the Microsoft, the Visas, the MasterCards of the world. So many of your listeners love these businesses and capitalize them at very high multiples, appropriately so. Railroads are trading at 18 to 20 times this year's earnings, with this incredible margin structure where their shipment volumes are actually down over the last 15 years. And I think they have a lot of upside leverage to the resurgence in US industrial production and the decarbonization initiatives we've talked about. And we're definitively not building more of them, given NIMBY issues. You really can't build anything in this country. These tracks were laid 150, 175 years ago. Patrick: Can you explain NIMBY issues, just what that means specifically? Eric: Yeah. Yeah. Not in my backyard. Meaning, given how developed the country is at this point, Union Pacific can't raise their hands and say, ""Hey, we'd love to run a railroad track through downtown Houston."" It doesn't work like that. So the tracks are the tracks. We're not laying new tracks here. And at my old firm we used to talk about what are the businesses we'd be comfortable buying a 100-year bond from? Because it's almost the definition of incumbency, barriers to entry longevity. To me, the railroads are my number one. When I think about what's a business I know a hundred years from now, that business is going to be around, it's going to be cash flowing. Very hard to say that, very hard to look 100 years in the future. To me, railroads are the definition of the 100-year asset. And by the way, they're one of the very few 100-year bond issuers in the United States market. They have 100-year bonds that yield 4% today. Patrick: I really like that idea. And if you think about what markets are supposed to do when they price a security, to assign terminal value, discount cash flow into the future with something that is so potentially stable. Why are markets pricing them at the levels you just quoted, relative to technology businesses? Let's say that have way more disruption risk than something like you just described. What explains that gap? Eric: I would say that I think it's largely driven by the lack of volumetric shipment growth that they've exhibited over the last 20 years. So the margins went from 10% to 40%, even with no shipment volume growth. That's being driven by pricing and productivity, but the market's fixated with top line. And when you look back and you say, ""Well, wait, they haven't grown."" They're growing top line via price, but they haven't grown top line at all via volumes. So they look a little bit tobacco-esque in that sense. I think that's totally the wrong analogy to be clear, because if you decompose the historical volume algorithm, what you're going to see is, basically, a lot of the lack of volume growth is driven by coal. And coal production in the United States, I don't know the exact numbers, it's down 70% in the last 15 years. We're at the tail end of coal. And frankly, the coal we're producing here is largely metallurgical coal, which is going into the steel making business or being exported. So that base is probably going to stay around. So the rails have fought through three things. One, coal, two, US industrial production hasn't grown for a decade, that's their end market so that's created a headwind for them. And then three, candidly, their service product has stunk. They've not been a good partner to their shipment customers because this was a country club business, and you were a monopoly, oligopoly service provider and you didn't need to provide good service, because you knew your base load of volume. The only way that you were going to move the coal was via rail. You can't move it versus truck, it's so inefficient. I'm using coal as an example there. So a lot of these heavy industries are heavily reliant on rail. So the rail would show up when it wants to show up and you'd never know when your product was being delivered, and they burned a lot of goodwill with customers over the last 20 years. And part of our thesis is, that that was the last 20 years, the next 10 years are going to look very different because the management teams have changed out. The philosophy on how to run these railroads has changed. This is the Hunter Harrison phenomenon. I don't know if you're familiar with Hunter, but he brought in operating discipline to this industry. He was the original, I'd say, productivity enhancer in the railroad business. Unfortunately he passed away a number of view years ago, but he went in, he took control of Canadian National, 20 something years ago when they were privatized and they had 0% EBIT margin. Today the business has a 40% EBIT margin. And just putting in place principles on how you run your trains, how you interact with customers, how you enhance productivity of your network. And ultimately that accrues to the benefit of the customer because they're getting a better service product. So in order to be right on our thesis, these volumes are really going to start to structurally grow 3% or 4% a year. It's going to require the rails to actually care about their customers and interact with them in a more sensible way than they have historically. When they tell you the train's coming at 10:00 AM, show up at 10:00 AM.Just to kind of conclude, we talked a lot about revenues and EBIT. I just want to mention capital return because I think our view of stock buybacks versus stock issuance is something that investors are not being thoughtful about. In the technology world, there's a lot of excluding stock-based compensation math that's going on. And sorry to bring the bad news, stock-based compensation is an expense, and valuing companies ex-stock-based compensation to me doesn't make a lot of sense. It's very 1999-esque. The inverse of that is the rails. You're basically buying back, paying dividends, at a rate of 5% to 6% of your market cap, maybe 7% per year. So just think about this over a decade. Based on our numbers, we estimate CSX will capital return 90% of its current market cap, directionally it's a $70-something-billion market cap company, 90% of that is coming back to shareholders in the next 10 years via dividends and buybacks. For Union Pacific the number's probably closer to 80%. So think about how that is de-risking your investment here. Because every year it's almost like a coupon on a bond. You know you're getting 5, 6, 7 points of capital return per year. And when you compound that out over a decade with growth, you basically are dramatically buying down your capital structure in these companies. Patrick: Just to play the other side, just to make sure we're thorough here, if I was the world's biggest bear on these companies, does it mostly just come down to overall economic growth and being bearish on that? Because it seems like obviously these things would ride demand growth generally, GDP growth generally, is that sort of the other side of this story potentially? Eric: Yeah, I think you would say, ""One, I'm bearish on industrial production. They're economically levered. Two, a high single-digit percent of revenues are coal."" Most people think that's going to zero. I think that's wrong because of met coal and exports, but you'd say coal. And then you'd say, ""Three, I hear you about the shipment growth, but they haven't done it historically. They've historically been poorly run businesses. And therefore, while the theoretical market opportunity is in front of them, the TAM is large, they're not going to be able to attack that TAM because their service product stinks.""",2317
201,Eric Mandelblatt - Investing in the Industrial Economy,How a Commodities Business Operates," Patrick: All right, so maybe we could shift now into oil, or you pick whichever commodities we want to focus on and the ways in which those businesses differ from rails is a great useful comparison point. Eric: Let me start by saying they don't belong in the same sentence. They're different; they're more different than they are similar. Ultimately they're both economically-leveraged, commodities much more so than railroads, but ultimately they're industrial economy, global economic growth-levered assets. We have to go commodity by commodity. I use the copper example where I think probably the barriers to entry, when I think about commodity markets, are probably highest in copper. It's the hardest to add supply because the mines are really old, it takes 10-plus years, you have all this resource nationalism at play. So we might want to talk about how electric vehicle manufacturers are going to, in my opinion, backward integrate to the mine. They're going to need to secure their nickel and copper. Elon Musk can't just wake up and say, ""I'm going to develop a copper mine, a nickel mine."" These are really long lead-time projects.Now, on the other hand, you would have US shale, which is the shortest supply response where the time to drill and spud a well is some number of days, to weeks, to months, but you can get a pretty quick supply response. Now US shale in the oil market is only a low teens percent of the global oil market, but that's an example of a very short cycle commodity that probably has a very low barrier to entry. You just need to own the resource base.And then you have stuff in the middle, like I would say aluminum, fertilizers, the markets are very tight and we're not seeing supply being added, but ultimately with enough capital and a three, four year timeline, new supply can be added into those markets. So on one hand, the coppers, nickels, some of the mine commodities, probably highest barriers to entry. US shale, US natural gas, lowest. And then some of the processed commodities like chemicals, like aluminum, like steel, are somewhere in between where lead times are probably anywhere between two and five years. Patrick: If I wanted to compare businesses within commodity industry, how do you do that? Like how much differentiation is there both from a stock ownership shareholder perspective and also from a customer perspective producer? Because I think about oil, it's this fungible thing, you're a price taker, like there's some lousy features. In the same way you highlight the great features of the railroads, there's some really lousy features structurally of an oil business. How do you think about Exxon versus Chevron, or the differing nature as you're building a portfolio of individual securities, not just buying like a sector ETF or something, what do you think about that? Eric: Each commodity is different, but you're correct. These are capital-intensive, they're cyclical businesses, and you're price takers. It's not a railroad that you get three to four points of price. So you have to start with understanding the commodity market itself. If you're going to invest in steel equities, you have to have a point of view on the steel cycle, and the consolidation that's happening in North America, or fertilizers, aluminum, copper, et cetera. The interesting thing today, this is an overly generic comment, is almost every market we're looking at is in deep structural undersupply, and we have this issue around inelasticity around supply. And then in some commodities we're seeing spiking demand. It's a backdrop I've never witnessed during my career where you have the starting point today – we could talk individuals, aluminum, copper, nickel, zinc, oil, fertilizers – deep structural under supply, real tightness in the underlying commodities, inventories drawing significantly to razor tight levels.So that's the starting point. And then let's talk supply and demand. Demand? Global economy's booming. It's booming with China largely having been on its back in 2021. Now the US is going to slow. So I think there's going to be a bit of a handoff between the US and China, but overall, US nominal GDP is growing, I think grew 12% in 4Q. So we have a pretty strong backdrop of demand. Plus we're going to get the decarbonization spike in the coppers, and the nickels, and the aluminums. And then on the supply side, we have this inelasticity, the shareholder activism, the resource nationalism that we're not seeing the supply response. So it's this incredible cocktail, again, that I've never seen of deep, deep under supplied markets today, lack of immediate supply growth, and a demand picture that's actually quite favorable. Oh, and then we can talk about carbon taxes, which is going to throw this whole system in whack, because carbon's in everything we consume, and certain end markets that are very carbon-intensive – aluminum, cement, fertilizers as an example – if the world moves to a carbon quota system, if the world becomes Europe, it's going to throw cost curves completely out of whack. And there's going to be certain producers, I'd highlight Alcoa in aluminum as an example of this, that are going to make windfall profits for a decade plus because of the new carbon tax regime. So it's an incredible cocktail in front of us right now. Patrick: You mentioned Alcoa, it seems like a really interesting opportunity to dig in on one example of how all this stuff might affect a fairly simple and recognizable business. Most people have probably heard of Alcoa. I like the description you gave of Alcoa to me one time, which is that it's the physical manifestation or derivation of energy as a concept placed into a physical product. So walk us through Alcoa's business, just at a high level, and how these exogenous things like carbon taxes, like the carbon scene that you've just painted, might affect an individual business like this. Eric: That's great. So what do they do? They make aluminum. They make over 2 million tons of aluminum per year. They're roughly a 3% supplier into the global market. Now they were the biggest aluminum supplier in the world 20 years ago. So what happened in aluminum? I think it's an illustrative, a good illustrative market. The Chinese woke up 20 years ago, they said, ""We have all this cheap coal, let's turn it into power. What do we do with the power? Well, let's make aluminum. Let's make fertilizers. These are really power-intensive, energy-intensive commodities. And let's export that all over the world."" So what happened? 20 years ago they essentially had no domestic aluminum industry. Today they're almost 50% of the global aluminum supply. It's amazing. They destroyed the aluminum business. Their very cheap, but very dirty and carbon-intensive coal, they turned it into aluminum, and they exported it all over the world. And if you were a developed world producer, if you were Rio Tinto, they own Alcan, if you're Alcoa, they destroyed your business. And we lived in a 15 year down cycle in the aluminum business. Now what's different this time? Well, China's woken up and they've said, ""Wait a second, the world doesn't like us emitting all this carbon, we're destroying our environment, we're making no money making this aluminum, maybe we should not continue to grow our domestic aluminum supply."" And they've created a cap, the global market's 70 million tons of aluminum, and they've created a cap, I think it's at 45 million tons, and they've said, ""We're just not going to build smelters beyond that. We're ultimately going to reduce our reliance on aluminum smelting as a country."" The problem is there's no one taking the handoff, because Alcoa's not building new smelters, Rio Tinto's not building new smelters. And the backdrop, aluminum's one of the highest demand growth commodities, pre-decarbonization, and it's a major decarbonization winner. So we've got a demand backdrop that's going to grow 4% or 5% a year, the Chinese were more than supplying all of that for the last 15 years, and now they've said, ""Well, we're capping out supply."" So what's going to happen? In our opinion, you're already seeing the inventory draws. What's going to happen is the world's going to be short aluminum.So let me give you the Alcoa examples here. Let's put aside carbon taxes, we'll come back to that. Aluminum's at $3,200 per ton today. At $3,200 aluminum, Alcoa's generating low teens EPS per share, no capital allocation, the business has zero debt at the end of the year. So just looking at the EBIT, dropping it to net income, they're doing $12, $13 of earnings and free cash per share; the stocks at $70. The business being valued at six times free cash flow. So that's like a 17% unlevered free cash flow yield at $3,200 aluminum. But two things. Number one, I think prices are going up. Tthe best commodity forecasters nobody can do it well, none of us know exactly where commodity prices are going to land, the best commodity forecasters out there are Jeff Currie's group at Goldman Sachs. They're carrying $3,850 aluminum price forecasts for 2022, and ultimately rising to a $5,000 aluminum price, I think it's in 2024. At $5,000 aluminum, Alcoa is doing $27 per share of free cash flow. And by the way, that's before capital allocation. The share count's coming down dramatically, because they're sweeping cash now. So you have a business that's being valued at $72 per share that ultimately is probably going to generate somewhere between $10 and $30 a share of earnings and free cash in the next few years.You don't need a lot of $20 per share of free cash flow to eat very quickly into what's a $73 stock that has no leverage. In three or four years this company has no market cap if they're paying dividends and buying back stock at the rate that we anticipate. And then on top of that, we have a point of view, it's not happening tomorrow, it might be a 10+ year journey, but ultimately the world's going to move to a carbon quota, carbon tax system. We're not going to let the Chinese dump dirty steel, dirty aluminum, dirty fertilizers, nitrogen, phosphate in the United States and not tax it for the carbon intensity. If you think about it, the average smelter in China today is emitting 16 to 17 metric tons of carbon per ton of aluminum produced. Alcoa's corporate average is 4.3. So take 16 minus 4. Alcoa is emitting 12 metric tons less carbon per ton of aluminum produced. So if we taxed carbon at $100 per ton, we're already taxing it higher in Europe, that basically means that the marginal producer is getting priced up by the 12 tons, that's $1,200 lower on the carbon cost curve that Alcoa is versus the Chinese. The Chinese are half the world's aluminum. They are the marginal producer. $1,200 per ton of P&L for Alcoa is almost doubling what their P&L was in 2021. Said differently, to make it a per-share metric, $100 carbon tax is $8 per share of added earnings power at Alcoa. This is the mega bull case if I just take the Goldman tax $5,000 price forecast, that's $27 a share free cash flow, I add an $8 per share from a carbon tax, This is ridiculous to even say, but there's no doubt Alcoa is going to earn over $20, maybe over $30 per share before the share count comes down, so all the per share math is going to get better over time as well. So we look at that as a great thematic beneficiary, structural undersupply, demand's growing strongly driven by decarbonization. And then the cherry on top is the optionality around carbon taxes.

202,Eric Mandelblatt - Investing in the Industrial Economy,Investing Through Uncertainty," Patrick: I'd love to hear your take, it's such a fascinating thing to think through, on the nature of uncertainty in the world of commodities. I remember reading Twilight in the Desert and being obsessed with all things oil for a long time, and reading about peak demand, and peak supply, and all these things. And it just seems, you just literally said it, almost nobody can forecast any of this stuff, weird technology changes, shale comes online, geopolitical things heat up. There's just all this complex stuff that happens that affects these things. How do you think about that? Is it just something that requires a bigger margin of safety? A lower entry price? Like what is the portfolio manifestation of the fact that this stuff has been basically impossible to forecast historically? Eric: I think you nailed it. First of all, we're playing a directional game. Is aluminum going to $5,000? Is it going to $4,000? Is it going to $35,000? We don't know. There's false precision there. So you're playing a directional game. What do supply and demand balances look like? Directionally, where do you see prices going? But you're absolutely right, you just need a larger margin of safety. We're not making the argument that a commodity producer is Microsoft or Union Pacific, they're not. But I would make the argument if I own Alcoa here, put aside the upside optionality in prices, if I own the stock for the next five to six years, 100% of my market cap, 100% of my enterprise value is coming back to me in terms of dividends and buybacks, I'm dramatically de-risking the investment. And then we have a point of view that prices are actually going higher. So that's a long-winded way of saying it's a directional game. It's about getting your entry point right in the equities and make sure that they're embedding a low price forecast that you think there's a lot of asymmetry. What I happen to like right now is one, all the producers largely, I'm exaggerating a bit, but all the producers, are running with virtually zero leverage on the balance sheet. So what really kills you in a commodity business is when the cycle goes against you and you're really levered. No one's levered because we just lived through a 10 year down cycle. The windfall profits we're realizing today have gone to healing the balance sheets. So there's really no knockout risk, A.B, we got this dramatic enterprise value buydown that's happening via this free cashflow generation. The windfall profits that we think are here to stay are basically coming back to you, they're dividends, they're buybacks, or they're deleveraging. And the other point I would just make about volatility is I think volatility is our friend in these markets from this point forward. Historically it's our foe because it could knock us out, because you were running with a lot of leverage, if the cycle goes against you got real problems. And I think it's our friend right now that, use my oil example, -$37 to $93, it's helping create this inelastic supply. The volatility is scaring capital off. It means that investors don't want these companies investing in long lead time projects. Look at fossil fuels. The largest private equity firms in the world, even in their energy funds, are not allowed to allocate money to fossil fuels. So the volatility is scarring the investor base, scarring the capital provider, and adding to this uncertainty around supply growth, this inelasticity of supply that we've been talking about. Patrick: When you study all of this, you don't have to go far before you start digging into geopolitical entanglements and fascinating brinksmanship, we're living through it right now with Russia and the Ukraine. We've seen lots of examples of Western Europe being very reliant on other geographies for their energy supply and production. You’ve studied this a lot more than anyone I've talked to, what is your view of the world right now? What are the big things maybe that we have haven't talked about yet that are interesting to you, that matter to you, not just as an investor, but just as an observer of everything that's going on? Eric: Right, so framing comment, it's a really risky geopolitical world. Own commodities. It's your friend, it'll squeeze supply. Just a simple example though. We've been talking about in the last week, the potash industry, very, very specialized industry, 70 million metric tons globally. Two of the biggest producers in the world are Belarus and Russia. If the Russians invade Ukraine and the Western world is sanctioning these facilities, ultimately the world's going to be massively short potash, and then you can own a developed world producer like a Mosaic or a Nutrient that's going to benefit from that. But I'd say overall across the energy, the food supply chain, even in industries like aluminum, the geopolitical risk ironically is probably your friend as a developed world producer today.Part two, I would just say, to me, the canary in the coal mine – this is around heavy industry, it's kind of the energy and mining complex – is Europe. The lesson that we just learned this winter that the Europeans push very high renewable penetration. In fact, they're at the 20-+% renewable penetration that we talked about the world getting to in 30 years, they're there today. And what did they do? They're trying to shut their domestic gas industry. They shut nuclear reactors down. Look at what the Germans are doing. They shuttered coal fire generation capacity. They leaned very hard on renewables. And then what happened though? The wind didn't blow. They didn't get the generation from the renewables, and they're shutting down their nukes right now.So at the end of the day, they've had to increase their imports from Russia. Putin's not giving them the gas, and we've seen prices skyrocket, really spiral out of control. We, in December, had over $50 per MMbtu natural gas prices in Europe, when in the US the corresponding price was $4. So think about the competitive disadvantage heavy industries have in Europe. And then this has the knock-on effect of what are the big industries that consume a lot of power? It's aluminum smelters, it's nitrogen plants, it's zinc smelters. So we've seen those mine commodities, chemical industries have to shut down because they don't have enough power in Europe. And that's kind of created a cycle in the mine commodities and chemicals. This is all circular.So my big takeaway is Europe was the canary in the coal mine, they were the grand experiment around renewables. They were by far the deepest into the renewables penetration curve, and literally the wind didn't blow and it all came unravelling. So to me, if I was a policy maker, I would be trying to learn lessons from Europe. And I think the key lesson is that the amount of time and effort and capital it takes to wean yourself off fossil fuels is just a lot greater than probably the world anticipates. We're not going to flick a light switch here and be able to wean ourselves off of gas, coal, and oil. It's a much longer and more capital-intensive process than I think folks realize.And let me just give you one stat behind that. There's been a number of studies, B of A, Goldman, McKinsey just came out with one that estimate that the trend to net zero, the decarbonization initiatives are a roughly $100 trillion to $150 trillion capital need for the world over the next 30 years. We're talking about $3, 4, 5 trillion per year. I think that shows you one, it takes a lot of money, it's inflationary, but two, it takes a lot of time as well. And it's just not clear to me that the world has the natural resource base, ironically – the aluminum, the copper, the nickels of the world – to actually the pivot at the speed and intensity that the IEA and the United Nations are talking about. Patrick: How do you think about inflation as an investor in this space? I'll keep the question very simple there. Eric: To me, I look at our commodity exposure almost as an inflationary hedge across our portfolio. Most of the businesses, to be clear, that we're investing in, I think have a lot of pricing power and their nominal profit dollars are going to go up in a higher inflationary world. So I'm not overly concerned about the impact inflation has, at least in earnings power. The multiples may come down, but commodities are one of the few sectors that are positively correlated to rising inflation. Higher inflation is a good thing for their businesses. And that's part of the reason why their businesses didn't do so well over the last 10+ years. But inflation is our friend here. The best example I give is if you're a steel producer, you would think. ""Oh no, scrap prices are going up, iron ore prices are going up, met coal prices."" These are the input into your process. ""If the prices of those inputs are going up, that's a bad thing for me."" It turns out that steel prices are highly correlated, the spreads, the margins these companies generate is highly correlated to steel pricing and input cost. So the more iron ore goes up, the more money a US steel ultimately is going to make over time. Clearly in oil, yeah, there's going to be some cost inflation, but ultimately, you're pulling for higher inflation. You're pulling for higher prices over time.",2094
203,Eric Mandelblatt - Investing in the Industrial Economy,Utopian and Dystopian Models of Growth," Patrick: So much of what we talked about is economic linkage between these securities and what happens in real growth around the world. Maybe, again, with your unique set of perspectives and insight into companies that you're positioned in, walk me through a spectrum from utopian to dystopian. So go to two extremes and describe what a utopian version of growth looks like for the world, and then maybe we'll start with dystopian so we can end on a higher note. What is the dystopian version? And then we'll talk about utopian. Eric: Ultimately, these commodities are levered to industrial production. And I would just double click on that and say certain commodities, aluminum and steel are the best example of this, are particularly leveraged to Chinese industrial production. The property market, the infrastructure market. The scale of the infrastructure build out in China over the last 20 years is mind boggling. China's consuming almost 10 times the amount of steel the United States is consuming today. Our GDP is bigger than China. So at the end of the day, there's a big industrial production bet and there's a particularly big bet that the Chinese industrial production, the property market, the infrastructure market, are going to hold in there. So last year looked like a good year in terms of global demand growth, ex-China. China was on its back. I'm sure you've read a lot about the property market there. One of the things that makes us excited about this year is we think we're going to have a US to China handoff. The US is going to slow, China's going to accelerate. But particularly in commodities like aluminum, steel, there's a huge China overlay bet. When we talk about global industrial production, we have to be like global industrial production plus China because China is just such a big part of the mix. Now, with something like oil, China's consuming a teens, low teens percent of global oil demand so they have less of an impact there. That's the 50% in steel is the 10%% to 15% in oil. So it depends on the commodity. But at the end of the day, higher growth, higher inflation, those are things you're rooting for as a commodity investor. Patrick: We might just say whatever promotes, generally speaking, industrial production in those key two couple of areas is good. Anything that massively impairs it is bad. We don't know what those things are going to be. We can't forecast it. But that's sort of the driver. Eric: Agree. And my one added cherry on top is decarbonization because decarbonization isn't adding, in a lot of cases, productivity capacity. But we're literally shutting down the old, replacing it with the new, and not adding productivity. That's a phenomenon we've never seen before. Normally, when you have a productive asset, you don't shut it down and build a new one. Because of decarbonization trends, we are doing that and that's creating what we expect to be a multi-decade decarbonization kicker to global industrial production. Patrick: Just because it is a third of your portfolio and it's so different, juxtapose for us the positions you do have in big tech against this industrial story. Sorry for the 180 switcharoo, but we talked about, I'll call it, two-thirds of the portfolio or so in great detail. Everyone knows the four names you mentioned that represent big tech that you already referenced earlier in the conversation. Switch mental models for me and bring us through the logic that the same investing team and mind leads to this conclusion that's owned big tech alongside this other stuff. Eric: We own Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet. To me, the Microsoft and Alphabet piece is actually pretty simple, which is whether it's Google search or whether it's almost every part of Microsoft, these incredible incumbency, massive barrier to entry, high margin, high growth businesses, we're paying some version of a market multiple for it. It's a head scratcher to me. It's kind of the gift that keeps giving. In some ways, we wish the stocks massively rerated, but the fact that they haven't means we just stay here and we're allowed to get the 20% rolls every year. We look at an Alphabet and you make just very small adjustments, the $150 billion of cash they have, maybe some adjustments on their other bet losses like Waymo, maybe some adjustments on GCP, you're buying the core of their search and YouTube business for maybe slightly above a mid-teens multiple, 16-, 17-times 2023 earnings. If it's not the best business in the world, it's got to be in the top five.So to me, it's almost easy. Why would we not be there? Why would we not have a big position? The world loves software. But on our numbers, CY23, Microsoft's trading at 22-times earnings. It's the best software business in the world. To us, that has to be a big part of what we're doing. Those of positions combined are over 20% of our capital base today, 20% to 25%. I think Amazon's more complicated in some ways, but it's probably got more right tail gearing in the sense our view is AWS is downside bounding us. We run 10-year DCF models on AWS. We think that business is worth some version of $1.5 trillion, and Amazon's market cap is slightly above that today, enterprise value's slightly above that. And then we got to pick through the retail business.And what I say to our investors, and they look at me like I have four eyes, is the single most misunderstood business in our portfolio today is Amazon retail. And I would just frame it this way. The street consensus is underwriting businesses doing $600+ billion of GMV. And if you look at the EBIT that the street and investors are largely anticipating, it implies that this is a 1% EBIT to GMV margin business. That's what's embedded in consensus forecast. And we just think there's massive high margin revenue streams here at the ads business, the subscription business, that ultimately, we think that Amazon retail, they're massively massively investing. You've probably seen the stats on the square footage growth, all the logistics capacity. They have more logistics capacity today than UPS and FedEx have. The scale of what they're doing is absolutely incredible, but it's really burdening the P&L.And we kind of look out a few years and we say, where do we think margins are going to be on this business? And our personal view is we're heading into the mid singles. And ultimately, this is a business that should have the capacity to generate at scale 10% EBIT margins. It's at 1% today. And we just think that the runway of growth around the retail business and the ultimate profitability is dramatically greater than probably the average investor. And if you believe that and you start looking at the look-through profitability of the business at higher margin structures, Amazon's a very inexpensive stock on our numbers, the stocks at mid-20s-times CY23 earnings, and we're underwriting about a 4% EBIT margin. We don't think that's the ultimate landing point. So we think there's a lot of look through profitability on the retail business that's going to be unleashed in coming years. And the dominance this company has in retail, we think they're going to destroy the Walmarts, the Targets of the world. The logistics capacity, the infrastructure they built, we love the moat around the business, and we think it's going to be one of the great 5- to 10-year compounders in our portfolio. Patrick: When we started this, we said before hitting record, it'd be fun to make this conversation basically zeroed out on frameworks and philosophy and all in on detail and nuance and even individual companies. This has been so much fun to structure the conversation just this way. I've learned a ton. And I think the theme itself of industrials, industrial production, commodities has been one that is fascinating, but just largely ignored by investment dollars, by commentary, as positions in portfolios. So this has been a totally different and really fun episode. I always ask everybody the same traditional closing question. What is the kindest thing that anyone's ever done for you? Eric: Before I answer, let me just thank you again, Patrick. Really enjoyed the conversation. Specific to your question, the guy that gave me the shot in this business. So we didn't get into this, but I grew up in south Florida, I went to the University of Florida, and never thought I'd get a shot on Wall Street. I sent out 400 resumes in the fall of 1997 hoping somebody would call me back. I got two callbacks; both were from Goldman Sachs, on the investment banking side and the equity research side. And I ended up interviewing with the lead natural gas analyst, an MD at Goldman Sachs, David Fleischer. And he took a liking to me. He mentored me. He hired me, most importantly. I believe I was the first analyst hired in my class, the 1998 analyst class. And it was really David saw something in me. He gave me a shot. I didn't think I'd have the opportunity to be at Goldman coming from the public school background. But David really leaned in. He took a liking to me, he mentored me, and I'm forever grateful for that. Unfortunately, he passed away about two years ago. But David was just a huge inspiration to me and he gave me my shot. And all I can do is say, thank you. Patrick: What did he do well that could serve as almost advice for others that want to do that same function for people entering this world today? What did the good parts of that feel like to be mentored, have someone take you under their wing like that? Eric: It was a painful exercise, I'll be candid. David was tough. He was tough, but fair. He was always very transparent with me, very candid with me. And I remember he used to have a sofa in his office. I'd get the phone call, ""Come see me."" And I was like, I got a problem here. And he would basically sit down next to me, and frankly, I'm not a good writer and that was something I struggled with, and he would just sit down and he would literally edit line by line with me and explain to me the logic, the thought process on why he didn't like the way I was writing. And he was persistent with it. So I think the combination of a true rooted desire to make me better, he invested his time, his effort, his mentorship in me, and he was very consistent and persistent in doing that. I'm still not a good writer, but I think he kind of got me over the hump and allowed me to excel in areas thankfully outside of writing that I was probably stronger with. Patrick: Love that. What a cool place to close. Hope everyone listening can do this for somebody else out there. It's the single most consistent answer we get is someone that took a chance early on, played that mentorship role early on when they didn't need to is pretty powerful. So really great closing advice, Eric. Thanks so much for your time. Eric: Thank you, Patrick.This site uses cookies to improve your browsing experience.

204,Sebastian Kanovich - Powering Emerging Markets Payments,Introduction," Patrick: My guest today is Sebastian Kanovich, CEO of payments company dLocal. Sebastian founded dLocal in 2016 to bridge the infrastructure gap between payments in developed and emerging markets. Since then the initially bootstrap startup has enabled global merchants like Uber, Spotify, and Google to service billions of emerging market users. And in doing so dLocal has created 10 billion of equity market value having IPOed last year, our discussion covers dLocal's playbook for facilitating payments in emerging countries, what Sebastian's learned about great API building and how he challenges himself to improve personally. Please enjoy my conversation with Sebastian Kanovich.",133
205,Sebastian Kanovich - Powering Emerging Markets Payments,The Global Payments Landscape," Patrick: Sebastian, I've been really looking forward to this conversation because I am so fascinated with the world of payments. It's this massive thing that everybody uses every day that is unspeakably complex in its guts and in a world that's increasingly global dLocal sits in a fascinating position in this world. So I think the right place to begin would actually be with the present day and survey your take on global payments. What is interesting about that system to you today and the role that you play in it? Sebastian: First of all, thanks very much for having me. It's great to be here. Payments has become exciting. It wasn't this way when we started. From day one, I always felt the same, payments it's not rocket science by no means, but it works, but it's sometimes broken on the edges. And what we've seen is that things that people give for granted in places like the U.S., Europe, even China, that a user can go and buy from a company and that company can go and pay for that user, it's not the case when you are sitting in Nigeria or when you're sitting in India or when you're sitting in Brazil. So if anything, we've seen that people are demanding more and more use cases that require international payments, but those payments are completely broken. And they're not broken because there's something fundamentally broken about it. It's more about building infrastructure, making sure that those pipes connect to each other.The other thing we've seen more and more is that payments are a very local trend. So if you're a user sitting in South Africa, you have a very different behavior from the user sitting in Mexico or from the user sitting in India. And if anything, we are seeing that becoming more and more localized. While that's great news for the user, because now I can go and pay with whatever payment method I want, it's very challenging from a merchant, from a company perspective, because sadly you need to accept hundreds if not thousands of payment methods. So what we've seen or what gets me excited and what keeps me going is there's a problem that shouldn't be broken fundamentally, but it is today. What gets me excited is whenever we fly into a new country and that has happened multiple times, we say, ""Wow, this is a really complex, there're multiple frictions here, we should be solving them."" Patrick: Talk me through an example of a country. What happens when you show up? What you typically see and the playbook that you've created to facilitate lower friction payments in a given country. Sounds like it's idiosyncratic, each country's a little different, but give us a sense of what it feels like to approach somewhere that isn't yet where it could be and what you do to get it there. Sebastian: Typically, when you fly into a new place, first thing you'll see that people pay with whatever local payment method they decided that is relevant. In the case for India, when I was first there, it was cash, then became UPI, which is a state backed payment method. And typically you'll see that infrastructure for local use cases works relatively well. If you are a kiosk and you want to accept UPI, things work relatively okay. If you are a local company and you want to accept UPI things work. The challenge starts when you're a user or you're sitting in India and you want to buy from Spotify or from Netflix or from Google. That's where the friction starts because suddenly those funds need to be exfiltrated to California, to Europe, to China, or the opposite flow, to pay out into a UPI account.All those steps, none of them should be complex on their own, add friction. So what we do is we make sure that infrastructure it's there. Fundamentally we want to make sure that independently of where the user is sitting, our merchants can be able to accept and disperse payments and that should be absolutely transparent. What we do at dLocal it's generally building infrastructure and that's what get us excited in the sense that we have no agenda around the user saying I bought from dLocal. We want the user to say, ""I had a great payments experience in [inaudible] ."" And if we are powering that, that's great news for us.We know how it should look and when it works okay. We know when we go into the market what's broken and we are trying to fill the gaps. If payment methods do not support recurring, which is something we see again and again, this idea of being able to charge the same user systematic. That needs to be fixed. That kills the whole business model for some merchants. So how do we fix those things? Tax reporting, super complex in some of these countries. How do we integrate to the tax authorities to make sure that the right taxes are being paid automatic? Exfiltration of funds, how do we deal with effects in countries which are extremely complex in terms of the currency controls? We are looking to have the building blocks that make commerce happen as it should in the U.S. or in Europe or in China. Patrick: Is it convenient to think about what you're building at the top level as a standard protocol? Any country, your mission would be to roll the stream of information that starts in that local example up to a standard that you've created, so that you're a protocol like business. Sebastian: We are an API business. What we offer our merchants is the ability of navigating all of those complexities under one API. I don't see ourselves as a protocol in the sense that for a protocol, you would assume that there's adoption without the protocol doing any active effort, or you said the standard and then the community built it. That's not the case for us. We need to go and build the pipes into all of these countries. But yes, fundamentally we want to add a level of abstraction from a technology standpoint where no matter where these users are sitting, companies should be able to reach it. The only caveat is that us as a company at dLocal only get excited for emerging markets. We are looking generally at the places where we think this challenge is the most relevant. So you see dLocal in Latin America, which is where we started. You'll see us investing really heavily in Africa, in Southeast Asia, in India, because those are typically the places where this problem we see it's more important and it's more complex. Patrick: What companies handle the solution like you are handling it outside of emerging markets and why didn't those companies go down into the emerging market, given in how massive that space is? Sebastian: Companies like Adyen or Stripe will be serving a very similar role, but in Western Europe or in the U.S. Why they haven't gone to emerging markets, I think it's a great question for them. We do see them coming more and more aggressively. I think there's a few differentiators, one is culture, and I know this sounds super basic, but we started this company out of Uruguay processing payments in Brazil. That has defined two key things. Number one, we come from emerging markets. We were born in countries where things are complex and are tough to navigate. But number two, we never did business in our home country. We didn't operate our business out of Uruguay. The first country we launched was Brazil. So, that got the company very used to this idea of becoming local in the place where we weren't born. That's the first differentiator.The second one, it's a technology. As I was mentioning before, payments is not rocket science. We generally don't see it that way. But building technology for payments in emerging market takes time and takes grit. It's not easy. Regulatory frameworks are complex. Payment methods are sometimes outdated. So it takes a lot of investment, a lot of commitment to these problems. Sometimes when we first go to a market, just like Bangladesh, first time we analyze Bangladesh, we said, ""It's really, really, really complex.""There's two possibilities. One to say, this is impossible. Let's go for Germany, that it's easier. The other answer, which is the one we are committed to is, this is a nightmare, let's go fix it. That process might take three months or might take three years like the case of Bangladesh. And we know that we are going to see the payoff hopefully in five years to come, because that's a very early economy. But we think that infrastructure needs to be laid. This is not a problem to tackle as a me too, or as something else. This needs to be your DNA, if you want to have a chance of being successful. And even if you commit entirely to the problem, you'll know that it's a very complex one and you still take lots of time on investment.",1921
206,Sebastian Kanovich - Powering Emerging Markets Payments,The Infrastructure and APIs Supporting Payments," Patrick: Can you walk us through one technical infrastructure example of literally what you built in a specific country so that I can get a sense starting with that API, or you pick the starting point? If I'm trying to flow up through your technology infrastructure into a recurring payment to Spotify, I would love to understand in as much detail as you can provide, the literal steps or the infrastructure that you built to enable that thing. Sebastian: Let's use a Google example in Brazil. Google wants to collect from their users for ads, cloud, YouTube, and play. And they want to be able to accept local credit cards. So locally acquired credit cards. They want to be able to offer installments. They want to offer a thing called the PIX, which is a Central Bank sponsored payment method, and they want to offer Bullet. Bullet is a cash method where you go and you pay in the counter with cash. What we do is we give Google one single access point, one single API, and we'll tell them, you integrate into this API and you're going to have access too. Your user wants to pay with installments, we are going to route that transaction dynamically to the acquirer and we're going to have the ability of preventing fraud because we understand the dynamics behind that. We also are going to be able to navigate that information and send it to the tax authority, to understand exactly how much tax that given transaction needs to be paid.Once that transaction settles, so once a user is actually paid, we're going to collect those funds. You're going to get a notification, which is standardized through the API, where we are telling you user A, bought their YouTube subscription, they paid a 100 BRL, this is how much tax is going to be paid. This is how many dollars you're going to be receiving should you decide to get dollars. This is our fraud screening of that transaction. The same will happen for every single payment method. So for that credit card transaction, you'll see exactly the same messaging as for the fixed one, as for bullet, installments. And all of that complexity, all of those use cases are captured under this same API.Two more complexities that we capture under our technology. Number one is if Google instead of wanting to collect from a user will be dispersing to a YouTube creator, the same logic applies. So instead of them calling a collection, they call it a what we call payout. And essentially they're sending the funds through the banking system in this example in Brazil. The other complexity that we will also capture under our API is that if that user, instead of sitting in Brazil, it's sitting in Egypt or in Mexico or in Chile, exactly the same technology will apply. So there's no additional integration work whatsoever from a Google centric. All they need to do is change the configuration. Instead of putting BR, they'll say MX for Mexico, and the whole logic will apply to the local market where they operate. All of that complexity we try to offer. Patrick: How does it feel from the user perspective, in the case of a disbursement back from the company? Google's got a hoard of engineers that know how to use APIs, a consumer just has the way they like to get stuff. Where does it sit? How do you interact with the consumer? Or are you just interacting with the business entity or the government entity that makes that payment method available in Brazil, for example? Sebastian: Great point. We don't interact with the end user. And this year example of this is we pay out many of the Uber and DiDi drivers across the emerging markets. Every Wednesday they'll get the payment. What will happen behind the scenes is that Uber funded us, so they settle funds into us and they called an API saying, these funds need to go to driver number one, these funds go to driver number two. And the driver will see into the bank account X amount of pesos or dollars or naira in their bank account under the Uber name. So they'll never know that dLocal was the one paying. Patrick: In the example of Brazil, you've got this really clean interface from Google's perspective, there're all sorts of complexity and each one of those things is interesting to me. So FX, for example, how are you handling that? Are you effectively doing the trading function to all this? Talk me through like the FX, as an example, if you're dealing with X number of different currencies in a field standard to Google. Sebastian: Yes, absolutely. There's a trading function. So there's two sides to it. One is the ability to exfiltrate the funds in markets that have capital controls. So Brazil, it's an open market, but there are restrictions in terms of what you can do depending on the amounts you settle. So for every single transaction we want to exfiltrate from Brazil, we need to report that to the central bank. All of that reporting, it's on automatic. So once we get that okay, which is done automatically, then we have our own treasury function. Essentially they bundle the millions of small transactions that we've got. They exchange that into dollars or euros, and they exfiltrate those funds and sell directly to the global companies wherever they are. The same process happens multiple times a day in every market where we operate. Any given day, we're going to be trading 30 plus currencies multiple times a day to make sure that our merchants are getting their preferred currency in wherever they decide to live. Patrick: When you're attacking a country, building your business, is it right to think about it like you would have a team that's just dedicated to Brazil because it's so idiosyncratic? So there's a Brazil product team and that team ultimately has to roll up to the standard that would then pass over to clients via the API, but everything leading up to that standard is idiosyncratic to the country, or do you apply the same team across different countries? Sebastian: We have an expansion team whose sole responsibility is whenever we launch a new market, setting up our own entities, hiring our country manager, that it's always our first hire. Understanding the regulatory framework, understanding what are the payment methods that need to be offered. And once they have that package, we consolidate that into our product. We don't localize our product. We do have people in product sitting everywhere, but the product team, we do a very adamant effort to make sure that it's one team. We don't want dLocal in India to look and feel differently from dLocal in South Africa or different from dLocal in Mexico. That's why we insist so much in this idea of one API.One of the challenges payments companies sometimes have is they start to aggregate platforms one on top of the other. So if you're a global company, you want to operate with them, they tell you, look, if it's Latin America you have one API. If it's Africa, you have a different one. If it's Southeast Asia, you have a different one. We are obsessed with the idea of making sure that wherever we are doing business, our merchants can navigate. So expansion teams need to make sure that we understand what's going on on the ground. That they set up an entity, they set up the initial operation, and then the operation team kicks in and they are the ones running the business on a day to day basis. You'll see people from dLocal sitting in India taking care of the India operation. But everything from a product, a technology perspective, it's done from a consolidated standpoint because we want to keep that holistic view. Patrick: If I forced you to retire tomorrow as the CEO and turn into a payments only early stage investor, what would be the things that you'd be looking for in other payment companies that would get you excited about their perspective success? Sebastian: This is a new one. I'm not trying to retire, I'm 31, so let's start there. Having said that if you don't control your technology, you don't have a chance. So I would be looking at strong technical teams that understand innovation in payments happens right in the middle between the financial world and the technology world. I think that's a lesson that some of the companies we named before and hopefully we as well understand really well. If you're just good at technology, but you don't get to understand the real problems, regulatory frameworks, and the reality on the ground, you're going to be a nice technology that no one is going to be adopting. If you just understand regulatory frameworks and you understand the financial system, but you're really bad at technology, you're a bank. Great, but not what gets me excited.If I were to back a company, I want a company that understands really well, the framework on which they're operating from a traditional perspective, from a regulatory financial perspective. And hopefully they have a technology innovation that helps navigate that. Not technology per se, but something that is really solving a pain point in that sense. Companies that find that balance are the ones that make magic happen for users. If you look at the innovations that you've seen in payments, it's typically an easier way of getting on board or an easier way to getting a merchant account. Is that crazy to do? Absolutely no, but you are required to understand what can be done from a regulatory standpoint. And they have a great technology that allows you to power them. That's a sweet spot. That's where we want to be and that's what would get me excited. Patrick: What have you learned given how many times you've done it about working with new regulators and regulatory environments? What is excellent to you on your team at dealing with this unique aspect of it, if that's such a key part of success? Sebastian: To me, the biggest lesson has been the importance of treating regulators as grownups that are trying to do the best they can in the markets under the conditions they operate. Sometimes us from a payment standpoint or from a technology standpoint, we want to move fast. We want everything to be obvious in 30 seconds. We forget that people in the regulatory bodies have a very different set of incentives. They want to understand exactly what is it that's going to be processed, and making sure that you raise their comfort level and you continue to invest in that education process, it's something that we've learned.In many countries where we operate, we are working with the regulator to build a regulatory framework. This is how a regulatory framework should look for a company like Google. These are the things you should take care of. This is how you should think of taxes. And I think over time, they get to see us more and more as an enabler. The thing that has happened in the last few years is that some of the merchants for which we process have become ubiquitous in the markets where we operate. Users won't live without Facebook or without Google, or they'll do WhatsApp messaging and commerce, and they'll drive an Uber and they'll get a Rappi . All of that complexity exists and regulators understand. So they are more and more open to say, how do we cover for this? How do we make sure there's a regulatory framework? There's a way for these companies to be able to thrive and us as a regulator to be comfortable. Understanding those two things has been extremely important.",2464
207,Sebastian Kanovich - Powering Emerging Markets Payments,Globalization Trends and the Business of Payments," Patrick: The trend of globalization, or in some cases deglobalization like, if you think about physical supply chain, I think one of the most interesting things happening today, it seems like there is trends physically in deglobalization, more localized supply chains, more concerns over perfectly integrated global system. But it seems like you are enabling more digital globalization, meaning you're serving the Netflixs or the Spotifys or the Googles of the world that effectively are great companies that have customers literally everywhere and customers want them and they want the customers. What would you say about that concept of your role or payments' role in what I'll call digital globalization in the trends that we may see in the next decade in that area? Sebastian: I'm always worried on overplaying our role. We are a payments company and we build infrastructure and the great things that are happening in this space are entirely because there's great companies thinking of these markets. The role we have to play it's making sure that those opportunities can happen. We are not a merchant ourselves. We are not here to sell goods to users or to pay out the creator. We do want to make sure that transactions can happen. What I've seen, and I know there's this whole concept of deglobalization, but we are still seeing that merchants recognize that their futures are outside of their home countries. We started serving U.S. companies and at some four years back, I had the chance to go to China. And we said, ""Okay, for every Google, there's going to be a counterpart in China for every Facebook, there's a going to be a TikTok for every Uber there's going to be a DiDi.""Our bet was that both of them would be relevant, but most importantly, that they would be relevant in the markets where we operate. If you look today at where the growth is coming from for a company like DiDi, it's coming from Latin America. Today it's obvious, but four years back was crazy. If you look at Shein or Shopee, which are retailers, they're killing it all across emerging markets and they've grown like crazy. We do expect U.S companies to struggle a little bit more in China. We do expect Chinese companies to struggle in the U.S., but we do see them booming in emerging markets. That's their playing field, if you will and that's where we are expecting all of their growth to company. Patrick: One of the things I'm obsessed with, with technology is the ways it lowers friction and when you lower friction, the explosion of activity that happens on the back of that. What are examples that you've seen of that so far with dLocal? What new activity or new behavior is most interesting, whether it's from the merchant side or the customer side, as a result of you creating lower payments friction? Sebastian: On the payout side, we've launched our payouts products, so the ability of a merchant to sell funds to a user. When Uber was expanding into Latin America, and essentially we went with them, they said, ""We have this need to pay out thousands of drivers, banking system doesn't work."" They were sending wires before that cost lots of money, and they take forever to hit the account. So they told us we need the funds to hit the account every Wednesday in local currency and you cannot miss. The first week we did manually. I still remember to this day, we paid 700 Uber drivers in Argentina manually. So that's a very clear or extreme case if you will of an infrastructure powering an opportunity.We've launched our issuing product, giving merchants the ability to issue cards to their users. And we are seeing crazy adoption in places where we wouldn't have thought of before. We are seeing a lot of traction on the remote workspace, where more and more people in emerging markets are working for global companies. And one of the things those global companies are trying to do is give their users a financial product, which essentially it's a credit card with their salaries and hopefully some benefits. When we launch issuing that wasn't the use case we're expecting. That gig economy or remote workers economy has definitely surprised us. We learned that whenever the infrastructure is there, new opportunities come up. Canva, Australian company being extremely successful in India. I would love to tell you, Patrick, that we saw that one coming, but that wasn't part of the plan when we launched. We say, ""Okay, there needs to be an infrastructure into India someone is going to use."" I couldn't have betted it would be an Australian company. Patrick: Can you walk me through the business of a payment, like a single payment and understanding how the economics of this work and how much they vary country to country? I'm sending a $100 from Uber to driver one, what are the cost centers in the intention of Uber, having the dollars in their U.S. bank account to getting it to the bank account of the driver, wherever it goes? What are the steps and the cost of those steps that are relevant? Sebastian: This is one of the things I like about payments. The unit economics are super simple. For every transaction, there's a cost processing that payment, which essentially it's the funds that can get paid through the payment method for doing that service they're offering. If it's a bank transfer, what do we need to pay the bank? If it's a credit card transaction, what we need to pay the acquirers, the issuers, the networks for that payment? So that's what we call cost in our gross profit line. What are sources of revenue? Two sources. One, it's a fee that we charge the merchant. They'll pay for every transaction a percentage fee or a fixed amount, depending on the business case, very similar to what a credit card transaction does.And then there's a second source of revenue, which only applies to cross border transactions, which is the FX spreads. For every FX transaction, we call it FX fee, for us, both of them are interchangeable. For every transaction if we're going to be collecting BRL or nairas, we are going to apply a spread on that transaction. So if you want to take $1, there's a fee for processing, there's a fee for FX. Those two are our two sources of revenue. There's a cost of processing that transaction, which we call processing costs. And that gets you to our gross profit which is a clean margin that each transaction provides.At dLocal, we've always taken a stance that every dollar needs to be processed at a profit, so every single dollar in our platform contributes to that margin. And the reason we've done that is we believe that it's really powerful when your incentives are aligned to your customers. Every morning, I receive a report on who did what volumes yesterday. And every time I see a customer doing well, I'm happy because I know that number one, means more growth for them, but necessarily independently of where it is, no matter what's the payment method, it's not matter what the geography, no matter what product that has contributed to our margin. Patrick: Is that controversial, that opinion? Would other investors or operators say that you should operate at a loss in certain segments as a means to accessing higher margin segments? Sebastian: Traditionally the banking system or banking products, in many cases, they thought of payments as a loss leader, where we give this for free and we make money on credit, or we make money in other places. I think for payments company it's well understood. There are sometimes challenges in terms of, if you are expanding into all these markets, why don't you subsidize the early adoption? And that's something we are strongly against. We want to make sure every business of ours stands on their own legs. But most importantly, we don't want to wake up one morning and saying, ""Oh, our merchants is great. We are so set."" We want to avoid that, no matter what. Patrick: From the listener's standpoint, that's never thought about payments, you mentioned the cost center is the processing and that's different at different places. In the digital world I might think why isn't that zero? Why is there a cost there? Like you're just moving bits around. So what is the source of cost to process a payment or a transaction? Sebastian: I do agree with you that over time the cost should go down. As fundamentally, there's no reason why there should be a high cost of moving funds around. As you said, these are bits moving from one place to the other. But you also need to think that you need to give an incentive to the network to operate. If you use a more extreme case of a cash method in Mexico, it's called Oxxo, or in Egypt it's called Fawry, they're operating branches. They need to give an incentive for the cash store to be able to collect and disperse. If you move to that extreme case to a bank account, a bank to bank transaction, that cost should be lower. And when you look at the most innovative stuff like what's happening with UPI in India or Pix in Brazil, they're following very much to the reason that you are saying. This shouldn't have a cost. This cost is a tax on the society overall, and we should bring it down. And we're seeing that. Our cost of processing payments continues to go down because the nature of the business requires it to be that way. Patrick: If you think about currencies as a key variable in the dLocal business equation, obviously you're dealing with lots of different currencies. What variables have you come to be interested in or appreciate when you're approaching a new currency? What matters in a currency? What do you think about? Sebastian: We are not currency traders, so we are not taking positions in foreign currency. We don't want to guess or bet what currency is going to go up and what's going to go down. That's not our business by any means. We are purely transactional business where we want to make sure that transactions are flowing. And therefore the key factor for us is liquidity. It's the ability of exchanging that given currency to dollars or euros and back. That's where we focus, making sure that if we collected pesos, we can get dollars. And if we have dollars we can get nairas or reais or whatever it is that we are trading.We don't take positions. We don't try to guess what's going to happen next week. Every day, we collect funds in local currency and we exfiltrate. Every day we collect dollars and we refiltrate and that's done automatically, and that's also a place where investors have been challenging us for years now. We don't know what's going to happen. That's not our business. Our business is transactional. And we want to make sure that we are in that business and not on the trading, if you will. Patrick: So there's no currency inventory, right? You're clearing your books every day. Sebastian: Yeah. Ideally we would hold local currency for a second. That's what we ask our treasury function. The reality of the ground requires sometimes for us to have longer positions, but there's never going to be a situation where our traders are going to say, ""No, we are going to hold our position in reais because we think on Monday, we're going to have a better break."" No way on earth.",2526
208,Sebastian Kanovich - Powering Emerging Markets Payments,Distribution as an API Business," Patrick: Can we talk about the distribution of your product and its adoption and how you've affected that? Because with most API companies you're facing developers and building community, building great documentation, oftentimes it's a bottom up adoption versus selling into a chief information officer or something. Tell me what you've learned there. How do you go to market? How do you reach your customers? What is your sales and marketing method? Sebastian: We are slightly different in the sense that we are serving big enterprises. I would love to tell you that a developer inside Apple will make the decision to integrate into us and launch our solution across 30 emerging markets. It won't happen. That's not how our resale process works. Fundamentally, we deal with people on the finance teams and on the payment teams that are extremely savvy and understand this challenge very, very well, and they are looking for a partner to help them navigate this complexity. We are not in a situation where we need to go and explain the complexity. Our merchants do understand it really well. They see the pain point and they're trying to navigate.So we have a very small sales and marketing team. For overall commercial team, it's less than 80 people as of today, including account management and customer success. So it's a very specialized team, very high touch. And it's a team that really understands the complexity behind the payments where we operate. So our counterparts are experts and they're counting on us to be extreme experts on the markets where we operate. And that's a reason behind not having hundreds or thousands of salespeople. At the end of the day, when you are doing a deal with Spotify, there's two people sitting on the table. You won't be able to seat 50 people. We invest more on making sure that those two people will have the information, the context, be empowered to understand our product. Then we invest a lot on understanding our merchant needs.We've seen many industries, so we know how Spotify should think because we've seen it happening with Netflix, with HBO. We know how DiDi will think because we've seen it with Uber, with Grabify, with Adriver, with Rapid. The same thing happens for retailers. So having the experience of understanding what's drives the needs for each vertical and really understanding the reality on the ground, it's really important. The only caveat to this is marketplace, where we are powering thousands of smaller merchants that come to our marketplace. That idea goes to your point of making sure that our product is easy to use, that we are top of mind for the next small Shopify seller that wants to sell into cheap. And that's a whole different set of needs and expectations from our merchants. Patrick: Is that a relatively small part of your business overall? I would think you're dominated by the huge international players. Sebastian: Most of our business still comes from big enterprises. I think it's going to continue to be the case. Having said that we do invest a lot of marketplaces and we think of the marketplace as our customer. When you think of a marketplace, they are trying to give tools for all of their sellers or all of their ecosystem. I think we have very strong offering in that ecosystem. But in our DNA, it's going to be more normal to go directly to the marketplace owner, to the Wix, to the Shopify and say, these are the tools we can provide for your sellers. Then going directly to the servers. Patrick: There's a nice thesis that I like to think about, which is that for every repetitive digital function, there will be an API first company that standardizes that function and provides a sort of Lego piece so that developers can build as many apps as they want. And they basically hire out the discreet repeatable functions. Since you're doing that, providing one of those very big function in this case, abstracted away from payments, what have you learned just about great API building? What advice would you give to the founders out there not in payments, but just in the API space that are trying to build an excellent single function that becomes widely adopted for developers? Sebastian: I think the biggest temptation when you are building an API business is what your API should do and what it shouldn't do and what are the limits of what you are trying to build. APIs are powerful where they're standardized. So if for any given use case, you need to integrate into five different places, even if the value proposition is great, to me, that's dead before starting. We always try to find an initial pain point that can be covered and be ruthless about saying no to the other stuff, because we think that's a way that you generally differentiate. It's tough to be solving hundreds of things because you are aiming to standardize. By definition if you standardizes, you need to say no to some stuff. If you have too many use cases, you are not covering anything. That's something we've learned and we've learned the hard way.The other thing is API businesses are sometimes tempted to compete with their customers. When you're providing infrastructure, you are sitting in the middle of that transaction where value is being created, and it's very tempting for companies to say, ""I understand the user. I understand the merchants. Why do I sit in the middle?"" Part of what I think has made dLocal successful as of now, it's making sure that our merchants and our counterparts understand that we are not here to compete with them. We are here to power them and for infrastructure place like us and typically API based companies are infrastructure place, I see many of them being tempted to be in front of the end user, and that's something I would strongly discourage. Patrick: Maybe we could give an example of each of those two things. Those are awesome lessons. So starting with the first one, in dLocal, what was an example of the feature that was tempting to build or that you did build that turned out to too much of a distraction for whatever reason? Sebastian: We've been asked 100 times to go to Germany or to the U.K. Is it easy to do from an API standpoint? Very easy. Do we have the regulatory framework? Absolutely. Are we going to do it? No way. Part of that is saying, what are the use cases that are really complex that we're going to be able to solve? I'm sure that we could get some traction in that business. Is it going to be a differentiator? No, it's not. So we'd rather double down or invest in places where it might take longer, but if we get it right, we are differentiating. That's why we get much more excited over Bangladesh than we get about Germany, because there's other APIs that are solving the German problem really well or the U.K. or the U.S. problem really well. That's one lesson.On the second side on not going after your users, when we were starting, we got many of our merchants to ask us to send emails to our database saying, promote our product. Today it's very easy to say no. Back in 2016, when we were starting, we said it might be tempting. And we understood really fast that was not a smart decision. Many payments companies do that. We were always against it, because the moment you do it once, you start, the next situation is to this is the product you should be buying. This is how you should be thinking about which ride sharing company to use. And we want to be able to provide infrastructure. We shouldn't be choosing winners. It's very tempting and it's something we haven't done. And we are strongly committed not to do.",1669
209,Sebastian Kanovich - Powering Emerging Markets Payments,Moving Fast and Breaking Things," Patrick: How would you describe how you've been able to move so fast? You mentioned starting mid 2010s, 2015, 2016. Here we are in 2022, and it's a very large $10 billion public company. That's a fast building of enterprise value. Why were you able to do that so fast? What's behind the speed? Sebastian: First of all, it doesn't feel fast from the inside. Things take forever from the inside. We're always pushing for them to be faster. And when you do enterprise sales the way we do cycles are long. When we started dLocal, I was 25 and I was anxious and I'm still anxious, and I would like things to happen 10 times faster. I think the key behind the success and I wouldn't call it fast because I see it as things taking time, is the fact that we always focus about doing the things that matter. We weren't out there doing stuff that was ancillary. We bootstrapped dLocal for the first four years of our history. So we didn't spend much time thinking about funding runs and PR announcements. We are a company that has been dedicated to operating its business, so you won't see us running our own funds or our own investments. We are running dLocal, and this is what we are committed to.We've stayed extremely focused in this idea for emerging markets. Those three key things have been extremely important. And we built it from a very different background than the average Silicon Valley company. That has become really deeply ingrained in our DNA. We always cared about being profitable. We cared about serving our merchants. You mentioned the market up, to me that's a consequence and it will continue to be a consequence. It will go up, it will go down over time. Both will happen in that's perfectly okay. What we should make sure is that we are building a business that's healthy, that manages to generate profits, that it's adding value to its merchants, that adds value to the ecosystem where it participates. And those are the pillars we really care about much more than any PR or other stuff that I think are sometimes very destructive. Patrick: What are the ways that you think dLocal could most prove as a business or a service? Sebastian: The secret for dLocal it's for it to be able to be extremely local, but at the same time standardized. That formula and how fast to do that, it's extremely important and I think that's a place where we are never going to be good enough. Whenever we launch a new market, understanding the reality on the ground, understanding what are their frictions, but also being able to standardize that, that's a place where I would like us to be 10 times better. I happen to believe that dLocal doesn't have a market risk in the sense that we have all the underlying trends that go in our favor. There's all these separate trends, eCommerce becoming more relevant, emerging markets becoming more relevant. So for us, it's all our execution. It sounds super basic and boring, but that's where I want us to be better in our commercial efforts. I want us to make sure that our customer success team gives our merchants the best experience on earth. We need to understand markets faster. It's a pure execution play. Patrick: With execution in mind, how do you run the company? What is the operating system that you've installed inside the company? There're famous ones like OKRs or V2MOM at Salesforce. There's lots of these different styles or methods, have you adopted one of those or built one of those? Sebastian: No, we are trying to make it as we go. We follow an approach of extreme responsibility, but also a lot of humility. Our background has to define us in that sense. We weren't supposed to be here, keeping that humility and keeping that ability of learning, it's extremely important for any leader that comes into the organization. We give our leaders extreme freedom for two reasons. One, it's because it's the right thing to do. But two, because we don't know and we need them to make us better. So we expect a lot of our team. We are very clear about the fact that we are a professional team player. I love that concept from Netflix in the sense that we all need to be better all the time in order for the organization to be better. And part of that, it's giving people freedom, go do what you need to do in order to make us better.And the other thing is that we've always been very basic in terms of the KPIs we follow. So we don't have 1,000 KPIs. We want to know how much volumes we are doing. We want to know what's our revenue, what's our gross profit, how much we are spending and therefore what's our EVTA. And those metrics apply to the whole company. Our salespeople are looking the same numbers that I am looking. And I think when you have those incentives align and you give clear guidance in what's important and what's not, life becomes much, much easier. That's how we operate. But we are refining it obviously all the time. Patrick: Usually this idea of constant improvement of the team bleeding into the starts at the top. So in what ways have you personally most improved or gotten better do you think over the last several years? Sebastian: I don't know if I've gotten better, but I do know that I've challenged myself systematically. I try to make sure that every now and then, I'm in a situation where I'm uncomfortable, where I need to learn. We went through the IPO process and obviously that was a heck of a challenge. We were ready to be a public company, being the CEO of a public company, that's definitely something I wasn't ready for four years back, or even one year back. Putting yourself in those positions and making sure you're never the one holding the company back and being very transparent about it, it's extremely important. In my case, it has also meant understanding whether there are functions that are better if they're run by someone else.So our technology team is being run by Jacob who's our president. He runs it and I trust Jacob with everything. Part of that was understanding that he was much better than I am at doing that. When you have that low ego environment where people understand that things need to be done and we are sometimes going to be playing different roles in that given day, that's super helpful. I always tell the team, and I think it myself, I'm not dLocal's [inaudible] who happens to be dLocal's CO at this point, and therefore I need to be doing the best I can. But if tomorrow, someone else it's better to be CO of dLocal, we should all encourage it. And that happens at every single position in the company. And I think the moment we stop being in love with our titles and we are in love with what we are trying to do, that's very powerful. Patrick: What's the reason behind this mentality that you seem to have of deep humility? Where does this come from? Sebastian: I don't know. That's the first answer. If I have to guess, I think it comes from two places. The reason why I like what I do is because I continue to learn. If you're not humble to recognize that you're learning, it wouldn't make sense for me. I'm trying to find ways to learn more and the best way of doing so it's recognizes that you don't know that much and you're trying to find ways of being better. And then I think there's something of a personal background of where we come from and Uruguay being a small country and being used to trying to be this way. Patrick: What do you think the biggest mistake that you've made as a business is in dLocal's history and what did you learn from that mistake? Sebastian: We were shy. We were shy when we were starting. We should have invested much heavier in 2016, in 2017. Being bootstrapped, it was tough for us. We wanted to be a U.S. company. We said, ""How do we make sure we are perceived as a Silicon Valley company?"" And that was a mistake. We are who we are. We come from our own backgrounds and we can differentiate and build amazing companies from very different places. That's an obvious lesson. And in terms of investment, which is the flip side of that, one of the things that I see in Israel, where I live or in the valley where I spend a lot of time, is that companies are there to bring big. In Israel you see that all the time, and that's something dLocal had to learn. We started small. We didn't know we could be this big. It took us some years at the beginning to say, ""Okay, we can really make an impact. We can create a huge company no matter where we started from."" And that has been a less for us. Patrick: This has been so much fun. As I said at the beginning, I'm fascinated by the entire payment space, your company and others reduce this friction in such an interesting way that enable more commerce online and throughout the world in such an interesting way. And I love the style with which you've built the business it's distinct and interesting. I appreciate your time. I ask everybody that I talk to the same traditional closing question. What is the kindest thing that anyone's ever done for you? Sebastian: This is something we say a lot at dLocal, we have all the background. We are not here just because of our efforts. We are here because we have a background that allowed us to get here. Being born in the family, I had luck to, that's a very lucky and a very kind thing. We cannot give it for granted, particularly when you see others that don't have that. And that's what you realize, how much of a difference it's made. Patrick: Randomly, we are recording this on the same day we released an episode with my friend, John Pfeffer, who also lives in Uruguay. So it's funny that my two Uruguay related episodes have a day in common. For those that would like to learn more about Uruguay or come visit, how would you recommend we approach the country, which sounds wonderful? Sebastian: First of all, come over. The biggest challenge Uruguay has is that it's far away. Other than that, everything it's nice. It's easy. It's a beautiful place to visit. People are welcoming and it's absolutely beautiful. I've had the chance to be in a few places in the world, and this continues to be unique. Patrick: Fantastic. Sebastian, thank you so much for your time. Sebastian: Patrick, appreciate it. Thanks very much for having me.This site uses cookies to improve your browsing experience. By using this site, you are consenting to this policy.",2454
210,"Frank Slootman - Narrow the Focus, Increase the Quality",Introduction," Patrick: My guest today is Frank Slootman, Chairman and CEO of cloud platform Snowflake. Frank has become one of the most revered CEOs in business. Over the past 20 years, he has three times taken over emerging enterprise software businesses. First, Data Domain, then Service Now, and most recently, Snowflake. And led them across the chasm into large billion dollar businesses. Please enjoy this great discussion with Frank Slootman.",100
211,"Frank Slootman - Narrow the Focus, Increase the Quality",Evaluating and Building a Team," Patrick: So Frank, I think I first came across your thinking in your work reading Tape Sucks very early in my career and loved some of the lessons from there. And then when Amp It Up came out, the origin LinkedIn post and now book, it became kind of one of my Bibles that I hand out. And so I figured now that you've done a few interviews, I'd try to do something a little bit different to compliment the ones that you've done and sort of go through the life cycle, since you've done this at least three times with Service Now, Data Domain, and now Snowflake, go through the episode of you coming into a company and applying some of these principles that you've written about. And I'd love to start with people. So when you are orienting yourself day one in a new company, how do you go about or suggest others go about evaluating the team that you have so that you can begin to get the right team in place? Frank: The obvious answer to that question is you're not so much inspecting the people, you're inspecting the work. That may sound like an obvious distinction, but if I don't know that people, obviously I can't tell, but I can certainly look at what they're responsible for is functioning or not. And on the basis of that, I'm going to make decisions really, really quickly. I'm not going to go wait this out. I mean, somebody's running HR and HR is not functioning worth a dam. That's enough. On the other hand, the opposite is also true if something is working really, really well. That would be a reason to really embrace the people that are there.Again, I'm stating the obvious here, but that is how it is. Certainly, when I was a younger man, I used to wait things out, even in spite of the evidence, because it seemed like a reasonable thing to do, but it was stupid. I just avoided what I already knew. I avoided the inevitable, lost a lot of time. And by the way, your whole leadership mojo is being tested because when you're parachuting into a quagmire, and sometimes even a crisis situation, you need to move. Okay. This is not like, oh, let's take six months here to see what's going on. You operate with imperfect information. That's always the case. You be comfortable with that. It's possible you're wrong about things. And then you just need to be a fast course corrector. But I will tell you, I've never been wrong removing people from their jobs and I've never been too early removing people from their jobs either. I have been too late however. Patrick: I love taking some of your principles to their natural extension or conclusion. And in this case, you might say you make that decision literally on day one. That would sound crazy extreme, but how extreme are we talking? Is this a matter of weeks that you think these decisions can be made? Like what is the upper limit of this pace to decide who no longer belongs in the situation? Frank: In the case of the most recent company, which is Snowflake, I was talking to the board for a relatively short period of time, but I already said, you need to buy into this. Here's what's going to happen. In other words, the decisions were made prior to day one even. Because I wasn't going to go one of those scenarios where now I got to go make my case to the board while I'm making all these changes. No, I did that real early before I stepped through the door. So things were rocking and rolling from the beginning, which is unsettling to the organization. I get it, but it's always unsettling. You're better off ripping the band-aid off and moving and create clarity sooner rather than letting things percolate and people just staring at each other, like what's the next shoe and the next shoe to drop. You don't want that. You want to get through it as fast as you can what we wanted to do and what we were going to do and we're moving on. It doesn't mean that there's not change that's coming later on. You can talk to the people at Snowflake. There have not been any changes after those first 90 days or so. So in other words, I'm almost in three years now. Everything happens in the first 90 days. Patrick: If you are, rather than letting people go, bringing new senior executives onto the team, how do you solve that same problem of understanding their potential quality as leaders, as doers, especially if you haven't worked with them before? Frank: It's also an obvious question. It should be obvious to the audience. You don't learn that much from an interview. I think interviews are highly overrated because it's like two dogs sniffing each other, deciding whether they can even get through the door or not. And there's nothing wrong with that, but you're going to base the hiring decision on that. You're insane. How you find out is that you talk to everybody that you can possibly talk to, who has lived with that person, a superior, subordinate or a peer. Just ask the question. What was that person like? What was great? What was not so great? Very, very quickly, you're going to get a very good picture, both in the performance end, but also the behavioral end. In other words, you can probe from almost any dimension if you want and you get a consistent view, which gives you high confidence that you're dealing with a good situation.Now I thought situations where we were making higher risk moves, where we weren't sure whether this person was right or not, we just talk to each other and we go like, look, this may not work out. Okay. Sometimes we do make decisions like that, where we're nervous and we will still pull the trigger and do it. Doesn't happen very often. Sometimes we do it. Our eyes are wide open and unfortunately a lot of those don't work out because our intuition, our understanding upfront was already tipping us off that it wasn't the right move. But sometimes we push ourselves down that path because we have a need. Sometimes it's more of a hope strategy than anything else. I find that, and this happens in the ranks as well. People don't spend nearly enough time doing background checks and it's easy to do. You get on LinkedIn. You can find the contemporaries of this person, the ones that work in your company. Okay. In other words, you don't have to go outside the company even to find out what's going on because we're all hired from the same orbit. If I need to find somebody who worked at VMware in a certain period of time, I probably got hundreds of people who never worked at VMware at that period of time. This is not hard.",1485
212,"Frank Slootman - Narrow the Focus, Increase the Quality",The Value of Confrontation," Patrick: Leadership requires constant confrontation. What have you learned about a great episode or a very productive episode of confrontation? Like with characterizes a great confrontation? Frank: Confrontation is just our normal MO. I never think of them as being great. The thing is we're malcontent. I think I've used that word in the book as well. We consider ourselves sort of always unhappy with the status quo and there's always room up. There's always this gap that exists. If there's always a gap, in regards to everything, then there's always confrontation. You're confronting the variance all the time. It's sort of a normal mode. It's the mode you're always in. It's not like, oh, now we're going to go confront some stuff. That's all day long. It's really the main mode we are. We're not trying to pat people in the back all day. Oh my God, you're doing such a great job. I'm so proud of what's going on here. That's not how we talk. We talk about specific things that this is not working well. Why are these guys not come up? It's a very, very inquisitive probing, trying to understand what's going on, raising the bar. In other words, always have higher expectations.The thing you're fighting in an organization is that people want to let things pass. When the sales managers says to me, ""I'd rather have somebody than nobody,"" Then it's like, ""Okay, you're the wrong person."" Because I'd rather have nobody than somebody who is not functioning because those become real leadership traps because everybody sees that person is not functioning. You're not doing anything about it. That's how you lose your leadership mojo. You can't tolerate it. You're better off, went on, and then taking you your time finding the replacement. And recruiting is a whole other topic, by the way. We can talk about that. But rather than suffering and tolerating mediocrity is the absolute worst reflection you can have. Patrick: So a lot of that is about making sure that someone is correct in the recruiting process, but the very best people often need to be sold. So you need to sell them on joining you. What have you found to be the most effective, whether it's compensation, mission, responsibility, some cocktail of those things. What has been your playbook for convincing a senior talented person to join you? Frank: It depends a great deal and will say culture sorts people because culture is not for everybody. And it's for certain people and it's not for others. So if your culture is very distinct, are you the right kind of person for this culture. Most people, by the way, really want to understand what is it like to work here? Is this the place where I'm going to be like a fish in the water where I can really flourish as an individual, become the best version of myself or I'm going to be swimming in glue all day and just be frustrated with toxic culture and poisonous work environments. I'm involved in a lot of recruiting, by the way. I mean, I'm doing as much recruiting. Our engineering leadership, they're pulling in very, very high end talent in the world and you know, yeah, they want to talk to me. They want to talk to my CFO. I mean, this is almost a normal process. So they want to understand how committed am I to division and the mission, the business.What is the culture really, really? Not your stated culture, but your actual culture. They're very wide ranging. They're very honest, very transparent. We're not going to tell you the story and then you come in here and you find out something else. We're super transparent because we want to know that this is really what they're coming for and then it's going to be a really great fit. But yeah, recruiting is another version of sales obviously. I also agree with there's another version of M & A. Because they're all in the same spectrum because when you do M & A, I mean, essentially what you're buying is talent. The way you can buy it through a company, I mean, you can also buy it through hiring people. Sits on the same spectrum. Patrick: How do you generate energy personally for this pace of business? It strikes me that even the most talented people get tired. Everyone gets tired at some point. How do you fight that, modulate that, control the energy source yourself as the leader of a business like this? Frank: I personally experienced that when I stepped down at Service Now in 2017. I was tired. I'd been on the firing line too long. I didn't understand it at the time. Took me literally years to understand why I felt the way that I did, but I was burned out. There's another word for being tired. I couldn't get up for it anymore. I couldn't muster, just like you said, I couldn't muster the energy and the intensity anymore and you need to get out, which is what I did, because I felt I was no longer the right person for the company, even though things were just going insanely well, and they've continued now five years later to still go really well because the foundations we build are exceptional. I still feel that way. And I don't always say that about stuff. So now it's actually easier for me because I don't work with the same pressures. The pressures, for me, they change over time. When I had my first company, I was just, I had this cannot fail cloud hanging over my head in the worst way. It was like a do or die situation. So the level of intensity was off the charts. It was a great environment because it wasn't just me. There were all kinds of people that were sort of feeling exactly the same way. This is going to be our opportunity. Burners behind us. We have no way through, other than winning in the marketplace. I think Henry Kissinger once said, ""Nothing clears the mind like a lack of options."" It's that kind of a dynamic, where there are no choice. You're going to do it or else.ServiceNow was a very different deal for me because data domain was a startup. There were 15 people there. No revenue, no customer, no nothing. It was very hard to figure out what is this? But it became a terrific company. It was enough different. I mean, they've already grown 100% in a year and they've come up a year doing 75 million in revenue. So, that was a company that clearly crossed the chasm. That then also put enormous pressure on me because it's now, these challenges are totally different from the ones that I previously. Such an underperforming organization at so many levels, even though the numbers were quite good. Another favorite topic, you can have really good numbers and still be a highly underperforming company, boards are sometimes shallow in their assessments. They get the numbers and they go check, everything's going great. Well, that's not how it is. You really have to get behind the numbers and all of that. When I came to Snowflake, I got there with a different dynamic and a different personal motivation than I had in the previous companies. I didn't feel the personal pressure as much, but I felt other kinds of pressure. So, they change over time, I would say, depending on your own situation and what's in your history, what's in your past. Patrick: Last question on people, and then I'd love to move to product. How do you foster the right kind of communication pathways. I think it's Conway's law that you ship your org chart. Your product ends up looking like the communication pathways and the health of your communication inside of a business. So, what have you learned about good, healthy, especially in the leadership team, communication throughout a business? Frank: What's really important to us is that we're a highly lateral organization, meaning that the org chart, which is very vertical, is really not that important to us. I treat a lot of people that officially, on the org chart, report to me, and people that are actually a level below that on the org chart, I treat them exactly the same way and I have weekly check ins with them. I talk to them just as much. I have just as intense an interaction with them. That fluidity of an organization, the lateral nature and the network nature of it is really important because we really operate through influence, not through rank and title. Influence comes from the gravitas that people bring, not just as a person in their history, but what are you saying? Why you're saying it? So, we debate pretty hard, and people debate me. I get called out all the time. People who don't agree. I love that. And the reason is, I don't want to be wrong. So, people keep me safe from myself. It's much more important for the organization to be right than for me to be right.",1961
213,"Frank Slootman - Narrow the Focus, Increase the Quality",Narrowing Focus to Create Dazzling Products," Patrick: If I think about the influence that some of your writing and thinking's had on me, the idea of narrowing the focus is probably the single most powerful concept that I bring to everything now, as a result of reading your work. I'd love to apply this concept to products specifically. You've talked before about how products need to be astounding. You've appealed to jobs as notion that if something doesn't absolutely blow your face off, why are we bothering doing it? So, when you're evaluating a new product or considering a new product, what is your way of thinking through that narrowing of the focus, and the astounding potential of the product? Frank: We actually have a word that we use internally. It's called dazzling. That's like astounding, but even a more visceral in the sense that, when we do something, it doesn't matter whether that's a mundane feature. We always look for ways to rethink, reimagine. What would we do if we had nothing? What would we do if we weren't under time pressure? What is the best possible instinct for this thing? Sometimes it results into, well, how about not having it at all? I love those conversations. Why? Because it's just creative. It's inspiring, and it takes the drudgery. One of the things I talk about in the book is the whole war against incrementalism. I hate incrementalism, because it assumes the status quo, and it inches forward from there. It's a mind numbing way to go about your day. So, I'd much rather act like a startup. I have no history. I have no past. I have no customers. I have no install base. What would I do? Because, by the way, that's what your competition is doing. You might as well strap that one on, try it on for size. It's just a tactic and a mindset. It's very healthy. You talk about focus. I mean, I love to ask people. ""Yeah. Okay. It's February. If you can only do one thing this year, what would it be? And why?""When you ask people what their priorities are, you're going to get 10 or five. In other words, they can't whittle it down to one, because they're afraid they're wrong. I'm like, ""Yeah, I'm afraid you're wrong, too. That's the whole point of the exercise is that you might be wrong."" But if you have five or 10, you have none, so you've already lost at that point. It's all about amassing resources on as few things as possible. That's when you get momentum. You spread your resources a mile wide and this deep, you're already dead. You're always narrowing what I call the plane of attack. That's a concept in the world of cybersecurity. Fewer things to deal with is a very, very powerful thing. A lot of organizations can't get out of their own way because too much going on at the same time. Patrick: Is it possible, again, to play with the edges of these ideas to have too few things? So, especially at a company, let's say Snowflake's size, is one too few? I imagine there's more than one thing going on at Snowflake. So, where can you narrow the focus down to? Is it one thing per team, per company, per person, per leader? How do you think about that? Frank: It is more an exercise to determine a relative priority route than, ""Oh, we're only going to do one thing."" In reality that never happens. Certainly, in our organization at our scale, we have many work streams. We have many teams that are working on different things at the same time, for sure. But it's really healthy to step back and go like, ""What is the absolute most important thing that must happen this year?"" Because then becomes a more nuanced conversation of where are we going to shift the resources, if we have to shift resources because we're always resource constrained in engineering, because talent is a premium resource. We have to decide to put this person on this project or that project. How do we decide that? That's why you have these conversations. It's not so blatant. Like, ""Oh, only do one thing the rest of the year."" It's not. It is a conversation that creates clarity. And by the way, people are afraid they're wrong, and I'm okay with that. Let's try to be wrong. Then, because once you say what you think, now we can go and investigate whether that's correct or not. If you don't even do it, you're not even going to try and determine whether it's correct or not. You learn by trying things. And it's when you don't do anything, you learn nothing. That's why people put up temp priorities because they don't have to test their assumptions, because they're safe. I put everything up there I can possibly think of. Don't I sound smart now? Patrick: If you take that word dazzling and apply it instead to customers, who pops to mind as a dazzling customer that you've worked with? Because it's strikes me that picking your customer, or especially early on in the product and in the enterprise world, can really make a huge difference in the quality of the product over time. So, who comes to mind as a dazzling customer that you worked with and what made them dazzling? Frank: Well, one of the early customers that was really dazzling to us and still is, is Capital One. And I think it's pretty well advertised that they played a developmental role because they're a financial institution, obviously. And they have extraordinary requirements, both in terms of the computing infrastructure, the ability to replicate and fail. All things we didn't have when we first engaged with them in 2017. So, they really helped us. And also, the whole consumption model was completely new of the world. It wasn't for infrastructure and storage and servers, but it certainly was for us. It's like, ""How do you manage that?"" Otherwise it becomes a free for all and your bills will be sky high and all of that.And by the way, they're great. In the world of banking, by the way, you got institutions that are very, very far along digitally, like Capital One. There's a whole new generation of banks, they call them neo banks, or digital banks or whatever. They don't have any brick and mortar. They're just completely digital. And those are great, but then you also have traditional banks, and each now come from a totally different place. And then with the lessons that we learn from these very pioneering, leading edge banks, we then bring to these older institutions that they're much farther behind. We meet people where they are. Sometimes that's very advanced and sometimes that is very far behind. Patrick: If you think about another jobs idea, it was don't necessarily ask your customers specifically what they want and then build it like you should have some point of view. I've also seen you write about, back to incrementalism, not falling in the trap of just building great general purpose technologies, but actually working backward from an actual problem, and idealized outcome. Maybe just talk through that concept in a little bit more detail. The notion of how much opinion Snowflake, in this case, should have about what great product is versus asking customers what they want and building it, which seems like it could be an incrementalism trap. Frank: We're not a pure Steve Jobs play where he is like, ""I will tell you what you like when I show it to you."" By the way, I admired him greatly because he was always right or almost always right. But in our world, we do listen to customers and we do process their issues. Things like Global Search, which is a totally different type of work log from Snowflake. It's like looking for needles in a haystack, and particularly in security data. It's really, really important that we have customers that said, ""Look, in order for us to use that in security data, we need to have this, that, and the other thing."" And then we just scrambled to do exactly that. The whole replication, the global data mesh architecture also very much inspired by how customers needed to use the data all over the world. Not just in the single cloud region. So, we do an awful lot of listening. But again, this is a more nuanced conversation. Even when we listen and we hear what the problem is that the customer's trying to solve.And by the way, that distinction also matters a lot because you don't want customers to hand you the solution. You want them to hand you the problem. We then come up with the solution and it's not healthy when they say, ""This is what you need to do."" No, they need to say, ""This is the problem you need to solve."" Otherwise, you're constraining the possible outcomes already, prematurely. In other words, they have a view of what the solution is, as opposed to we may come up with very different approaches, back to the Steve Jobs example. He might have listened to problems and requirements and what have you, but then how he goes about that can take any number of forms, and that's where the innovation and where the spark happens.",2020
214,"Frank Slootman - Narrow the Focus, Increase the Quality",The Importance of Trust," Patrick: I love the idea of trying to solicit problems rather than solutions to be built, consultant or something from customers. It strikes me that trust, them trusting you, is probably the most critical, central ingredient to them being willing to give you problems rather than proposed solutions. So, how do you engender that trust between your company and a customer over time? Frank: Trust is a notion that permeates our whole organization, not just with customers, but with investors and employees and partners. It's every single stakeholder that we have. Trust is a huge thing. By the way, I just did a session with Pat Lancioni, who wrote the Five Dysfunctions of A Team. I don't know if you saw that. Recommend that people watch that because Pat, I think he is a legendary guy in terms of the organizational health thinking around trust being the foundation of absolutely everything. We're in such violent agreement about that. Because when you have trust, everything gets easy. And when you don't have it, everything gets, not just hard, but sometimes impossible. And then the question goes, ""How do you get trust?"" Because you don't just get it. You don't get the benefit of the doubt. Trust needs to be earned very studiously. And when I first came into Snowflake, you think people just trusted me when I walked through the door? No, he aint. They were incredibly distrusting. So, in other words, my whole behavior and how I communicated and how, in other words, they just keep score of everything you say and do. Does this have high fidelity or low fidelity? Are you true to what you're saying? And over time, when people saying, ""Yeah, this guy is consistently true and correct to me about stuff."" Then they start believing, face value, what you're saying and what you're doing. And the opposite is also true.By the way, you see it in government. Nobody believes what government says because they're wrong every single time. Never mind they're probably lying about it, too. So, you lose trust easily. I mean, you can lose it in a blink. But earning it takes a huge amount of time and effort, and many, many instances where you have to prove it. So, it's a very delicate and extremely valuable currency, and it exists in every walk of life. Whether it's your local sports team or whatever you're involved in, trust plays a role when you meet somebody. The first the reaction people have is, ""Do I trust this person?"" They may not ask that question explicitly of themselves, but it's visceral. You decide for yourself when we're getting into the right vibe or the wrong vibe. And then you try to corroborate your impressions based on interactions and actual experience. So, focusing on trust is a real thing I think is very, very important. I think a lot of people think they can say what they want and they're never going to be held to account. That ain't true. You will be held to account. You just may not realize it. Patrick: If we dig deep into trust and think about it, it's like core elements. The building blocks of it that are most basic, like the primary colors. What pops to mind, it would be, do what you say you're going to do. And clearly, have the other's best interest in heart. Are those two key ingredients for you? Are there other key ingredients that you would add to that list? How do you think about the base ingredients of trust when you deal with customers? Frank: I mean, they automatically say, ""Oh, you're a vendor. You're just trying to get the best of me."" You start with a deficit, especially with procurement people. Their whole world view is extremely distrusting. I always go to incredible lengths to behave in such a way that it's look, I've got your back. I don't leave anybody behind. And I use those words as well, right? Those words are visceral and they mean something and they convey the sentiment. Hearing it from me is incredibly important because I'm on the top of the house. This organization has my back. Can I trust what they're saying? People are asking me, look, I got to migrate these databases. How long does that take? What does that cost? What kind of risk am I running? Are you just going to tell me your stories so you can do another deal? And by the way, they often ask me the question, what don't I know? What should I know? This is a good question by the way. I'm telling them sometimes scary stories as well, because I'm trying to lift up the veil, light up the cave, if you will, to give them a sense of... This is new for a lot of people and the more truthful I am and the more transparent I am and the more willing I am to share difficult information, the more they're going to trust what I'm telling them. Pricing conversation, people want to know, am I getting a good price from you or not? How do I know? And I'm like, look, you are not going to get a special one off deal.I don't care how big you are and how big pf a deal you're doing with us, you're getting a price that is commensurate with the volume of business that you're doing with us. I need to have discipline in our of markets. I cannot have you find out from somebody else tomorrow that you are subsidizing somebody else's business or that somebody else is subsidizing you. We just can't have that. And I said, so I'd rather walk away than I go and screw up the discipline and the consistency and the integrity of our pricing. It's obviously helpful in negotiations because it's like no, we're not going to do a one up deal where you're better than everybody else just because we need it so badly. We're not doing it. But by the way, when companies start out early in life, that happens all the goddamn time, unfortunately, and then you have to live with it for the next 10 years because they got grandfathered in. And we have customers like that that are from way back when, 2015, and they have better pricing than anybody else. And then somebody finds out about it and they're like, why am I not getting that? Well, because you're not from 2015, okay. And we were ever since. Patrick: It's another great example of this sort of hold the line mentality, not just on focus, but on pricing and other places. It also seems like, back to that doing what you say you're going to do, that you can enhance that with another one of my favorite principles of yours, which is this idea of sequential rather than parallel effort or processing, or the idea that priority should be singular, it shouldn't be priorities. You've already mentioned that. Talk about that sequential versus parallel, and how that could help build trust and just build a better business in general. Frank: You can be parallel to a degree. If you're too parallel, you're what I call a mile wide and and inch deep and everything slows down. And by the way, human nature is to go highly parallel because we always pile stuff on and we never take stuff off. Things just get bigger and bigger and then we get frustrated because things are not getting done. Then we start making shortcuts. We're lowering our standards. You get all these problems that happen when you're too parallel in your approach. Sequentially, you get things done actually faster. And also the dynamic organization changes because you sort of have uncluttered the workload. You have crisped it up. You now understand the priorities and now you have the quality of bandwidth and the amount of resources that it needs to advance fast. As opposed to, I got so much going on. I'm just trying to get things off my desk now. And then we're doing a good enough.And sales organizations are notorious for pressuring engineering organizations into delivering things prematurely. We don't do that either. We're going to ship it when we're good and ready. Sorry. The pressure to make shortcuts is very, very great. And you need to have a lot of where for all and integrity in your organization to say, we're not going to succumb to that. And narrowing things down, whittling things down, again, it's a healthy process to reprioritize all the time. Really crisp up. What are we doing? Why are we doing it? And to reexamine, what are the reasons? Is that still valid? Once that clarity starts to surround the whole workload, everybody gets pep in their step. They are reenergized. They now know what to do, as opposed to wondering how should I even approach this? Just lightening up. It works in your personal life as well. You got 50 things on the list. I mean, come on. Let's do five, knock these things out in the next two hours. Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. Now we got energy. Yeah. This was really working.",1958
215,"Frank Slootman - Narrow the Focus, Increase the Quality",Having Technical Conversations and Supporting Sales Teams," Patrick: You mentioned engineering, which is I feel like even though we've matured tremendously, still somewhat of a black box to those that are non technical or aren't engineers themselves, and especially in the world of software, which is super complex. No one gets how complex it is. What have you learned about successfully translating between business people and engineering, which seems to be a zone of conflict often in software or technology businesses. Frank: It used to be true, certainly if I think years back, I mean, we had this enormous gap between the technology side and the business side. I just find that as time has progressed, the business side has become incredibly technical, to the point where they have an easy time having conversations with the technology side. In other words, you just can't live in this business anymore without being technical. It's impossible. So that gap has narrowed by necessity. That wasn't true in the mid eighties and all those times you had all these people that had no clue about software. So engineers did kind of roll their eyes. What the hell, you know? I mean, you have product managers that have to do the translation and then you get system analyst if you recall all those jobs that existed, they were translators between people that implemented and people that needed stuff. But now, and by the way, you see that in your large enterprises as well. It used to be IT was king of the hill, it still is in some place. But now business is just as technical as IT. So their roles are shifting and you get a much more balanced environment between what the business makes decisions on and what IT is really in charge of, because IT doesn't really know how to apply technology to the business, but the business does. We see that balance changing.And I have that conversation often, by the way, with CIOs who are your typical infrastructure guys, they manage for cost and risk and these kinds of things. But they're infrastructure people, they really are enablers, but they don't really know how technology impacts the business. The business does. And I mentioned Capital One as an example, they got 30 plus business units operating against a single Snowflake data platform. It's not IT that decides what these businesses are doing. Business decides whether they want to run this workload every night. Do they want to recalculate their auto loans once a month or every night? They decide that. They know what the business case for that is. IT has no business. And by the way, they get charged back for the cost of computing. So they pay for it. So they make those decisions. So it's a really good example in the role of IT and the role of businesses during their downs. IT does their thing and the business has grown enormously in terms of technology, sophistication, that's going to continue. Every business unit is going to be an expert data science team. You have to, because data is becoming the beating heart of a modern enterprise. I want to say digital enterprise, but that's the same thing. Patrick: You mentioned crossing the chasm earlier, which makes me think of effective sales organizations, because it seems like prior to the chasm, very often a founder can do a lot of the sales themselves, the founding team or a leader. And at some point you cannot grow as a business at the pace you want if the founder's doing that sort of thing. What have you learned about effective sales systems and organizations building these three companies? Frank: I've been quoted saying that it's better to sell nothing than something because if you sell nothing you can stick a bullet into it and move on and then reconstitute the resources, let people know at other companies that have viability and that when they have a handful of customers, they think they're viable. VCs of course, Patrick: Pump them full of dough. Frank: The founders, of course don't want to admit that either. They lack intellectual honesty. They just can't admit to themselves that this dog won't hunt. And of course, most dogs don't hunt. So way too many companies perpetuate out there and get money. And they are just the walking dead. I can't tell you how many conversations I've been in where people are like, oh, we're going to change the VP of sales or we're like, why? Well, we're not scaling. I'm like, how do you know it's the VP of sales? Could your product suck, might that be the reason? Because both of those problems are product problems. There's a real limit to what sales people can do. I hate to break it to you. They look at you horrified that you would even suggest that it might be something else. It's just a ridiculous conversation. It's this inability to look at things the way they really are versus the way they want them to be.You must be able to sell your way through it. Yeah, a founder can do it because they're very eloquent and they have all this visionary talk about the industry and the history and how they're going to change the future. And there is a sliver of customers, the early adopters, the classic early adopters in the Geoffrey Moore sense, buy that. But hell, they buy everything else too. Never seen anything like it in life, right? From the market. That's why it's before the chasm, not after the chasm. You have not crossed the chasm when you sell those people. You cross the chasm when you can sell mainstream marketplace, that's a whole different deal. You're no longer in business development, you're in sales and sales is a highly scalable, repeatable, predictable yield ramp type of process. It is completely different from business development, which is a one off approach. Every customer is a one off situation. Founders can often make sales and all situations, but don't confuse that with viability. Patrick: So let's assume we have a product that is great. And therefore we should be able to support a sales organization. How does something like compensation figure into getting more out of that organization? So all things product equal, they're a great and probably just good sales organization. So what distinguishes one from the other? Frank: Well, I mean, we've been running a very high velocity sales organization for the better part of the last 20 years. We view that as core competency. I mean the leadership, how we do that, I mean, we can write another book on that topic. That's an enormous topic. I just can't even begin to characterize it in a few sentences. Developing your own distribution capabilities is a very, very high value. Most companies think it's all about the technology. If you master your own distribution, you become insanely powerful. I mean, we really prove that at data domain, by the way, because the world of storage, everybody used OEM models because they wanted to sell EMC or Hitachi or IBM or HP. Why? Because hell, nobody wants to buy from a startup. Something as foundational as storage so there needed to be a big name behind it otherwise you just couldn't sell it. We came out with Data Domain. Of course, all the competitors we had, and there were a lot in that space, they all had OEM relationships. We decided, you know what? We're going to operate more like an enterprise software company. We're going to sell it ourselves. And we became insanely good at selling it ourselves. We learned how to manage to channel and all the dynamics that were in that side. We had a bigger exit than all other companies combined. We were 15 times the exit of the next company in the space. The point is there's huge value in mastering and controlling your own distribution. You own your own destiny. If you try to farm out your distribution, you're beholden to another entity. And I think that's incredibly unwise. I think over time, the marketplace has figured out that yeah, that whole OEM model has gone by the wayside.I mean, I've seen many storage companies come and go since that time that didn't go the OEM route. That's not in your DNA, selling. We're all selling all day long. If you don't realize that, you don't know what your job is. That has to be so important to you and demand generation and all the discipline that basically make up the drive train of the business. It is so incredibly important. You have to be a student of that. And it's a machine that has to be highly repeatable, highly scalable, and very predictable in terms of the yield versus investment that it takes. I talk in the book about the differences between being an embryonic company, where you just try to build a product that you hope has a prayer. The former stage is when you try to cross the chasm. You try to connect with the opportunity and build repeatability to the point where you can get to the other side of the chasm and you move to scale. Scale is a totally different mode than being in the formative stages where you're sort of in the desert looking for water, very opportunistically. That's not what happens in the world at scale. That is now massive systematization and methodical execution and the resourcing. One of the issues I have with Snowflake is Snowflake was a company that had clearly crossed the chasm when I got to it, but they were behaving like they still were in the chasm. I mean the insanity of that, they couldn't recognize when they had to shift gears. The opposite also happens. People are in the chasm, they try to scale, but they're not ready for it. So they waste immense amount of resources because they can't scale, they're not ready for it. So you see these impotence mismatches all the time. People think being in business is all the same thing, no, it changes dramatically from one stage to the other, the modes of execution.",2138
216,"Frank Slootman - Narrow the Focus, Increase the Quality",Principles for Growth and Sales Models," Patrick: If you think back on the three companies and think about the sales orgs in each, how different were they from each other? Or another way of asking the question is how much does the sales org need to kind of work backwards and be built according to the specific product versus there being some sort of general structure principles that sort of apply no matter what you're selling? Frank: There are principles and ways of thinking that transcends companies and eras and technologies and so on. But there is not a blueprint that you can just mindlessly project, what some people call a playbook, like, ""Here's how you do it."" And that's a real problem. When I first joined Snowflake, I mean, in disbelief, for the first I don't know how many weeks, about how mindlessly they were trying to scale a sales organization. They had a five-layer management model. What is this, IBM or something? Just absurd. What do these people even do? I mean, the most foundational questions they couldn't answer. Like, what are these people doing here? Management, by the way, in sales is by far the most important. I mean, you can rip out any other layer. But the combat unit, so direct reps and the first line manager, that's really what makes up a sales organization. Everything that comes above that, I call them the post office passing on the news. They were just slamming bodies to an org chart. And that is not how you add people in a sales organization. You know, like in the org chart, ""Oh, let's put somebody in sales today."" There is... Again, we're going to write another book about this, about how thoughtful you have to be. Because when you put people in territories, they need to have all the enablement and the leadership around them, the resource around them, so they can succeed. You can't just give somebody a bag and a quota and say, ""Tell me what you're going to close next month."" That is what people do.They think like, well, you send people out there, they'll figure it out. No, they won't. I've seen whole regions I call flat line. They're at zero, quarter after quarter after quarter. Why are you flat line? But once you go examine, ""Okay, what's going on there?"" You'll find out in a hurry why they're flat lining. And then we got other pockets that were ripping and roaring. Well, there were also reasons for that. In other words, just understanding how things work, it's really important, rather than mindlessly implementing a blueprint or a playbook. ""Do our playbook"" is the worst words I hear because it's... We just came off the Super Bowl. They think it's like a football team. You just throw a playbook at a company and, poof, they're successful. Unfortunately, a playbook's just the worst reflex because you want to throw the playbook out and be first principles and situational, and understand things as they are, and then go from there, rather than, ""Well, I've seen this before. I've done this before. Boom, boom, boom. Here we go."" The founders of Data Domain started another company after Data Domain. Data Domain was an insanely successful company, still to this day. They just decided that... We weren't around anymore because we're at Service Now. That, ""We're just going to do exactly what Data Domain did, hire the same people, do things the same way."" I mean, almost unbelievable. Patrick: Run the playbook. Frank: Me and my side ways for 10 years, burned an enormous amount of capital, and was sold for asset value because they just think like, ""How hard can this be? Let's do the same stuff and it'll work."" No, it won't. Patrick: I've seen you talk a lot about board accountability and asking the question of, ""What is your growth model?"" like every quarterly meeting. That and what other questions are great for board members to ask their leaders and their CEOs? Frank: Growth is incredibly important. Not just because we like to be a high-growing company and a great evaluation and all that, but growth is what separates the winners from the losers. That's how you get into a winner takes all, winner takes most type of model. Growth is strategically important in any way you can think about it. So, if growth is not in your mind, at least in our world, you don't know what your job is. It creates value. It creates a strategic separation. So it's a pretty damn important question to ask is, ""Okay, what are the limits of growth and what aren't they?"" Not how much. What can you do to drive your growth to higher levels? And when I first interviewed with Service Now, they were growing close to 100% a year, and they were immensely... Which I can understand, because it is a lot. But I was just asking very innocently, ""Could you grow faster?"" And they were incredibly pissed off about that question from this guy from Silicon Valley. I didn't mean to piss anybody off. I just wanted to understand how they thought about it. Well, they hadn't thought about it. It's just something that happened because they tried real hard, and this is what happened, but there was no mindset.And by the way, I mean, the other thing about Service Now is they were so under-resourced at every turn, insanely. They had a founder CEO, really good guy, by the way, but the CFO was fundamentally running the company on a day-to-day basis. And they had put $15 million in the bank from operations. They just weren't investing. They just weren't. They hit like 16 quarter carrying reps to start the end. At the end of the year, they still had 16 quarter carrying reps. Never mind the business had doubled. Sales productivity was great, and they were proud of it. It's actually stupid, you know. In high growth companies, sales productivity should be turning sideways or down. That's how you know you're hiring fast. It's like, look, I found that stretching and leaning and harder and harder and harder will reveal to you what your growth model really is, because this is a very hard question to answer. But trying it is going to teach you where the limits are. And I have never overdone it in terms of leaning in. I have done it in hindsight many times because I, just like other people, I was a little skittish and afraid that we're pouring out so much resources and then we can't convert on it. That's the reason why people don't do it. But you need to explore these boundaries. How far can I go? And what are the signals that I can't possibly get where I'm overdoing? By the way, if you're still in the chasm, you're overdoing in a hurry because you're not ready to apply resources, and you'll have sales productivity problems up the wazoo. That's very common.But even in scale, companies that are ready to scale, what are these limits? And then by the way, can you push these limits out? When you lean in harder, I mean, if you're finding these boundaries, you're now also learning how to move those boundaries. You think there's a reason why Snowflake gets more than a billion dollars off revenues, currently still growing north of 100%? It hasn't happened in the history of enterprise software to grow at that level of scale. There's lots of reasons why that happens. Okay? Because when you break down growth and all the different elements that go into it, I mean, all of them have to be thought about, managed and resourced. I'll give you an example. I mean, one of the things that we insist on in... And I say 'we' because it has to be an organizational thing. Everybody shows up every quarter. The one thing that I don't want to hear is like, ""Well, in Australia, in January, everybody's on vacation. Or in August, everybody in Europe is on vacation."" Don't care. Everybody shows up every quarter.There is not an excuse for not showing up. It's a discipline. It's a mindset. It's a commitment. It's not like, ""I'll make it up later in the year."" We don't have years. We only have quarters. A quarter is like a year. Excuses, you know, when COVID happened, very quickly, I started to get COVID, COVID, COVID. So I don't want to hear that word anymore. Okay? COVID doesn't exist as far as we're concerned. And by the way, the company has blasted through COVID like there's no tomorrow, because the moment you allow that in your head, you're dead already. There are many ways to instrument an organization that it knows what is expected. You end up on a much higher growth trajectory than you could possibly imagine, because growth is not mystery. It's just mechanical. It's just what can you do? How quickly can you do it? What's the productivity? What's the ramp? What's the conversion? It's something that you can break down and improve upon over time. That's the conversation that should happen in board meetings, but, ""Oh, we grew 30%,"" and then they're high-fiving and doing a victory lab. That's just nonsense. Why is it not 50% is the real question or 100%? Pick a number. Patrick: Not all analogies are perfect. They'll often fall down. I'm curious to hear where you think the analogy of business as war falls down. I'm thinking of the Highlander analogy I've seen you put out there, which I absolutely love. I'd love you to tell people that one, because I think it's a good example of compounding benefits to the market leader. So maybe mention that, what you mean by Highlander as a concept, and what the limits are to this concept of business as war, if any. Frank: Government can print money, and they do plenty of it. The rest of us, we have to take it from somebody else. And once you come to that realization, you also find out that they're not going to take kindly to the fact that you're taking this from them. So, and the bigger you get, now you become a looming threat and they'll fight back with everything they have. It does feel like war, and not war in the sense that people are going to die, but companies are going to die. Companies are dying every day. Then they don't reach viability. And then a lot of old ones that were successful, ones that are basically decaying on the vine, I mean, how many of those do we have out there?It is a very visceral battle, but the way you know you're winning, first of all, you need to define what winning is. I've always quoted US Grant and other people. They defined victory as breaking the enemy's will to fight. It was not just kill them. It was breaking their will to fight. You can do that in a number of ways. But in a world of software, you break the enemy's will to fight when you are hiring their people because they have given up. They'd rather be with you than they are with the other company, because it's too hard and too painful and they're not making money. So, ""I'm going to join the winner instead of stick with delusion."" That happens in our world all the time. That is the Highlander analogy because every time the Highlander kills another Highlander, he takes on the strength of the other Highlander. The same thing is true in software. If I'm hiring a top salesperson, top engineer from another company, I've taken their strength now into my organization. It's not just that I gained theirs, but they lose theirs. So it's a double impact. I weakened them and I strengthened myself. Patrick: You've done a lot of honing of your methods across a number of companies, a lot of years. What do you think still you have left to hone. Like, as you think about continuing to improve the apparatus, what has you most interested in terms of improvement? Frank: Well, everything is overall around talent. That's never ending. I never think I have arrived at a place where, oh, declare victory now. It's just we are too paranoid and too high of fear of failure to ever allow ourselves to think along those lines. Yeah, we've had really good runs and great companies and all of that. That's great, but who cares? Okay, we're in a new dynamic now. So it is like when you start a new quarter. Nobody cares what you did last quarter. That's a healthy dynamic. But the talent game is really, really hard, and it's the lifeblood of an enterprise. You cannot run companies with mediocre people. You simply can't. You're not going to make it. You're not going to survive. It's absolutely everything. And there is not that much of it. Patrick: You remind me of one of my favorite Isaac Asimov quotes that, ""Past glories are poor feeding."" One of the quotes on my desk. Frank: Well said, well said. Yeah. Patrick: This has been a ton of fun. I ask everyone that I talk to the same traditional closing question. What is the kindest thing that anyone's ever done for you? Frank: The kindest thing that people ever done for me, I mean, they hired me. My personal history, being a foreigner in this country and speak with a fat accent, or more so 30 years ago than now, I have credentials they couldn't even pronounce, let alone understand what they meant. People need to take a chance on you. One of the reasons that I'm a fierce executor, where that comes from is that I had to take on really lousy opportunities and then massively exceed expectations in order to be viable as a person in business. That's where that ferocious mentality comes from, because I didn't have mainstream credentials, and I couldn't make my way into the business world in this country the way everybody else did. So, when people took a chance on me, they really took a walk on the wild side.Is that the kindest thing? Yes, it is because they took personal risk. When I got hired in my first CEO job... I'm still immensely grateful. It was there at Greylock, who's obviously the CEO of Workday, founder of Workday. And then Scott Sandell was at NEA. They decided, ""Yeah, this guy, he ain't going to lose."" Took a chance. And then obviously things get better and better from there on. It's not a coincidence that my career took off once I got my first CEO job. And then the reason is it lent itself to my natural intuitions and reflex. In other words, I didn't need to be held back anymore. Patrick: Well, Frank your writing and thinking has sharpened my own and I'm sure many others. I really appreciative for your time today.

217,Tim Flannery - Simplifying Fund Closing,Introduction," Patrick: My guest today is Tim Flannery, co-founder of venture fund administrator Passthrough. Passthrough is removing friction from the manual, time-consuming fundraising process by making investor onboarding as set simple and automatic as possible. Passthrough software helps investors fill out subscription documents in minutes rather than hours, and allows GPs to easily track LP subscriptions during a fundraise. Our conversation discusses the power of identity as a feature to build products around, the double-edged sword of solving an unsexy problem, and how Passthrough has thought about pricing their software. Please enjoy my conversation with Tim Flannery.",138
218,Tim Flannery - Simplifying Fund Closing,Reducing Frictions in Investing," Patrick: Tim, we were talking before hitting record, and you said something just there and I told you to stop because maybe it's the right place to start our conversation, which is this notion that if you think about the complex Yale endowment models, the fanciest of asset allocation investing models out there in the world, the ability to do that sort of thing maybe working its way down, all the way down to the individual. There's this democratization of ways that you can invest, types of investors, different kinds of backgrounds of GPS out there. We're going to talk a lot today about what's happening in the world of investing, but maybe that concept is a great wedge to begin our conversation. What are you seeing that leads you to say that what Yale can do perhaps at some point soon the individual will be able to do? Tim: There's a couple of things happening. The very practical examples of this is, one, AngelList has continued to develop products, and so companies like Allocations and Carta and everybody else that's building these things that allow fund managers to get off the ground quickly. These fund managers, because they're new to the environment, it means that they know different investors. And so first, there's this poll where the managers themselves, they have their own network, they can go bring it in. And the second is a push. About a year and a half, two years ago, Partners Group, huge, huge private equity firm lobbied the Department of Labor to change regulations around ERISA requirements.Individual ERISA plans weren't allowed to invest in private funds, then all of a sudden, in June of, I think it was 2020, they issued a letter that said, ""Actually, sure you can start taking IRAs in."" And so then companies like AltoIRA have exploded. First, they have opportunities to do this in tax advantaged ways. Then they're actually looking for those opportunities. And so this dates back all the way to the Jobs Act where everybody's just been trying to modernize the infrastructure around this and increase access. There's just this continual trend of institutional products that are available to non-institutional investors, both the allocator side and on the fund manager side. So we're seeing people left and right, ""I have all of this pent up demand or I have all of this pent up capital that I want to deploy, but how do I make it happen?"" Patrick: Maybe we could go all the way to the end and then all the way to the beginning. One thing I'm obsessed with as we've talked to you is just the nature of frictions in the world of investing, all the things in the middle between a pool of capital and an asset or something that's purchased at the end, there's just lots of regulation, there's lots of process, there's lots of standards. There's not much software, although that's changing. Go all the way to the end for us. What is the idealized end state in your opinion. If Passthrough and other companies that are trying to reduce frictions in this world are maximally successful, what does the world of investing look like 10 years from now relative to today? Tim: The way that we got to see this friction really up close and personal was through subscription documents and the nightmare is for, not just convincing people to invite in your fund, but how to actually make it happen. We saw that there was some issues around essentially, it's the same information that's being used over a different context. And so if we could go fix subscription documents by capturing this investor information and allowing the investor themselves to own and control it, repurpose it, we think that there's all these hidden processes they're not even aware of that's distributing their information. Today, it's through PDF and it's through all this manual verification work. And so, at least our aim, what we want to do is we want to centralize that, give them control of it. The simplest version of it is, if you want to go log into a website, you can click a button and log in with Google. And if you want to go invest in the private markets today, you're getting a 200-question questionnaire and you're trying to figure out how to go answer it.But what if all your information was stored somewhere and you could just click log in with Passthrough? And then what you can do is you can turn investing into private equity, venture, hedge, whatever, into something that's reduced to buy now, one-click investing, one-click whatever it is that you need to do to understand who has access to your information, what levels are you granting? It's giving control back to the investors. You used the word friction, it's removing friction from fund managers, certainly enough to convince people to invest in your funds for lots of fund managers. So why don't you just make it simple enough that when somebody invests into fund, that you can just go collect the capital and get to work doing the thing that they're paying you for, which is making good investments. Patrick: The friction, I guess, is there's probably a lot more potentially useful, good, whatever term you want to use, fund managers that aren't active because they don't have escape velocity to escape these current frictions of convincing their LPs or whatever that they're a good investor, but that it's worth the effort to get going. If I think about that question of what's the promised end state, if there's someone that deserves or belongs as a professional fund manager, there's really nothing in their way of being one from a red tape standpoint. Tim: Totally correct. The reason that you're a fund manager, part of it is because you're good at convincing people to give you capital, but the main reason is because you're good at deploying the capital. And so let's reward you for the things that you're good at instead of having to have you focus on everything else that's not core to your business. There's two things, one is, it means that I might not have had the opportunity to go out and build this on my own because the amount of time, the amount of energy, I don't have the expertise for it. That could be something that holds me back. But the second thing that can happen is, people that are already are professional fund managers, it allows them to move with greater speed. And it doesn't matter if you are an emerging manager or if you're tiger, you're still dealing with the same annoying processes. Patrick: Can you give us a history lesson of the major frictions through time, those that have fallen and those that remain in this world? Like you mentioned the Jobs Act, I don't know if that's the right first place to go, the role of angel is etc. But give us what you view as the key moments in history that have mattered to get us to where we are today, and the key barriers regulatory or otherwise, obviously you've already addressed the one of the friction of onboarding that Passthrough is dealing with. But give us that history lesson and what barriers remain to a frictionless version of the investing world. Tim: The best point of view I have from this is from my time at Carta. What we'd seen was that the private market space was this niche industry where there were a number of players and there was a number of investors. And because there was just this smaller subset of people, there was all these inefficiencies from how to go out and execute a close and open up your bank account and handle all your compliance work and everything else. But then we saw a couple of things happening we talked about a little bit earlier. One is that we're seeing more and more investors that are coming in. And so operations that were set up to be able to handle the 20 or 30 institutional LPs can't handle the giant RIAs with thousands of clients that want to go deploy into them. And so first we saw that there was more investors that started coming in. And so that started putting strain across all of the operational processes that people were doing across the firm. The second thing that we saw was that there was increased regulatory pressure. So it wasn't just that you were bringing people in, but private funds continue to be held to a higher standard. They're not treated like banks today, they don't have the same KYC, AML requirements as broker dealers, but everything that's happening, it doesn't even matter what your domicile is, what your regulatory regime is, we're seeing more and more pressure on people.Carta started first off by doing a little bit of standardization on the venture side, where we could take a look at all of our investments as a fund manager and understand what we owned and what the broader context of the performance over time. And we got to see the consolidation of that portfolio too. That starts to give fund managers a new view of what it is that they own, which allows them to just a better insight real time. Then we saw things on the company side, which is a little bit less relevant to the conversation, but anytime that there's an inefficiency with your companies, this also spills over into what you're doing as a fund manager. And so Carta allowed people to actually go out and manage everything. And then we saw Carta start to build all these other tools in the investor services side. The parallel on the company side was a 409A. 409A was this thing that you used to have to go out and pay a analyst to prepare for you and it was this expensive, still annoying process that nobody really got major value out of, it was just a requirement. And so Carta managed to take that and turn it into software. And then Carta found other things that they could start to turn into software too. So they took this from a 409A for a company to an ASC 820, so fair market valuations for financial reporting for you as a fund manager.So when you start to do things like that, they put pressure on the rest of the industry. First of all, I think you saw a collapse of a lot of competitors in the space that were unable to adapt at times, but you also saw that people were forced to have a technology solution. It really brought the entire industry forward. And then there's all sorts of other work that Carta and iLEVEL and everybody else was doing around portfolio company data collection. And then it was, ""All right, well, I want to be an emerging manager,"" and we talked about this a little bit earlier, ""How do I actually just go stand up this fund?"" What I know how to do is I know how to go find good companies, I know how to go do whatever the reason is that I want to go out and be a manager. And so Carta eventually started building tools that allowed people to do this through software. They did it with a fund administrator, they did it with a SPV in the box offering, they did it with a variety of different solutions, and now you're seeing them all over the place. It allows people to just go out and focus on their investment returns rather than on their back office. And so we saw this broader trend across the privates, really, I think dating back to... There's something about Sarbanes-Oxley to this, there's also something about financial crisis and people getting lean with their fees.I started my career at JP Morgan in the fund administration group. Strangely enough, my life took me back to fund administration at Carta, I never thought it would. Even then, we saw that there was this trend of people outsourcing it because it was more fee efficient and it was also a little bit more risk efficient. And so part of it is regulatory, but regulatory has driven the need. The way that it's been solved today has primarily been through service. And what I love seeing with Carta is, Carta started solving it with software. And so that's our point of view too, it's, we think that there's lots of room to go out and drive efficiencies across all of these different things so that when Sima and the Caymans comes out and says, ""Well, here's this other new thing that you need to do that you didn't need to do last year,"" then you can just have something that handles it for you without having to do a total scramble, hire a new person and find a new provider. It shouldn't be the case, it's all the same information that's moving back and forth anyways.",2683
219,Tim Flannery - Simplifying Fund Closing,Passthrough's Origin Story," Patrick: Can you tell the origin story of you and your co-founders, your time together at Carta, and what the spark of insight or the first risk movement was to create Passthrough? I'm always interested in why people go to do something new and hard and different. So in the case of Passthrough, what was that story like? What do you think of as the key episodes in that early story? Tim: My partners, Alex and Ben joined Carta after the series A and series B, I joined after the series C. And they helped launch initially the investor services group. And so it includes the ASC 820 and portfolio, the data collection stuff. And they also helped launch fund administration. And so Carta's fund administration was meant to be, and is meant to be a software-driven approach to it. And like most things at Carta, it was growing really quickly. And when things were growing really quickly, how do you onboard new funds? What you do is you take these executed subscription agreements. And again, for context, the subscription agreement, if you wanted to go invest in Apple today, you could go sign up on Schwab or on Robinhood in two minutes, and then you could be investing in Apple and everything else that's out there. If you wanted to go invest in the latest private fund, whatever, instead, they give you a 50-page, 100-page, 100-question, 200-question questionnaire where there's no standard and not every question applies to every investor. Even professional investors are filling things out incorrectly all the time. And the state of the art on is pen and paper. So when we were onboarding new funds, we would get these emerging managers with 100 investors and then had to stand up a team that was taking information out of these subscription documents and getting them into an Excel file to go upload them into our investor portal.It was unstructured. And he was so confused the rest of the world was getting structured data, but somehow sub docs were still trapped in the '90s. This unstructured data was a problem for our team at Passthrough. Who else was it a problem for? It was a problem for the law firms, because they need to pull out all sorts of information so they can tell you status of the raise, understand the different risks that your investors are bringing in. It's important for fund managers who need to get into their CRMs. The fund managers then also have the fun task of trying to understand where they are and the raise at any given time. And so once you send out a PDF, how do you actually know what your status is? How can you run an effective sales process with that? And then, not only do you need to run an effective sales process, you need to coordinate all the pieces of the race. So how do you make sure that your compliance team, your fund admin, your law firm, your team, your investor, are all talking the same book? And the investor is the worst experience of all, I highlighted it earlier. Good luck to filling these things out correctly the first time. And so Ben had this insight that, ""Look, there's definitely a workflow that you could build here to make this better and solve, really just the issue of executing these sub docs.""We take any subscription document, we build out this workflow where investors only see the questions that matter to them and they see every question that matters to them. It looks a lot like TurboTax. And so that way, there's no such thing as an incomplete subscription agreement and the chances that somebody makes an error go down dramatically. And so he had this sense of, great, there was a workflow to go build it. I actually didn't join as one of the initial founders, I joined about a year later in the company's life. And when Ben had approached me about joining, I was like, ""Well, this feels like a feature. I don't understand why this is actually a venture backable business."" And he had this insight that there was some things that were really attractive about it. First was, it's hyper efficient distribution. Every time you onboard a subscription document, a fund manager is telling you, ""Hey, go out, meet my investors, provide a really, really good experience for them. And if those investors have a really good experience, those investors might be fund managers, they might be investors in other funds."" And so it just generates leads left and right. Patrick: There's a network component to it. Yeah. Tim: We saw something similar with cap tables, we knew that lesson really well. The thing that really got me excited about though was, ""Great, we can acquire new business easily."" But the fun thing is that just by having somebody fill out a subscription document, we get to capture their identity. Subscription documents ask for all sorts of information like, ""Who are you? Where do you live? Who are your contacts? Why are you accredited and available to invest in this fund? Why are you qualified? Are you subject to Freedom of Information Act?"" All of these different things. And this information is repurposed across a million different contexts. So it's used for KYC, AML, it's used to screen an investor against a sanctions list to determine whether or not they might be laundering money through your fund. It's used for regulatory reporting purposes. It's used for banking purposes. When you want to open up a bank account as a fund manager or apply for a line of credit.Everybody was doing was the same thing that we were doing with Carta, which is taking these executed sub docs and exchanging PDFs. And everybody was doing this exact same verification process that was taking days or weeks, and it was all tied to the unstructured data. And besides being really efficient, what we do was we capture this information, we allow an investor to own it and control it. First we can allow them to repurpose it across subscription documents, which we have available today in a limited way, but then allow them to repurpose it across other contexts. So think about it like an investor passport. So you want to go have KYC performed on you? Why should it be performed 50 different times? That's inefficient for the tire system. And so when we start to remove all those inefficiencies, it actually changes the way that the private markets flow and function. And so that felt big. That felt really big. And it just felt like it was a worthwhile product to go build.",1393
220,Tim Flannery - Simplifying Fund Closing,Defining Investor Identity," Patrick: What have you learned from Okta? Okta Ventures I know as an investor of yours. Obviously, there's a common trait there of focusing on identity, maybe even abstracted the way just from investor identity. Why is identity as a thing to build around so powerful? It just seems like a really neat thing where we've heard a lot of people talk about your investor identity is one thing, but everyone's identity is chopped up and linked into one version of identity. Facebook's one version of identity. It's this incredibly powerful force in general, in network-based businesses. What have you learned about from Okta about this concept of identity and why it's so powerful? Tim: What we learned from Okta was that a lot of automation is tied to identity, and there's all sorts of different cuts to identity. If you can take a look at what Okta does, they say, ""Well, who is this employee? What are the certain things that they're allowed to do?"" Also, they do some work around, ""Who are your customers? How can you start to identify that this customer's the same as that customer and make more intelligent decisions?"" And so it actually changes the way that not just you manage your security and infrastructure, but the way that you might manage your marketing and your outbound. And so whether it's the context of Okta that's doing that or different context, managing my logins as an individual in one password, just by having it centralized, first of all, there's control. Second of all, there's speed. Third of all, there's reduced risk of error and exposure. And as we continue to live more and more of what we're doing online, then being able to actually own to control it is a really important feature. And it's something that just allows businesses to move quicker. And we've seen this broader trend of the private markets continuing to look more and more like the public markets. The reason that we got really excited about bringing on Okta and a number of their executives directly into the round was because we saw that they'd been incredibly successful doing this in one environment, and we wanted to see how they could help us reapply this learnings in another environment. They've been unbelievably helpful partners for us. Patrick: Maybe to extend it even further, if you think about Okta, which is fundamentally like a developer-facing programmatic API type consumption business, do you think that there's a future for Passthrough like that too? Because today, as I think about the product, you've already said it, TurboTax from the LP or user's perspective and then tracking, dashboarding on the other side for the GP or the sponsor's perspective, it's SaaS today. What do you think versions of this that get deeper in the tech stack, I guess I'll call it, and really play off that identity even more could look like, or is that not part of the plan? Tim: It's absolutely part of the plan. There's a couple different ways to look at it. One is, what are people doing that are manual processes and it's done by individuals and teams and those teams could be repurposed to go out and do things that are more profitable for the business? Fund closing is one of them. There's tons of law firms and fund admins. Law firms are taking first, second, third year associates and they've graduated from law school and they're chasing down signatures. It's a terrible use of their time. They hate it. With fund closing, it's the first application of how we can take these workflows that exist throughout funds in the private markets and we can automate them. If I was building a modern day law firm or I was building a modern day fund administrator or I was building a modern day tech platform that was in the space, what I probably want to do is make sure that I could handle investor onboarding in some way that didn't look like I was doing it 15 years ago at JP Morgan, I'd want to be able to do it with software. And so I think there's some component of this that's we can have a programmable interface for the way people do this.And so our API allows people to go out and not have to worry about, ""How do I go fix sub docs?"" And instead it's,, ""How do I just have a really pleasant experience for my user, whether I'm a startup or whether I'm a service provider or whatever the context, have a really pleasant experience for them without having to solve what on the face of it looks like an easy challenge to solve sub docs, but it's way harder than people think it is."" So that's one. And the second part is, we talked about this with the investor passport analogy. There's also some data element. There's not just investor onboarding, but I as an investor am constantly asked for information about who has access to my information. I have a new CPA, a new lawyer, I've got a new treasury team, I have a new set of banking instructions. First of all, it's a nightmare to be able to handle all that information. Second of all, if you don't handle it correctly, then you've got information that's getting shared to the wrong people or worst case. You've got a wire that's going out the wrong place. And so there's some data element to this as well, where an investor can permission all of these different people to have access to this data on a real time as-needed basis. It actually brings down the risk of running a provider, of running a fund, of everything else. Patrick: What do you think the exhaustive inventory is of current nightmare undifferentiated, heavy lifting problems like Sub docs and KYC, AML. Are those the two biggest ones or are there lots of other ones that tie directly or adjacently to this investor identity concept that you think you'll ultimately tackle? Tim: We know that there's a lot of wood chop in the space from firsthand experience. And so it really is anything from, I'm a fund manager., one of my companies exited, I need to go distribute capital. The thing that you don't see as a fund manager is that your fund administrators reaching out to all of your investors to reconfirm their wire instructions because those wire instructions are two years old. Same thing with, if you have somebody who is transferring an LP interest or all these other things that are like the constant changing state of the fund, there's a million of them that you're handling directly as a fund manager, whether it's through your finance or your IR team that your law firm is handling, or your fund admin is handling and everybody's doing it manually. The other part of it that's interesting too, is besides the traditional providers that are doing it, take a look at a company like iCapital. iCapital, the way that they make money is by matching money with fund managers.The way that they don't make money is by making sure investors can sign up quickly and easily. And so what we can do is, even this one simple workflow of, how do you help somebody sign up with a fund, regardless of the context, is immensely important across all these different people that are trying to make money in a million different ways. And so even this little thing of, ""How do I make sure that my contacts are up to date?"" That's very applicable outside of these specific relationship that you have as a fund manager with your service providers. It's also applicable to, ""I am a founder that's trying to build in this space, and why would I want to waste my engineering time on something that should be a solved problem?"" And so it's the same thing that Plaid did with financial transaction verification. There's hooks that they've built in so that we don't need to do ACH test deposits, and that has transformational impacts on our business. And that transformational impact is felt all the way from firms like Carta, people that have just decided to build on it from the ground up. Patrick: What does it feel like as a repeat LP customer today? And what is the idealized end state of that experience? If I go through one of these onboarding flows, I'm answering the relevant questions to me only, you're capturing that. I then go and want to do sub docs to a second fund that also uses Passthrough. What does that feel like today for the LP the second time? Tim: Good news, the first time is actually better than you think it is too. Here's what the first time can be, and then let's start to talk about the second timers. The first time, the world record fastest subscription document that we've ever had somebody fill on our platform from scratch correctly, six minutes. And that's a process that normally takes hours of collaboration across me, my lawyer, my CPA, everybody else that I need to help fill out my documents. So if that's the experience that we can have for somebody the first time, the second time can do way better. If we can start at six minutes and then we've passively captured this information, what we can do today, like we can do it in a limited context. In some cases, we can prefill an entire subscription document, in some cases, we're pre-filling sections of a subscription document. We can take the information that you've already submitted and when you log in, it works like DocuSign, you're just going through your email, you're then presented with all of your information about your investor profile, about your investor passport. And if you want to invest through it again, you just confirm that that's all the same, click a button, and then get to execution. The length of time that it's going to take a subscription document to be executed on a repeat investor, right now, we've actually trying to get to about three minutes. That's pretty fast, but the limit on this is how quickly can we get the DocuSign model to pop up so that I can then click and sign? That's our limit. Patrick: I'm always interested in the nitty-gritty of the product. So right now, from a GP side, I get this much more manageable, how far through the process, it's like an actual legibility into the sales process so I can go tell so and so they need to get moving or something. And that's facilitated by this. Do you also see the other being valuable? So I think one of the powerful things about Carta is because it becomes a standard as a VC, you might say, ""Okay, I log into Carta to see my whole portfolio. It's a central system of record or system of truth."" Do you think that this becomes that for LPs too? So if I'm an LP in 20 funds, it's like the equivalent of me being a VC looking at Carta, but now I'm looking at my LP interest or something across the fund, so it becomes a utility from a dashboard perspective, not just a docs perspective to the LP too? Tim: There's an element of that. There's lines that we don't want to cross. We don't want to become a service provider, we want to work with service providers. We don't need to go out and build an investor portal, we want to work with investor portals. And so our philosophy on this is you've already chosen your teams, you've chosen your tools, why do you want to replace them? Maybe you do, but choosing Passthrough shouldn't force you to choose to dump one of your teams. There's some element of, yes, here's the central place where I have all of my information, and what I want to be able to do is talk to people all the time, where they have a profile on AngelList, profile on Carta, on allocations, on like 50 other places where you can go and invest right now. And so the experience that we want is that you don't have to worry about this focalization of your identity across 50 different platforms, we want you to just be able to have it in one place. That way, you can see who you are and where this information goes and how to control it. But our goal isn't that we're going to be able to go out and show the performance of everything. We're not going to do your books and records, we're not going to handle your audit. What I want to do is that when it's tax season, that information's in there and it's simple to go and grab, instead of having to deal with everything else that's out there.",2713
221,Tim Flannery - Simplifying Fund Closing,How to Become Great at Distribution," Patrick: I'd love you to tell us everything you've learned about distribution. You have a lot of personal history in that function inside of companies. I think the distribution strategy which you've referenced around, like the network based advantages of that for something like Passthrough are really interesting, but I'd love to just hear your masterclass on what great sales and distribution looks like to you in general, but also through the context of a product like this that's dealing with identity, that's dealing with workflows, the infrastructure level. Give us a lesson here because this obviously is an area where you've built a lot of expertise over the years. Tim: There's pieces that are tactical and strategic. Tactical pieces can start with, I'm hopping on a call as a salesperson, and I might even have an unqualified prospect that I'm talking to, but I know that the network is tight and maybe this isn't a problem that solves them. The very tactical thing you can do is before you get off the call and say, ""Hey, my name's Tim. I'm one of the co-founders here. I'd be a terrible co-founder if I didn't ask you, I know that this isn't fit for you, but is there anybody else you know that we should be talking to?"" And so really simple tactical thing is important because like people know like people, you know lots of fund managers, fund managers know lots of fund managers, LPs know lots of LPs. And the context for that is universal, it's not just within the fund manager space, but it's especially powerful in the fund manager space. Patrick: Meaning like build the pipeline as part of process of selling individual customers? Tim: Absolutely too. Couple of things you learn from that, first of all, who to go talk to, second of all, you took something that might have been a wasted call and you've turned it into a new lead. What's a better use of time than that? And there's all sorts of other opportunities to go out and ask for referrals, and so that's deeply embedded in our business. Somebody has a successful fundraise with us, which they all do, we say, ""Hey, we know that you just had a successful raise is there anybody else you know that's raising right now that we should be able to help with?"" And so everybody knows somebody else that's raising because everybody's trying to solve the same problems together. And so that's really tactical. The other thing that's tactical is, and this is again, specific to the context of the private markets, there's a set of service providers. And this is actually where we got to know the problem of sub-docs in the first place is through these service providers. And so I've selected a law firm, I have a trusted council that helps advise me on a variety of things. My council tells me, ""You should go check out Passthrough,"" I'm probably going to go take that meeting. If I've evaluated a fund administrator and I like the work that they do and they say, ""Well, what do you think about looking at this product?"" I'm going to go take the meeting. And so great, perfect again, very tactical.So create a good experience for those other parties, treat them like customers and you're going to go out and do pretty well on that. Then there's stuff that's a little bit product driven. We talked about this earlier. An investor in your fund could be a fund manager, could be an investor, could be in an IR team, could be in a million of different places. Create a simple, approachable, easy way to go out and execute a sub-doc, because at the end of the day, what's the sub-doc? It's just this legal document you got to fill out so that everybody can go out and try to earn some money. And so let's just make it really easy. Then they move on and then they're done and then that's the whole thing. And so we've made a lot of design choices to make that simple for people. Investors, we want them to get moving really fast so they come on board through email, again, like you would with DocuSign, you have a magic link that allows you to get moving really fast. You can bring in your collaborators, you're only seeing a subset of questions, you're not getting blinded by the 200 questions that are out there, whether or not they apply to you. You're getting this guided tour through this complex agreement that if it's your first time investing in the privates, you're not going to fill it out correctly. There's just effectively, no chance that you can. And so cool, create a really good experience. And then that's just going to naturally turn into other things. Patrick: What does bringing your collaborators mean? Tim: I am an individual, I'm a high-net-worth individual. I'm an ultra-high-net-worth individual, I don't fill out my sub-docs, all I do is sign the things the end. So I might have my lawyer, I might have my CPA, I might have variety of people that are filling out things on my behalf. It might be my trustee because it's an IRA, it might be all these different places. There's this really annoying problem of collaboration between every party. And so, yeah, it's between the fund manager and the investor, and the law firm, and the fund admin, and compliance team, and your IR team, and the list goes on and on, and it's totally configurable depending on context. So that's an annoying problem, but even within these groups, there's all sorts of work that needs to happen. I'm an investor, I need to make sure that I've got my CPA filling out this one piece, I need to make sure that my accountant's filling out this other piece.And then I need to get alerted that, ""Hey, it's time for me to actually go out and execute these documents too."" It's like a vertical problem, it's not a horizontal problem. Being able to solve this at every level makes it pretty quick, makes it pretty easy. And if you were going to go solve this over emails, then, well, I've got one email here, one email here, this person wasn't, CC-ed, this person with left off, this person, whatever. And aggregate pain felt by all of these people, my favorite thing about Passthrough is I've never had to convince people that sub-docs are terrible. Everybody thinks that they're horrible. Cool, great. We make it pretty easy and it looks like it's simple, it should look like it's simple. There's a lot of stuff that's complex behind it shouldn't feel like that. And so create that experience and that puts the network to work.",1492
222,Tim Flannery - Simplifying Fund Closing,Solving Unsexy Problems Through Process," Patrick: I happen to just think that the best possible thing is like you said, something that is universally regarded, that's terrible, but somehow persist, so Sub-docs being a great example, what a great problem to go work on? It's not exactly landing a rocket ship on Mars in terms of the sexiness of the problem, maybe to someone that hasn't encountered it before. And I don't mean that in a negative way at all. What has then in that situation given the specificity of the problem that you're solving, been your secret or key to recruiting a team very quickly, which is something we've been able to see you guys do? To what do you attribute that success of high close rate, high, whatever you want to measure with, of building a talented team pretty quickly around a problem like this? Tim: I love unsexy businesses and it's tough to get unsexier than sub-docs. I don't have anybody dropping out of Stanford to try to solve this, so this is fantastic. There's a couple things. Part one is you got to run a good process, it doesn't matter if you're three people like when we started or 25 people, which we're about to be shortly or hopefully much bigger than that, you have to run a process that respects the time of the individuals that you're talking to and also allows your team to learn about them. And so there's all sorts of ways that you can choose to evaluate people, you can obviously evaluate their previous work product, you can evaluate how they line up with your values. You can evaluate their interest in the company and you could do practical things to just make sure that you're bringing in a quality talent. Great. But people can tell when you're running an efficient or inefficient process, it doesn't matter if it's in recruiting or if it's in sales or if it's in operations, it's very obvious to people when there's something of substance behind it. So the first thing is that we ran a process that I'd be proud to run at a 1,000 person company, just as I'm proud to run it at a 20-person company. Patrick: What are the aspects of that process? Break that down for us. Tim: First part of it is that you need to make sure you're not asking overlapping questions. There's nothing that people hate more of like, tell me about a time when you experienced a failure, and the next person says, tell me about a time when you experienced a failure. You're not learning anything new, somebody's just repeating the same story, all you're just doing is wasting time. Part of it is setting expectations. We have on all of our job descriptions, ""Here's exactly the process that we go through for every candidate."" First of all, because it's equitable. So we need to run all the candidates through it so that we're getting a proper evaluation of everybody because everybody is the same set of things that we've taken a look at. But what that also does is it communicates it. I'm not in the dark as a candidate about what I'm going out and doing. I know, well, first I've got a screen, then I've got a case study, then I've got an onsite. And at the onsite, it's going to be a mix of behavioral questions, it's going to be questions about my knowledge in the private markets. And then at the end of the day, I'm going to find out a week later, is this the right place for me?So they know exactly what's going on, there's no confusion, you can move forward. Other elements of it is being thoughtful about the types of information that you're collecting. We believe pretty strongly that we want to make sure that when we're bringing people on, they do line up with our values. That's a big part of the evaluation process. We want to understand their work history, especially if it's relevant. We want to understand that they've actually done their homework into Passthrough and into the private markets. And so we'll hold you into a different standard, if it's your first time ever looking at the private markets, as opposed to you've been in the space for 20 years, of course we'll have different standards for people, but we want to see that there's interest actually in what we're doing instead of somebody who's just coming in. We'll also try to do something that's practical. And so there's different things that you can do with practical. We have a written case study for one role, we've got a live case study for another one. We have a show me your portfolio for designer positions. There's a bunch of different ways that we can evaluate it, but try to understand in that context, how can you actually see something tangible from this person and use the that to say, ""All right, they get it,"" but they don't get it.And that's a proper screen as well. We also are really thoughtful about using our investors. So we bring in Sam Kates who sits on our board and Sam talks to a number of our candidates and that helps them get a different context. There's the view of what we have as the operators of the business, but there's the view that Sam has sitting on our board. And so, ""Hey, you are important, we do want you here. Here's how you should think about it."" And so when we see somebody we like, we throw the kitchen sink at it. We're going to go win that business. And our hit rate from when we've actually made an offer, I think we had two candidates reject offers. Both of them asked for something that we thought was unfair given the role, and so it was a disagreement about comp. It had nothing to do with whether or not this was the right opportunity and they selected something else. Patrick: This example, the sales example, you personally are extremely interested in process and pipelines and the intersection of those two things and efficiency. Where did that come from for you? Was that the personality thing? Is it based on formative experiences in other businesses? Why that common theme? Tim: I started my career at JP Morgan in an operations role. I actually started off just by wiring money between institutional investors and funds, so not the most glamorous of- Patrick: Found something less sexy than sub-docs? Tim: Yeah. Treasury operations is right there. And so I started off by doing this and just taking a look at broken processes and tweaking them and getting better, and then went from that into an accounting context and then to a trading context. And so everything was operations, a little bit of work on strategy. Then I left and raised a micro VC fund with a couple of other people, and that turned into a strategy and investing conversation. And I decided to go business school after that. And when I graduated from business school, I took a sales job. And so my background exclusively before this had been operations and in strategy, I thought sales would be helpful if one day I was going to go run a business. I'm glad I made that choice. But my approach to sales then was, there's got to be some repeatable process here. There's something that I can do time after time to evaluate if this candidate's a good fit, to just be able to judge if I had a good call, shouldn't just be this gut feel. I should go into a call and I should know, what does success look like? Success might look like, ""Well, this is a qualified lead,"" or they ask for a demo, or we're negotiating a contract. And so if you start to break things down into their component parts, you can really quickly understand what's working and what isn't working and you can experiment and get better and better, and better.Whether I'm going out and selling or whether I'm going out and helping to go build an operations process or whatever, it all comes down to process. So there's all sorts of different outcomes that can happen and those outcomes can be totally random, but we think that if we actually tweak the processes and we start to understand where we can get more efficient, where we can learn more information, where we can provide a better experience, the outcomes are going to tilt in our favor a little bit more. We do it across everything at Passthrough, recruiting, sales, ops, it's all process driven. So we always look for an opportunity. We love when we make mistakes. We took a lot from Google's postmortem culture, if you haven't read Google's postmortem culture blog, I'd really recommend doing it. For every time we make a mistake, it's an opportunity to get better. Let's not rely upon heroism from somebody, let's figure out how we can improve a process. Patrick: Can you say a little bit about process design from a cold start? So if you're approaching some new thing, you have to build a process for in the business. What is the process for process design? What is the thing that you do over and over again to get one of these things going? Tim: It's like writing an essay. There's lots of people who, if they're going to go write an essay, they're just going to go write. And they're going to go say, ""Well, I've got all these ideas and I want to go put them all together."" But the most effective writers that I know, my favorite writers, what they do is a lot of planning. And so they say, ""Well, here are the certain things that I want to make sure that I'm capturing. I want to make sure that I'm saying like, here's my main idea one, how it goes to my main idea number two, how it gets to main idea number three, and then I'm going to wrap it all up into conclusion."" Most things look like this when you're dealing with customers, ""Here's what I'm going to tell you, I'm going to tell, and here's what I told you."" And so it's the same idea across pretty much all these processes, just be thoughtful about what it is that your goals are. And then what you can do when you are running a process is you can really quickly experiment. Well, I thought my goal was going to be this, I thought that we were only having in a sales context, a discovery call, but actually, it's probably a discovery call and a demo. Well, you know what, maybe it discovery call, a demo, and I'm going to give you a price.Actually, maybe I can actually get a signed contract out of one meeting. And so you start with assumption, and you just systematically work through, until eventually, you arrive at something that looks like an optimal process. We truly believe that there is often an optimal process, an optimal way to go do things. And so what we'll say to people is, ""Hey, here's the way that we think the world works."" This isn't to say we're going to go turn you into a robot, we have no interest in turning people into robots, but we think that this is the best starting point. And then take this and make it your own, tweak things, be thoughtful about it. And so it lets us train people so much quicker. It lets us collect the feedback that we need. It lets us just be more thoughtful about how we're managing the business, how we're managing the process, how we're tracking, whether or not we're successful, because every time we're going into something, we say, ""Well, what's the measure for success here? And have we hit it?""",2520
223,Tim Flannery - Simplifying Fund Closing,Thoughtful Pricing and Other Lessons for Builders," Patrick: Can you say a little bit about pricing? I feel irresponsible if I go through a software company discussion and don't ask how they came to their price and their pricing model on their business model, because it's just like in the world of high-gross margins, there's almost too much choice. There's a million ways you could price this, who you could charge, when you could charge them. What have you learned about thoughtful pricing in software? Tim: When you're a software business, what you try to do is you look for recurring revenue, but if your business model and your pricing model doesn't match what the customer's doing in practice, then you've got something that's broken. One of the earliest decisions that we had to make was, ""All right, well, I'm a fund manager. I might go out and raise every five years, every three years, I might raise 20 times a year. And so what does it actually look like for us to price some fun closing software?"" If we tried to force a subscription model down somebody's throat that was raising every three years, that's not going to be very effective. We need to actually match what it is that they're doing. Now, there's some argument to be made, maybe you should go out and build something that's recurring in nature, maybe, but I think the thing that we got to solve is fun closing first. So our pricing isn't necessarily a subscription. We may take a look at the subscription when we do one of my favorite things, which is bundling. So you're constantly in the market, you have expectations of what you're doing from year A to year B. You have all of these other different things that could happen. And so you're a very active fund manager, let's bundle some stuff together. I get the advantage of collecting more revenue upfront, you get the advantage of, I can have some efficiencies and that lets me get a little bit more flexible on price than I would otherwise. You actually did an episode on bundling a year or two ago, it's great episode, but bundling is incredibly powerful. It changed the way that we sold Carta.It changes the way that we talk to our customers today, and it matches up across a ton of different context. And we're constantly experimenting with pricing too. So when we first started, we said, ""Well, let's just do it based on the number of investors. It's the discreet activity that happens."" You have a certain number of investors that run through your fund, but it might not be predictable and you might not know what's going on. Another one was, well, we could just do it based on the number of closes. Well, what if it's a rolling close or what if it's everything else? And so eventually the way that we got to pricing, or at least our current iteration of it, and we continue to experiment and will continue to, is we just think about it, ""All right, there's a maximum price that fund closing is worth, and that price is not based on the cost of it. It's not cost plus pricing. It's not competitor pricing. It's what we think the value is. It's willingness to pay. And so we think the maximum willingness to pay for this is X. And so that's what it looks like if you're a large global asset manager. And if you're smaller and that might be a number of LPs, it might be a number of size of the fund, then we discount it, that's it. And so we try to match it to where you can afford it, but we understand what the value is that we're bringing and that's how we price it today. Patrick: What major aspects of what you've learned so far building Passthrough have we not talked about yet that you think are generalizable for other builders out there? Tim: This is my first time being a founder. I sat down with another founder, he'd had a successful exit. He was working in an investment bank, he was now running this giant business there. And we started off with the three of us, and we were doing customer operations, we were doing support for investors, we were onboarding funds, we were building a product. We were doing all of it, just the three of us. When you're getting going, you're the super individual contributor, you're going out and your hands are in absolutely everything and you're really good at it. That's why the business takes off is because you're really, really good at, it feels really good, it's emotionally rewarding, but he said, ""Well, you're going out, you're about to hire your first couple of employees."" My favorite transition was when I went from being the super contributor to, there's actually what I need to do is get my team up to speed because it's not a good use of my time if I'm going out and doing this thing and even though it's really rewarding, Ben periodically loves going out and helping onboard a fund. That's not the best use of his time at all, but you start to ship your context from not what's the thing that I need to solve this moment and what's the thing that is due today to all right, well, what does a successful week look like?What's a successful month look like? What should we be doing over the next quarter over the next year? It's not purely a budgeting exercise, it's how you step back and think about the strategy of the business. Maybe the most rewarding thing for me has been figuring out, one, how I can mentor and coach my team so that they can handle all this day to day and they can have this growth in their careers, and they can do all these other things. We always make sure that Passthrough is good for them and they're good for Passthrough, and the math always needs to work out. And so a lot of it's on career management, career management, it's just fun stuff. But then the second part is my point of view on the business is totally different than at any point in my career, whether or not I was leading go-to market for car investor services, or I was an investor, I just have a different horizon than I'm used to. And so that transition from, well, I need to make sure this fund gets out by tomorrow, to how do I think about what we're doing over the next three to five year years has been really rewarding. Patrick: Having personally built a lot in the investor technology space, we were instantly attracted to what you're building. I love the lessons around identity and network-based distribution and product and something that's universally despised, and all these things are just really fun touch points, lessons that I've learned over the last five years about interesting software businesses. So it's so fun to explore this with you today, Tim. I ask everybody the same traditional closing question. What is the kindest thing that anyone's ever done for you? Tim: Even though I look very, very similar to my mother and my father, my brother, I'm adopted. And so the kindest thing that ever happened was that my birth mother made that difficult choice to give me up for adoption. And so I got to go grow up with a family in suburban Pennsylvania, just be surrounded by people who were loving and able and that supportive, just that attitude and the amount of love that I was able to get on a daily basis set me up to just thrive and set who I am as a person today. Patrick: That's a wonderful answer. Can you say just a bit more about what it was like to grow up adopted when you learned of it or just what the experience was? Because I think you're the third person to have an answer like this, and it's just one of these incredibly elemental things that's really powerful. If you're willing, I would love to just hear a little bit more about the felt experience of it. Tim: Yeah. My parents never hid for me that I was adopted. From the moment I could talk, I would walk up to people and say, ""Hi, my name's Tim and I'm adopted."" I'm sure that was a little awkward, but it was just something that was fact, it wasn't this stigma, it wasn't this anything else. It was just, ""All right, I've got blonde hair and blue eyes and I'm adopted."" It was just a fact about me, there was nothing that was too crazy about it. And so because of that, it was just this really, really normal thing, there was nothing traumatic about it, there was nothing, whatever. It was just a fact to life. And I was never, ever made to feel anything other than a loved member of my family. Patrick: What made your parents decide to adopt? Tim: My parents had trouble having a second child. I was the second one that they tried to adopt. And then the first one actually got taken back. So my brother's 10 years older than me. And they had like a seven-year struggle trying to have a second child and going through the adoption agencies and then a year or two before me, they did adopt someone and then they weren't able to keep them and then it turned out, we were a good match. Patrick: You referenced it as a fact of life and also as a huge act of kindness. Do you think that it affects how you operate and what drives you on an ongoing basis? Tim: I don't know. What probably affects me on an ongoing basis is my genetic predisposition for ADD. And so the fact that I cannot sit still, rarely satisfied with intermediate outcome and just have this constant, constant motion. And so there's your little bit of nature versus nurture. Patrick: I appreciate the couple extra levels of the final question, a beautiful answer, a beautiful scenario. Really glad to hear it, didn't note about you. Tim, thanks so much for that answer and for all your time today. Tim: Thanks for having me.This site uses cookies to improve your browsing experience.

224,Joey Levin - Building an Anti-Conglomerate,Introduction," Patrick: My guest today is IAC CEO, Joey Levin. IAC is a unique business in that it's a holding company which builds world class digital businesses. Since Barry Diller created IAC, it has produced 11 public companies, including Match Group, Expedia and Live Nation. Today, the business is comprised of category leaders, like Angi, Dotdash, Meredith and care.com. Joey joined IAC in 2003 and became CEO in 2015. We talk about why he tries to avoid centralization between businesses, what he's learned from Barry Diller, how he approaches capital allocation and so much more. This conversation serves as an excellent reminder that there is no one formula to company building. Everything is idiosyncratic and requires its own best decisions. Please enjoy this great discussion with Joey Levin.",173
225,Joey Levin - Building an Anti-Conglomerate,Understanding IAC," Patrick: So Joey, I think this conversation has to begin with a high level description of the unique nature of IAC. It's this anti-conglomerate conglomerate. Those familiar with it tend to be obsessed with the model and really into it. But for those that aren't, I think a neat opening question would be, how you think about the operating system of the business itself? It's quite distinctive and unique. How would you describe the OS of IAC to a professional investor that isn't familiar with the business yet? Joey: We are in the business of building businesses, and everything that's part of IAC supports that. And there are others. Every business is in the business of building their business, and some are in the business of building multiple businesses. The best ones that have to be in the business of building multiple businesses. Two things that are pretty unique about IAC is, number one, our time horizon, and number two, the reality that we don't try to keep all of our businesses under one umbrella. We take our best and most successful businesses, and instead of saying, what many do, which is let's hold onto that business. We say, okay, it's ready, and we give it to our shareholders. Which doesn't mean we get rid of it, we give it to our shareholders through a spinoff. And then those shareholders get to own it directly, and be a part of that business directly, and continue or not on their own directly.And those two differences together are pretty unique in our operating model. Investing on a forever timeline is a very different structure than a lot of capital is organized. Most capital is organized with a finite thing. You go in, in this period, and you come out in period. And with those incentives, people are organized to do things. What do you do in the in period? And what do you do in the out period? For us, there is no out period. Even when we're spinning something off, it's not like we say, okay, well, we got rid of it at just the right point to get rid of it. We're only giving it to ourselves. It has to be doing well and it has to be doing well forever. So organizing on that timeline is unique. And then the ability to say, with the leaders of our businesses, you can grow up here in this house and hopefully learn a lot and grow up well in this house. And then at some point, you probably get too big for the house and you want out of the house, and maybe we want you out of the house. And that's okay too, and you can have a thriving life outside of the house, as families do, as teenagers do, et cetera. It's a very natural thing. Patrick: What was the first thing spun out and did the philosophy around spin outs itself grow out of that incident bottom up? Or was it more of a top down thing? I'm just curious how you came to this philosophy of spinning out the mature assets. Joey: All things for us, pretty much, have been bottom up. Expedia was the first. And when we spun Expedia, it was the right decision for Expedia at that time. But there was not a decision, which is, let's start doing this as a model. In fact, it probably wasn't until after we had done several that we said, this is a model and this makes sense, and this is something for us to continue to do. We try stuff and when we say we're opportunistic. We say we're always willing to try something new. We're not wed to one sector, category, business stage, whatever, and we're also not wed to a structural thing. But then when we saw this working, we said this makes sense. This is the right thing to do. It's not just learning from what we did. It's also learning from what others did or didn't do, and seeing what's happened there. Meaning that you see businesses stay under the umbrella for too long, and they start to no longer be optimized for their own success. They optimize for other things and then atrophy in that context. Patrick: What are the biggest differences in how the home office itself looks as a result of this philosophy relative to, let's say, some other holding company that's maybe the most similar, but keeps the operating assets under a single umbrella. How does the difference manifest in the way that IAC, the company, and the home office looks? Joey: People a lot of times ask us, it's a related question about synergies, or what's centralized, or things like that. And I think that when you say the businesses are staying in this one umbrella forever, then you do seek more synergies. And some people view that as a good thing, and there's some people have succeeded very well with making that a good thing. Which is, well, we always have accounting, or we always have, pick a function, where we're very good at that. That's centralized and then things can grow off of it. Because we know that things tend to come in and out, now that does happen over a very long period of time, but things do tend to come in and out. We don't centralize very much, and we don't do that for the reason I just said, but we also don't do it because that's usually not the right way to optimize the business. Meaning the cost side, and we're vigilant on the cost side, but the cost side of a business, by definition, is finite. Each business that has it knows that's finite. The revenue side is infinite for all those businesses. And so, if you said we're going to take away this control, or this flexibility, or we're going to centralize this marketing, or sales, or technology, or whatever it is. You remove some level of accountability from the leader of that business. And you remove some flexibility of the leader of that business.When we can save on an accountant or a centralized function, we like to. But I would much rather be a little bit inefficient there for the ability of the business and the business leader to have absolute accountability, and be able to go for the biggest upside in their business. So those things go well together, meaning we can't centralize because, at some point, we un-centralize, but also we philosophically don't really believe in optimizing the centralization as much as we believe in optimizing the business where it's cleanest, and clearest, and most accountable path forward. And we also aren't structured for accountability in ways that maybe other organizations are less so. To compare it, a business within IAC compared to, say, a public company with a public board, or even a private company with a private board made up of investors and whatever. Our ability to execute change and hold accountability is much, much swifter than those other alternatives. I've been part of those alternatives, public companies, controlled public companies, uncontrolled public companies, private companies, all that. There's a level of group think. There's a level of politeness. There's a level of things that just, by virtue of being a group, move much slower. Because of the way we're organized, we can drive accountability much sharper and much swifter. And I think that also works very well in that structure. Patrick: Agility is such an interesting concept for a business like yours. And I think if you were to add a third really important attribute on top of the first two you highlighted, it's your history of respecting the change, the internet, and digital represents for just core functions. Most of the businesses that people will be familiar with that came through or out of IAC are things that people have done forever, but just brought into the digital world. Maybe say a little bit about just that as a piece of the IAC story. Maybe starting with Barry's realization that this was something powerful. Put some flesh around that concept, because it seems to be a defining characteristic of the story itself. Joey: Barry, philosophically, and IAC as a result, has always embraced change. Think about Barry in his career and how many different categories he's been a leader or part of a leader in, it's exceptional. Most people get very good at one thing, and are exceptional at one thing, and then move on to retirement, or philanthropy, or something else, and he is done multiple industries. And that is an important part of what we do, embracing change, and also that intellectual curiosity. So embracing change can mean a lot of things. It can mean, for example, challenging your own businesses, competing with yourself. That's something that we've done multiple times. We believe in a category, we have a bet in a category of business that we're backing, and we might also back a direct competitor to that, because we know the category's going to work. We don't know whether we've got the product right. We don't know whether we've got the team right. Or we just want more exposure to what we think is an obvious future, and we'll do that, and we'll challenge ourselves. Or we've been in something for a while and there's something that can disrupt it. We'd rather, of course, disrupt ourselves, then have somebody else disrupt us, and that's also central to the philosophy. Another piece, I'd say, is, I alluded to this a minute ago, but I talked sometime about where are we going with our capital? And you alluded to this too a minute ago.It's where the future is obvious. It's not so much seeing around corners. When you see something it's saying is travel going to happen this way in the future, or is travel going to happen where people can access an online travel agency and have access to all the data? Are they going to use travel agents in the way they're using travel agents? Or if they have all the data in the world, and they have it at their fingertips, and they can make the decisions for themselves, what are they going to do? That future is definitely obvious. Is it Expedia that's going to win, or hotels.com that's going to win, or Hotwire? Well, we ended up with all three of those, but the point is definitely where the future was going was clear. And where we find those things, we just like to make sure we have enough exposure to that, and enough angles on it, that we can participate in that change and help affect some of that change. There is probably a time where people might have been doubtful of travel. But I think if you look at these things, when you see what the new product looks like relative to the incumbent product, you know that the new product is going to be meaningful. You just don't know who's going to do deliver the winning new product. Patrick: How much of it can be simplified down to faster, larger choice digital experiences? Is that the... If I had to boil it down, maybe oversimplify it. Do you think that's the fair oversimplification of the secret sauce of what's made so many of these things successful? Joey: I think that was one phase. Actually, the current phase is the exact opposite of that. Meaning, if you could take Google as the example, or Amazon and how amazing those businesses are and continue to be, but also where they're vulnerable. You would remember the first time you used Google and you searched for something trivial and it was three billion results for this. And I was like, holy cow, there's three billion results for this thing. You rarely got past the first page, which is the first 10 links, but nonetheless, there's a billion results for this thing. The platforms today, and especially with different interfaces with platforms, like voice, a billion results is obviously useless. It speaks to the power of the platform, but it's obviously practically useless for the end user. And even 20 results to the second page, or even 10 results to the first page, or even three results is not that helpful, if you actually can technologically say and expect just give me the one that works. If I can trust you to be fair priced, to be reliable, to be ethically consistent with the things that I believe in, just give me the one, and that's a better solution for me. Then I don't have to look at 10 and I don't have to figure out which one's better. If you know my preferences, and you know how I think about it, and I could trust this branding, just give me the one. And that's a better solution. You could think about it for our businesses. Angie is probably one of the best examples of that, and the evolution of how that category went. That category started as Yellow Pages, which just had a list of everything, but no information. And then there was a great innovation, which was Angie's List, which was a list of everybody with grades and with reviews, as you could sort through that list much better.And then Home Advisor came along. We own Angie's List and Home Advisor. Home Advisor came along and said, well, we're going to match you with up to three. So you give us the information, you need the house, or you need the roof. It's this kind of shingles, and that you need it on this date, whenever. You give us the information, we'll give you three people who can definitely do that job when you want the job done in the timeframe you want the job done, they're available. Where we are now with the product, and we've combined Home Advisor and Angie's List into a brand now called Angie. And what is now the fastest growing solution is one where somebody says, here's what's wrong with my house. And we say, okay, it costs $250 to fix that. They say, okay, here's the credit card, and you've figured out from there. And that, so far, the highest customer satisfaction product we've ever seen in the category by an order of magnitude. You realize that some homeowners want to negotiate, want to make sure they've looked somebody in the eyes or whatever, but many say, if you're going to stand behind this, and you're going to make sure it gets done, then you just get it done for me and find the one person. And I alluded to it a minute ago, but some of the UI now demands that on voice. Say, I want this, the voice can't say, well, here's 10 possible responses to this. The voice says, here's the answer. I think that'll be increasingly true of the way user interfaces work.",3156
226,Joey Levin - Building an Anti-Conglomerate,The Best Winners and Lessons From IAC's History," Patrick: So maybe technology and digital and internet is the wrong way to think about this, and really the right way is convenience. Technology enables the next layer of more convenient. And when you say obvious, the thing that's the arbiter of what's obvious is, is it more convenient for the customer? Is that maybe the right summation instead of technology focused? With that in mind, I'm curious then, how you think about the shared characteristics of the incubations and the investments that have worked versus those that haven't. Obviously, there's always lessons to learn from winning and from not winning. How would you categorize some of those concepts? Is there a through-line to the situations that have worked really well versus those that haven't across IAC's history, since you have a pretty decent sample size? Joey: It is so hard. I think about this question all the time. And every time I think I've got the alchemy, now I've got a perfect example for why that didn't work. A lot of people say back the best teams. Of course, we want to back the best teams. Of course, we want to back ambitious people. Of course, talent is amazing, but we have some of our most successful businesses of all time where the very early talent spark was unequivocally the wrong talent for the next phase, or some of the later growth phases in there. Then we have examples of the opposite of that. Again, not at all to discount out the importance of talent, but there's different talent at different phases, and it's not one thing that says the biggest winners are when we found some amazing human so early in their lives. But, of course, we do have examples of that. One for sure is large addressable markets. What are you going for? If you're going for something very small, then you can succeed, and then you'll be very small. So what are big addressable markets and how do you have big ambitious vision? That's an important one. But again, I could actually come up with exceptions to that, which is you start going after something very, very small and you are so good.Probably, Shopify is a great example of that. When Tobi built Shopify he was building something for his snowboard shop and did a great job with that. And I don't think he thought he was going to take over the world of e-commerce then, but he was so good at that and such an exceptional person, and he got so good at so many things that they built that. So it's very, very hard to come up with a rule. I guess probably the most important, which is maybe consistent with that point is, the ability to change. The ability to keep adapting. The ability to keep looking bigger, looking for bigger opportunities, and the ability to keep changing with the market, as necessary, or changing with the product, as necessary. Change is also tactical things like when do you start monetization? There are times to do it. There are times not to do it. There are times that it's absolutely essential, because you have to control your own destiny to be able to continue to innovate. It's very, very hard to say what is the same. The only thing that's the same is change. Patrick: Maybe to zoom in on, to bring some of these ideas to life, to zoom in on Match, or something like that. You also said earlier, sometimes you'll compete with yourself, and there've been a lot of different situations where with Tinder, with Match, with other assets, you've been in the same theme multiple times at different points, or rolled them together. Obviously, that's another example; people are going to date, that's a highly addressable market. Maybe walk through the lessons learned from that segment, specifically. What did it feel like to have a competitive product at the same time? How did you differentiate between the sub-markets, if you will, in the online dating world, how does that stand out in memory? Joey: There are a ton of great lessons in that one. Going back to the future, is obvious, but not just that people will date, which of course they will. But also, more importantly, was the way that you found people was happenstance, or being set up by somebody. Or, if you wanted to, there was a thing called personals ads that was a big market. People won't even imagine that this would possibly be true. You'd put a little blurb of text in the back of a newspaper to meet somebody. That was a very large category of advertising dollars in newspapers and magazines. So we said, okay, there's this static thing that doesn't do any matching, or you can have a dynamic thing that does do matching, and puts people together. That was the first turn of that, and it involved a lot. I do remember talking about mobile at Match, and how hard it was for Match Group, which is a parent company which spun off of IAC. Within Match Group there are multiple brands; there's the original brand, which is still a successful brand called Match.com. Then, as you say, there's Tinder, and OkCupid, and Hinge, and a bunch of international brands. Many others. What I remember talking about at the time, was how hard mobile was; how hard it was for Match.com now to make the transition to mobile, and how there were some fundamental flaws in that.For example, going into the app store was a big challenge for Match.com, because for Match to go into the app store was to give up 30% of revenue to Apple, or to Android at the time. There was, for good reason, a lot of resistance to that. Then came Tinder who never knew you could have that other 30% of revenue essentially, and so could play in building that up and here came Tinder, built mobile native, and never even built a desktop product. That became so much more easily, and so much more naturally there. I think that it's very hard for an institution to change itself dramatically. It is definitely easier to take the learnings that you have from the one product, and then apply it to something that builds a native in whatever the new medium is, or the new platform is. Those things were totally separate. In fact, Tinder was built in an incubator in IAC, not even an incubator in Match. The goal of the incubator, and I was to build multiple businesses in mobile, and one of them happened to be this, and then eventually it moved into Match, which made sense. Building it outside of there was really helpful to it's early success. Patrick: You mentioned the only constant being change. The world of digital and internet has changed so much in the period that you've been operating, and incubating, investing in these businesses. One of the biggest ones is customer acquisition costs; has been a big, big topic in the last two years. Just taking that as one example of a really important systemic change, how have you navigated something like that? How does that impact the way you think about the existing businesses; the candidates for the next incubation, or investment, using that as an episode to drive home, okay, change is constant. Here's a change. How do we deal with it? Joey: Not that long ago, there was a prevailing wisdom, and maybe it still is in some ways, that actually customer acquisition is something that only bad businesses spend money on. If your product is good enough, then you don't need any customer acquisition costs. That was a thing in silicon valley for a time period. I never believed that. I thought absolutely a better product is necessary, and the better the product gets, the easier it is to distribute, and the more viral it is, and all of those things. Actually, if you can have this wonderful product, and then you can accelerate it meaningfully with customer acquisition, that's an even better thing, because you have some tools in your control to add more fuel to the fire. We've always believed that's a really important thing. I think now, every pitch deck you see on every company is LTV to CAC, Lifetime Value to Customer Acquisition Costs, and all kinds of charges around Customer Acquisition Costs. For us, staying ahead on Customer Acquisition Costs is a huge portion of, if you aggregated ISC's P&L, huge dollars spent; a billion dollars spent.We're in a world where a lot of dollars are concentrated in a few platforms, making sure that you are ahead of the game on those platforms; understanding how those platforms work, and understanding how to navigate those platforms. Then, being early on the new platforms to understand those, to make sure that you're staying ahead of the game there. Of course, everything is product first, and there are a lot of creative things you can do around brand; important stories you can tell to differentiate around brand. That's really important. The tactical block and tackling of making sure you know how to work in those platforms, and optimize those platforms, where many, many users spend substantial portions of their day, or begin their day, or begin their inquiry, or whatever. That is a very, very critical skill to every major successful business. Patrick: What does ""great"" look like there? Obviously, there's rigor, there's experimentation, there are obvious things, but what separates the elite people at being good at customer acquisition in your experience, from the very good or the good? Joey: There are two approaches to it, and we don't always get to the more successful approach, which I'll explain. There are two approaches to it. One is you do what you said, which is a lot of experimentation. You say, okay, we're going to try and market here, and we're going to push the limit of what's possible. How do we get to profitable marketing, et cetera. We're going to go, go, go until we hit the wall. Then we're going to say, okay, that doesn't work. Let's push our dollars elsewhere. That's a totally reasonable, financially sensible, approach; but the best have a very different approach. What they say is, this channel needs to make sense for us as an acquisition, and we've pushed and pushed and pushed, and we can't get to profitability here. Well, what do we change about the product? Or what do we change about our supply dynamics, or whatever, to make it so it works?Think about it in the context of Angie, where we continue to get better every day, but we've gone up and down in our skills here. You say plumbers in Indianapolis, okay. We're trying to market to people who need plumbers in Indianapolis, and we can't do that profitably. Well, forget that. Let's do roofers in Indianapolis and figure out how to do that. Okay. Roofers in Indianapolis works really well. Let's focus on roofers in Indianapolis. The alternative is to say plumbers in Indianapolis, we can't get that working well. We only have 25 plumbers on the platform in Indianapolis. We need 50. You go to Sales and say, we need 50 plumbers in Indianapolis. That doesn't work. Okay, we need a hundred. That doesn't work. Okay, we need 200. How many do we need until we do it? The one thing we know we need is... It can't be possible that we can't reach customers profitably who are looking for plumbers in Indianapolis. When you invert that, that is when it starts to really scale infinitely. Patrick: Maybe the way to interpret that is, the great ones aren't siloed in the marketing function. They're willing to bleed into product, into sales, into other parts of the organization to solve the problem. Joey: Absolutely. Yes. One is, get a hundred more plumbers. The other is, change this page. This page doesn't convert well. That didn't work? Change it again. Okay, that didn't work? Change it again and keep going because we're not stopping to be successful on this particular area, in this particular thing. Patrick: How do you get people to do that? That seems like organizations tend to silo. The Facebook ad is like one point of a whole big chain that goes all the way deep back into product. How do you foster that kind of mentality in the business? Joey: Different people have taken different approaches. We spun off Expedia in 2004, or 2005, '04 or '05, I'm suddenly forgetting. I joined IAC in 2003, and I was a pipsqueak because I was not involved in much of that. Booking.com was probably the most successful scaling search marketing business, maybe ever. There are others that are close, but that could be the top. They always, as I understood it... Again, I'm never part of the organization, but as they did it, they divided into tiny teams, three-person teams, to go after this, where everyone was optimizing for the same thing, conversion. Everyone knew that whatever you were doing, you had to optimize for conversion. They did reset the whole organization to do that. That is a very hard thing to pull off. If you're built from the ground up that way, that works. I think it's very hard to transition an organization to something like that; split the whole organization into little parts, but you can move accountability. So yes, is marketing just receiving inputs and then doing the best they can? Or, is marketing creating inputs and reversing that? You can organizationally change that direction. Patrick: I love the concept, and I love the idea of pipsqueak early on. What most explains the move from pipsqueak to CEO for you, presumably you were part of a class of pipsqueaks, and here we are today. What do you attribute that to? Why do you think that happened? Joey: Probably a lot of things; luck being a big one. I really believe this, I always tried to speak my mind clearly and candidly, and think about what is best for the business. What is long-term best for the business? People talk about trying to act like an owner. I always felt like I was acting like an owner. That's the way I thought about it. I couldn't really think about it any other way. That makes a difference. I always had a point-of-view on where I thought we could go; what I thought we were doing right, or what I thought we were doing wrong. I always was willing to push on that point of view. Again, I wasn't always right on my point-of-view, but I did have one, which is how you make progress on things. Also, very early on, I always tried to be the most prepared person on something. If we were looking at a deal, I wanted to make sure I know as much as could be known about that company as anyone could possibly know; that I was prepared for whatever the question might be, or whatever the challenge might be, and be able to do that.The other thing I guess, is having an open mind and being able to communicate. I do this all the time. I just did this again yesterday on something, but I think some solution is the right answer to a problem, and I want to communicate that that solution is the answer to the problem, I write a note to the group about why I think that solution is the right answer. I'd say a significant portion of the time I sit down and I start to write that note to the group explaining why it's the right answer, and by the time I get to the end, I've reversed my position completely. As I put it down, I organize the thoughts, I don't think they're going here anymore, I go the opposite. Being capable of that, I do think is an important trait in helping an organization go forward.",3464
227,Joey Levin - Building an Anti-Conglomerate,How IAC Studies and Incubates Businesses," Patrick: I love the idea of knowing the thing in discussion better than anybody else. I'm really curious how that's continued today in terms of how you digest a new business. If you're seeing a new business for the first time, what is the process by which you get to know the critical aspects of that business? Joey: First of all, it's so far from true anymore, knowing more than anybody else. In everything I'm in, I know less than everybody. That's inevitable, but it is the reality. We look at so many businesses, our own successes, our own failures, our current successes, and our current failings. We look at so many businesses. In those, there are successes and failures in the sense of we saw something and we knew it, and we didn't act on it, or we saw something and we were wrong about the action we took on it, and the business went on to succeed, or the business went on to fail, et cetera. You do see patterns in people, you see patterns in metrics, and you definitely do learn from those patterns. One pattern in people is there are businesses, or business leaders or entrepreneurs, or whatever, who say from the get go, here's what we're going to do. Here's how we're going to exit. By the way, this company's at that amazing multiple, and we're going to multiply that multiple times this thing, and if we succeed, then we have that.That usually is a bad sign, because they're coming in with a plan to get out. For our investment horizon, we're coming in with a plan to take over the world with this business and this product. There is a difference, between the best businesses that are built with one mentality, and the other ones that... People make money on it, it's a successful strategy, I don't want to say it's not. There are tons of businesses, I'm sure, who have said, we're going to go in and we're going to get out, and then they've actually done that. For us to build category changing businesses, requires one personality, and not the other. It's the one who says, I love this. I believe in this. I want to build this, and I want to build this forever. Sometimes that's not the binding statement. Sometimes their interests change, or something becomes less appealing, or something becomes more appealing. The reality is things change all the time, but there is a difference in how you build, and how you think about your approach if you say, I think this can go on forever, versus how do I exit it and start planning for the exit before you even enter. Patrick: What are some other negative indications that perhaps the leader you have is no longer the appropriate leader, even if they were the appropriate leader for some stage of the business? Joey: There are all kinds of different signals, and we're always too late on making these changes. Patrick: Everyone is, it seems. Joey: Exactly. You talk to everybody, they say the same thing. Whenever you make a change, you wish you'd made it six months earlier, or two years earlier, or whatever. It is similar when some get overly obsessed with what's happening on the outside, as against what's happening on the inside, saying this business is doing that, or there's a lot of interest in people doing that other business, or whatever, so maybe we should do that, as against saying, how do we move what we have forward? I've seen this many times where that obsession moves from the internal to the external. It doesn't mean you shouldn't pay attention to the external. You have to pay attention to the external. The thing you have to be obsessed with, deeply obsessed with, is the internal. What are you doing for your customers? What are you doing for your category? What are you doing for your employees? How are you changing that? Where is your product failing? That obsession, and then, oh by the way, here's what's happening externally. You can't be blind to that, but you can't be obsessed with that. You've got to be obsessed with the internal. Patrick: When you think about a new category where you get interested, or you want to build something, or maybe buy something, we'll call it a vertical market, what characteristics are you generally looking for to begin with? You mentioned huge market as one obvious one, maybe something that doesn't change a lot over time, like dating. Are there other common characteristics that always need to be there for you to get interest in a vertical in the first place? I'm sure we'll talk about NewCo and crypto and some of this newer stuff as examples, but are there defining category characteristics that matter most to you? Joey: No, I don't think so, other than a good value catalyst usually is significant change underway, in that category, or significant change necessary. Although, I go certainly more towards underway, than necessary. You could have said in healthcare, significant change necessary, for a very, very long time, and still made no progress, because it's so hard to change. Patrick: If you think about opportunities for incubation, I love the idea of you're a factory that creates businesses. What are the stages at the earliest point of an incubation? How standard is the process of, okay, we've got an idea. Maybe then we get a team. Maybe then we do these five things. Walk me through the life cycle of something that's homegrown at IAC. Joey: We are now in our second iteration of an incubator. Our first incubator was called Hatch Labs, which was tremendously successful in that Tinder came out of Hatch Labs. It was the dumbest thing anyone's ever done, or the smartest thing anyone's ever done, which is we shut down Hatch Labs after Tinder. Tinder was a one in a million success. We said, okay, great. We went one for one, and let's avoid the next 999,000 failures. Or we said, we somehow cracked the code and changed the formula. We know how to make the one in a million successes one in six. No one will never know the answer to that question, but we shut it down, and it was shut down for a while, while we were focused on other things. We just recently, other than the last couple of years, built back the incubator and all the businesses coming out of the incubator now are so early stage that it's impossible to say whether we are succeeding or failing. We have a system now where companies can come from two places. One, Internal Ideas, which is in all IAC companies, or just the people who are focused on the incubator, called NewCo.Then, we go and try and find a ""founder,"" or a CEO, or a leader of that business. Then there's the alternative, which is somebody comes to us and says, ""I have an idea and I want to build it, and I could use your help building it."" We have engineers at NewCo who can build, who can build things quickly, and marketing people, and legal infrastructure, and other things like that, where we can test things and get things off the ground with relatively little capital. Then, if we have signs of momentum, then we can put more capital into it. Everything in there is iterative. And it's not yet clear that that's the right solution, just to be fair. Some people would say, ""Actually, the right thing to do is not be iterative. To give great people a pool of capital, or give lots of different groups of great people who pull the capital and just say, ""Figure it out,"" because their first five ideas are going to be wrong, or their first five approaches are going to be wrong, and then they're going to get lucky on the sixth and that'll be the one that works. And when you do it iteratively, for us, we say, ""Is there a sign of success here? No. Okay. Pull the capital and move it to something else."" You might need to give each little team or each little idea, more at bats to be successful.So we still don't know whether that's the right answer, but what we are doing is in each of these businesses that we're trying to start, we go out and build a little bit of product, and do a little bit of marketing to see what kind of engagement we get. And if the response on the marketing is above a certain threshold, and if the product resonates enough, which is evidence in the marketing, but it's also evidence in some of the UI and things like that, then we say, ""Okay, let's keep going. More capital, and then let's organize it for it to go off on its own."" That one can start with whether it's an internal idea or an external. We have one that we just, I think, announced yesterday. Or maybe we're about to announce, called Oar, which is in addiction medication. And the guy who founded that named Jonathan Hunt Glassman, he is a person who had an addiction issue, and that was solved with medicine. And he thinks not enough people have access to this medicine, are aware of this medicine, and not enough doctors prescribe this medicine. And also has a view towards creating digital therapeutics. So we just started experimenting in that. We started in one state, we built the product, we started shipping the product. We shipped it in ugly boxes with terrible packaging, with whatever, but just to see. And people appreciated it, and so now we've got beautiful boxes were starting to ship, in more states. And then we go from there. And that kind of pattern can exist in a bunch of different businesses at once, I think. Patrick: There's an interesting growing idea around if crypto and Web3 are going to be super successful, as concepts they're going to fade away. Consumers aren't talking about AWS when they're making a buying decision or something. The infrastructure behind enabling something cool and new disappears if it is really and enabling technology. How do you think about that in the context of NewCo? I know you've been experimenting and thinking about crypto and Web3, and making it fade away and really just enable some unique new consumer experience. Do you think that that's possible in the near term future? Seems to be what the system wants. Joey: It happens everywhere. Think about the other big phases of web and mobile. No one says anymore, ""Oh, is this a web product or is this a mobile product?"" It's just Tinder or it's Uber? It happens to exist on mobile or whatever. That's absolutely going to be true of Web3 and crypto. There's been a lot of debate, I'm sure you've participated in or watched on these things lately, of what is centralization, decentralization and how much of the espouse principles of Web3 are actually being truly adopted by the successful players of Web3? The big innovation that happened, and that will be an innovation for years and years, decades, at least a decade, is that a unique digital thing can exist. The fact that a unique digital thing can exist, one unique digital thing can exist, is really profoundly transformation. Everyone could one unique physical thing existing, but no one could ever imagine one unique digital thing existing. And now that one unique digital thing can exist, that will change lots of industries and open up new opportunities. Some obvious ones, I think, like ticketing, or fan clubs, or ways that a consumer interacts with a brand, they can do that in a unique digital way where they have a representative of one thing that they own with that brand. I think that concept of a unique digital item has enormous change potential. Patrick: How do you start to vector on where that could be deployed? In some sense, it seems to be such a big idea. Every business should spend a little bit of time. What if the demand curve was much more filled up because we can be so discriminatory up and down that curve with our product or service or whatever, and appeal to the super fan all the way down to the just barely fan, or whatever. How do you even approach, ""Okay, it's a big idea. Let's narrow it down to something tangible that we could put dollars behind and get excited about."" Joey: This is by far the hardest thing, and goes back to the Match analogy. We've asked all our businesses to think about it. One thing we do every year is we get top leaders of IAC businesses together once a year in someplace nice, and we hang out and do fun things. We go through annual plans, which is a bit of a grind, but the purposes get together and get to know each other. And at the end, we have always given a gift of some relevance to the participants. And usually the gift has timely relevance. A couple years ago, we gave everybody a Bitcoin and we said, ""Do something with this. Sell it, buy something with it, hold onto it. But now you have one, so you know what it is to play with it."" Bitcoin was three years ago or something like that. It was when Bitcoin went up to $15,000. I remember our CFO was very upset, rightfully so. Which is we gave it to everybody at $10,000, I think, and it turned out we were naked short Bitcoin because we hadn't bought them yet. So the liability just kept going up and we had no idea where it was going to stop. We eventually purchased it at 15 or something like that. This year we did NFTs, and so we try to get people to experiment. We want everybody think about it, because I do think it can transform a lot of businesses. But again, long-winded going back to the match analogy, I do think it's more likely, frankly, that there will be new things that we start, that compete with our businesses, that are more successful in experimenting with these things than it is likely that our existing businesses make a big transformation among your product to suddenly turn into a DAO or suddenly distribute an NFT that changes the trajectory of the business or something like that.",3087
228,Joey Levin - Building an Anti-Conglomerate,Finding the Right Approach to Capital Allocation," Patrick: What do the conversations between you and the other decision makers, senior leaders at the firm feel like around the topic of capital allocation? So if you look at IAC's outlay of capital, sometimes very large like the MGM, or Angie's list, or Meredith or something, and then sometimes you're starting something of new and buybacks are always an option in capital allocation IAC, the central stock moves around. How do you deliberate between the different options of how to allocate the company's capital? And what's the nature of those conversations. Joey: I grew up in IAC. I had one job briefly out of college before IAC for a year and a half. It's been my whole career, and so I take this for granted, but when people come into IAC for the first time, they're always surprised by the candor in our conversations, and relatedly the rigor in our conversations. Capital allocation is the most important thing that we do. And it is every week we are sitting down and talking about that. And that process always has everything on the table. And I think that is, I've come to realize, not firsthand, but secondhand. That that is, I guess, unique. But when we're looking at things to say, ""Well, we could do this or we could buy back stock. We could do this, or we could buy this other thing. We could do this, and which one makes the most sense over a long period of time? Which one is the most strategic value? Which one has the greatest use of a finite item on capital?"" And we have that discussion, and I think sometimes people don't believe that either. Questions I always get from shareholders are, for example, when are you going to spin off X? And sometimes they get angry with that question. Why haven't you spun off X yet? And they say, ""Well, we do think about it. We think about it all the time."" And they say, ""Well, you haven't spun off."" ""Well, we spun off another business. So we are willing to spin off businesses."" ""But you haven't spun off this one."" ""Yeah, we haven't spun off that one yet. But we do think about it.""And it's true. We go back all the time and we say, ""Everything's on the table."" There is no sacred item in here we say, ""Well, we can't possibly do that. We'll never do that."" It's on the table. And the opposite is on the table too. People will say to me now, ""Why haven't you spun off Angie? Or why haven't you bought in Angie?"" Angie's a publicly traded subsidiary of IAC. IAC owns 85%, the public owns 15%. At one point said publicly, we were thinking about spinning it, and then we decided not to. And we get these questions all the time. But when we think about our capital and capital allocation, we think, ""Okay, should we be spinning Angie? Or should we be buying Angie back in? Or should we be doing nothing?"" But all those things are on the table, and they do get regularly reviewed when we're thinking about the priorities for our capital. And that is an important component of how we do what we do. That we won't eliminate those options because they can come back and they can make sense. Patrick: And how much of that is quantitative versus qualitative analysis and insight? Is it a blend of the two? Is somebody there running models on one thing versus the other, versus just knowing this is a huge opportunity that we can't stick into a data set yet, but we know it's there? What's the blend of qualitative and quantitative in the capital allocation decision making process? Joey: Obviously a mix of both. And every conversation, most of the people around the table have a general sense of how the financials work. So we're not running a model every week on every alternative that we could do. That would be a big computer to do that. So we're not getting deep into the numbers until we've made, I'd say, the qualitative decision. Not to say the numbers aren't relevant, because they're in our heads and we're thinking about them for sure. But we're not running a model until we're pretty far along in the decision, or until we think we have a strategy that we think makes sense, and then we're looking at the numbers to verify and challenge and see whether that'll make sense or not. But in the end, you could say, this is true of acquisitions too. The way that we're thinking about acquisitions and businesses that we want to buy, we're rigorous on price, and we fight for the last dollar. But in the end, no deal we've ever done the successes on whether we've spent 10 or 20 or 30% more or less on the price. It's qualitatively, do we think this has a huge future? Are we right about this huge future? And if we are, then that difference in price isn't ultimately going to make the difference. And if we're wrong qualitatively on that, then we're wrong, and provided we haven't bet the company, that's also not going to make it a huge difference. Of course you'd rather have lost less money than more, but it doesn't feel much better to lose 270 million than it feels to lose 300 million dollars. Of course rather have 30 million more. Patrick: What idea, or even company or investment, felt the most right and exciting when the decision was made, that turned out to be a disaster in your memory? Joey: Many, I can answer that question with. I'll just do one because it's top of mind, but about.com. When we did about.com, now that's turned out in the end to be a very different business and a great business for us for reasons that are totally unrelated to our original acquisition. But when we did about.com, it was going to be integrated into ask.com, and there was an entire strategy and there was an entire sheet of synergies on the executability scale to be eights or nines out of 10. Not stretchy. Very, very easy. And we were right about a lot of that synergy. We were wrong about a lot of it too, but we were probably right about more than we were wrong, but we were way wrong about one, the fundamentals about business and how that would endure over time. And two, related, how those synergies would endure over time.So we crushed the synergies in the first year and delivered all what we thought, but we absolutely missed that the world, Google specifically, but the world did not want horizontally focused information sites. The world wanted vertically focused information. And after that first year, I forget the exact timeline, maybe it was to maybe it was a year and a half, it just went straight down and really disastrous. We bought the business, I want to say, it had 30 million in profit. That first year we took it up to 60 million in profit. And shortly after that it was losing 20 million dollars a year. It was a complete reinvention by Neil Vogel and his team that brought it back to a really good business, which we've now significantly put more capital into with a big acquisition, but that's Dot Dash now. And then we just did this acquisition Meredith that was absolutely disastrously wrong. We went from hero to zero on that one very, very quickly. Patrick: What was that change? Just finish that story to Dot Dash. I think Investopedia as maybe an example in that portfolio. Did you just flip it from horizontal to vertical and then apply some of the same ideas? What was the strategic transition? Joey: We started with Neil had an idea. And I remember we had some inkling at some point where we hired Neil, he and I went out to drinks and I said, ""You're going to look like a hero from the beginning because we've got all these synergies, and there's going to be a lot of profit, and then you're going to have to figure out where to go from there."" And at the time I said that I believed that, but I didn't know how prescient I was. I didn't think it would just fall off a cliff. And he said, ""Okay, we're going to try this,"" and I can't remember what the first thing was, but when things were going bad he said, ""We're going to try this."" And I said, ""Okay, that makes a lot of sense."" And so he went after it for however it was. Three months, six months, nine months or something like that, and it didn't work. It was some change to about.com.And I said, ""Okay, well that didn't work."" He said, ""I know. We know exactly why that didn't work. We're going to try this other thing."" And here's why it's going to work. And they put together this whole thing and it made a lot of sense. And he said, ""Okay, go do it,"" and he tried that for six months and that didn't work. That happened a third time, and the fourth time he said, ""We have to break it up because we tried every version of horizontal, and horizontal doesn't work and we have to go vertical."" So we're actually this thing that we bought that was valuable. It's a well known brand called about.com. No one knows it anymore, but it was at one point about.com. We're going to just basically get rid of that, and we're going to create ... I can't remember what it was. Six or something, new brands from scratch, and we're going to move all the content to these new brands, and we're going to clean up all the content, and we're going to have less content, and we're going to have better, less content in these verticals. We had one for health called Very Well, and one for home called Spruce, and so on across a bunch of verticals.And I said, ""Okay, this plan also makes a lot of sense,"" I said, ""But we're not going to have a fifth meeting like this. So I hope it works."" Sure enough, everything went. And this happens when you change a brand online, your URL becomes forgotten for a period, or you go to an unknown URL, and so you have no traffic, and then you build it back over time. And the curve for Dot Dash, what was about.com, became Dot Dash and all these different verticals was pretty sharp V. Maybe it was a U, but it was straight down and then boom, it went up and it just kept going up forever from there. And it was really the bottom of that U, or V, whatever it was, was very uncomfortable. But we hung on and it went up and went up forever, and that's really a credit to Neil and the team that he built there to keep trying, not giving up, and build something amazing. Patrick: It seems like a really interesting common theme here is brand roll up versus brand consolidation. You've just given an example of it. Match another example of it. Angie's been a consolidation of brands. How do you know which is the right strategy, when? Joey: Angie's a great example of we took too long on that. This is a big debate between Barry and I, where he was right in the end that we had moved too slowly to make this. He was pushing to make this change sooner, and I was resisting making this change. But we had Angie's List and we had Home Advisor, and at some point we were saying to ourselves, ""Okay, what do you get at Angie's list versus what do you get at Home Advisor?"" At some point, we didn't have an answer for that, who would do one versus the other. And we were spending a fortune on market. There were also, I think, some fundamental weaknesses is in the home advisor brand, like notwithstanding spending a billion dollars we couldn't get brand awareness above a certain level. And you would have a conversation with people, I talk about this all the time, but you'd go to the cocktail party and you'd say, ""Oh, we have Home Advisor,"" and they'd say, ""What does it do?"" ""You'd say, ""You match homeowners with service professionals,"" they'd say, ""Oh, Angie's List,"" and you'd go, ""Well, no. This Home Advisor. But yeah."" And not withstanding, at that point we were probably spending 10X on Home Advisor what Angie's List was spending on its brand. There was some fundamental flaws in that brand. But in the end we couldn't distinguish between the brands. We were spending a huge amount of money. We said, ""Well, let's concentrate all of our money in one brand.""There are times we've had exactly the opposite conclusion, which is we said, ""This brand serves this demographic. This brand has similar content, similar supply, might have identical supply base, but serves a different demographic, so it needs to be positioned in a different way and so there should be multiple brands there."" We've done that multiple times. Dot Dash does that today now with Meredith, where you talk about what's the right vacuum cleaner for a certain crowd is different than the right vacuum cleaner for another crowd, but you want to review all the vacuum cleaners and test them all out in one place. And then you can write different angles for why that's better for one demographic versus the other. It really is situation dependent, but you need a reason for the second brand to exist. And more shelf space can be a reason, but I don't think just more space in and of itself is enough, because if you could put your power behind something and say, ""We want to transform the category. We want to be a leader in this category. We want to have the best product in this category."" You'd say, ""Then you should really put all your firepower behind that thing."" It starts to be different maybe when something's more mature, and the shelf space game's a little bit different. But I think with Angie we said, ""There's not enough difference here, and we want to transform the category and we need a brand to do that."" Patrick: I think one of the most interesting things in business is the mind of the consumer and working backwards from it. And very quickly you get to category definitions, marketing versions of product positioning. And it sounds like what you're saying is you need to have a really good sense of what is a category and what isn't. And if it's one category you consolidate, if it's multiple categories, you expand, or you hold multiple assets. So what are the acid tests for, yes, this is a category. Is it personas? Is it specific use case? What have you learned about category definition and positioning? Joey: Sometimes we're very surprised by this. We think we're getting into one category and we end up with a new category. I'll go to the origin of Angie. Angie going back was Home Advisor, combination of Home Advisor and Angie's List. And before that Home Advisor was called Service Magic, which is a business we bought in 2004. We bought Service Magic more or less as part of City Search, which no longer exists. We spent a huge amount of money unsuccessfully in City Search over a period of time trying to build a local business. And we said, okay, Service Magic is in this category, which we at the time were calling local, and the local category is huge. It's the Yellow Pages. And this part of the Yellow Pages is big so that's really interesting. When I think about Angie today, I don't think about us as going after what was then the Yellow Pages advertising dollars and what is now whatever advertising dollars.Those are dollars that we go after, and are important dollars that we go after. But what I think about it today is the home and how are we transforming homeowners journey? How are we transforming what it means to own a home and the hassles of owning a home and all that? I don't think about it as what is local and how do you find a phone number? How do you find a contact or how do you find a contact in this thing? Where Angie goes in the future is what are you spending on your home and how can you make the amount of money and time and hassle you're spending on your home easier? And that's a totally different category and there's overlap in those categories, but that is a totally different definition of the category and the way we think about today versus the way we started that I said, surprises us. It shouldn’t be that surprising, but it is, it was not the original way we thought about the category. And I can make that example in other ones too.",3661
229,Joey Levin - Building an Anti-Conglomerate,Continuous Improvement in an Ever-Changing Business," Patrick: Is there anything major about just how you think generally that's changed the most from when you took the job as CEO to today? Joey: Over that period, we embraced what we are and what we do well, which is being a multi-business business, being an anti conglomerate. You talked a little bit about how this evolved. We said, ""Well, what are we good at? What have we done? What have we done well, let's lean into those things and communicate on those things."" There were times where he said, ""Well, should we present IACs earnings on a consolidated basis?"" Well, we never thought about it on a consolidated basis, so why would we present it on a consolidated basis? We should own the fact that we're a multi-business business. And we should lean into that. One of our directors earlier this week said, ""I bet not a single one of our directors could accurately say what IACS aggregate earnings per share is."" And I think that's true. And I think that's something that I'm proud of, frankly, because that's not the way we think about the business and operate the business. And we embraced that. We embraced that in the way we started communicating. We started communicating very clearly that we're a multi-business business and that we know we're allocating capital to different businesses and here's how we're thinking about it. And the first letter I wrote to shareholders was very much that. It was, here's I think what we are, and here's how I think we're going to operate going forward. And it is very much about being a multi-business business and allocating capital and looking at a sum of the parts. And we know we understand the responsibilities that puts on us to treat it as a sum of the parts and embracing that I think is different than where we started and getting comfortable with that is different than where we started. Patrick: We've talked so much about deploying capital in the unique anti-conglomerate holding company structure. Really haven't talked about where the capital comes from. So sourcing and cost of capital for any holding company is really interesting through time. Berkshire's had its float and Henry Singleton at Teledyne had his share issue and share buyback, extreme strategies. How do you think about the different tools in the toolkit for sourcing capital and the strategy for doing it? Joey: We look at everything in the toolkit, but some of the principles that we've generally tried to uphold consistently, and probably one theme from this discussion is there's not a lot of things we do consistently, but one is when we are spinning something out, we try to at least get our basis back. Our basis just means basically what we put in it, but it's more of a tax term because we get that tax free so that we can essentially recycle the capital. So in all the examples of businesses we've spun off, and I think basically every case we have gotten our basis out, or sometimes more than our basis, but generally our basis out tax free so that we can recycle that capital. And then the thing that gets fund the shareholders is pure profit, essentially. It's incremental. So that's one component in replenishing the capital. The other is, as you said, to use everything in the toolkit. So the range of things in the toolkit is issuing stock and repurposing stock, which are in opposition. But when we're talking about raising capital, it's issuing stock. We've done that. We acquired Ask Jeeves. We did that for stock, but we also at the same time said we were going to buy back half the stock that we were issuing because that was what made sense for the seller wanted stock and we wanted to issue some stock, but not that much stock. But we said we can issue stock, we can issue public stock, so ISE parent stock, we can issue subsidiary stock, public, or private. So in the case of Angie's List, we had a private subsidiary called Home Advisor, and we used that currency to buy Angie's List, meaning we merged Home Advisor into Angie's List and ended up with 87% of that company in that transaction.So we used private company currency. We've used public company currency. After that, we used the public company currency to buy Handy, which is where we got Oisin, who's the currency CEO of Angie. We took public currency and issued that to public currency of the subsidiary and issued that to our shareholders. We've done converts, which is say we don't like selling stock, but maybe we can get comfortable selling stock at a 50 or a hundred percent of premium to where we are right now. And that's a convert. And we don't mind giving the downside protection exchange for that. We've used that. And then another important one is, well, how do those instruments, and we've used debt to scrap debt also, and how do those instruments of debt or debt like securities travel with our companies? So sometimes when we spend companies off, we spend that debt or other things with it so that we could start over. But the whole toolkit always has to be available for us and it gets the same capital allocation discussion. In that discussion we are thinking about, okay, where do we put it, but also where do we get it and what are the things we can use to go get it? Patrick: It seems like the big lesson is don't do capital allocation by policy, do it by circumstance. Respect the toolkit and every situation's different and you've done it all. Joey: That's totally right. And I think you can apply that statement you just made to almost everything we do. Patrick: What brings you the most personal joy in all of this? This is sort of this open business playing field in a kind of unique way. There really isn't a company like IAC, it's really not one of its size and its track record. And it has one of the best objective track records, whether that's shareholder return, return on capital, whatever, where do you find the joy in all of that personally? Joey: I only realized this recently in the last few years, but absolutely the things that bring me the most personal joy is when the people around us are doing well, are succeeding. In other words, when our shareholders have done well, when our employees have done well, that brings me more joy than, not that I don't like to do well or do well financially or whatever, but I just vested into some stock or exercise some options. It's not like the happiest day ever like a big celebration for me personally. I'm very grateful for it and I'm not unhappy about it, but it's not a thing that brings me the same amount of joy when somebody else does and you can see the impact that it makes for them. Those are the ones that absolutely bring me the most joy. People a lot of times don't believe that because I would also be difficult and maybe an understatement in giving it away in the first place and challenging on how to do things like compensation and how to do things like what to pay for things and issuing stock. We're not easy on those things I should say. But in the end when it works and it succeeds for people that absolutely brings me the most joy. Patrick: It's kind of fun that just yesterday random juxtaposition, I did one of these with Peter Turchin and I asked him a question about Rupert Murdoch and what he learned from him and working with him, et cetera. And he told this funny story about how he was arguing with Barry Diller who gave Peter his first job or major job, I think. And Peter said to Barry, ""You're the most stubborn like pain in the ass I've ever dealt with."" And Barry said, ""No, it's Rupert. Rupert's more of a stubborn pain in the ass than me."" I'm fascinating to know what you've learned working with Barry all these years that makes him so distinctive. I think he rightfully is in some sort of Mount Rushmore depending on the Mount Rushmore of what, but he's on it, whatever it is, and is just such an intriguing business person and investor hybrid through time, that's fairly singular. So I'm very curious, what is that distinctiveness in your eyes having worked with him for so long that you'll remember most? Joey: One is pushing me and others to always think bigger and more ambitious. I use the example all the time, he'd come in and you say, ""Okay, I think we got this thing. It doesn't even exist yet."" And if we do everything right, and whenever we could build it up to a hundred million of revenue or even a hundred million of profit, why bother? That's what you're going for? Why bother? Why would you aim for something so small. And being able to reframe everything, and that goes across all areas that you see Barry do this personally. And I see him do this with the business. He's always raising the bar and that's hard on some people always raising the bar. People joke about the pencils in the conference room are always sharpened and that's because at some point Barry said, ""Well, why aren't the pencils sharpened?""And you could say, ""Well, what kind of jerk, pain in the ass makes sure the pencils sharpened?"" But you could also say, ""Well, what kind of idiot wants to be in a conference room with a bunch of dull pencils all the time?"" Just sharpen the pencils. Those things turn into legend and people say it's silly and whatever, but you have to continue raising the bar. You have to continue to not be satisfied with what you have and you have to continue to figure out how to push to make it better, make the product better, make it aesthetically better, make the service better. If you don't challenge the thing that's not working, then you won't get it to work. So some people don't like to be challenged. Well, it's not that big a deal that this thing doesn't work. We don't even use it that much.Okay, well then get rid of it. But don't have a thing that doesn't work here. Either make it work or get rid of it. And don't tolerate a thing that doesn't work being here. That thing of constantly raising the bar and relentlessly raising the bar, it's a big challenge, but it is an important lesson on how to go for excellence. And then the other one, which has been a bit of a theme today is being open minded, being willing to be challenged and being willing to challenge others. And that candor and transparency is something I learned very much from Barry and very much a lesson in the company. If you're not talking about what the issues are, you're not going to solve the issues. If you're not raising the issues, you're not going to solve this. If you're not challenging the decision, then you maybe not getting to the right decision because you're not raising the issues that come with that. That's definitely been a theme. Patrick: I love what you said earlier, just to put a final point on it of maybe what started as an opportunity to reveal inventory digitally in an OTA or something now is the, just give me the one that's the best in work, go from collection to curation and completely change the model. That is the theme I'll take from this, that everything's idiosyncratic, everything's the result of constant change. And if you're going to win, you got to constantly improve. And it seems like IACs been one of the companies to study for investors out there just because the number of experiments you've run and done on to learn that lesson. Really, really interesting stuff. Joey: And evolution by the way is important too, because you need all those hotels or all those flights or all those whatever in there to pick the one you couldn't otherwise get there. It evolves. Patrick: So it's the next available convenience jump, not the ideal. You have to respect reality. Joey: That's exactly right. That process of building can be hard and messy and different, but that's going to be necessary. Patrick: Joey, I've had so much fun doing this. I ask everybody on the podcast the same traditional closing question. What is the kindest thing that anyone's ever done for you? Joey: When Jack Welch was an advisor for IAC and he became a very close friend and mentor and I distinctly recall this, but he didn't have to do this, but he held my hand in a way and brought me with him to a bunch of people and to a bunch of things in ways where he said that were welcoming and validating in ways that he didn't need to do that with his personal brand, which was the sort of greatest in the world from business and his personal capital, which is exceptional with everybody who knows him well. And he did that in the most gracious and the most generous and the kindest way possible. And I'll never forget that he did that and how well he did that. Many people have done many nice things for me in my life. But you think about kindness as like kindness requires some level of self-sacrifice and putting yourself at risk or stepping out in a way and I think that Jack really did that with himself in ways where he just didn't have to, but he did for me and I deeply, deeply appreciate it. Patrick: I'm so pleased to hear your answer. My cousin did the same thing for me, effectively giving me his social capital, this was at college, and he, as a result, it introduced me to my wife, my best man, another groomsman. He went way above and beyond. He didn't need to do any of that. He needed to take me out for one beer or something, but I love the sacrifice and the spending of capital, the social capital to benefit somebody else. It's a beautiful thing and I love the definition of kindness. So what a cool place to end. Joey, this has been so much fun. Joey: Patrick, thanks a lot. I really enjoyed this too and love what you're doing and love the whole concept of the intellectual curiosity behind your podcast here.

230,Peter Chernin - Betting on Passion,Introduction," Patrick: My guest today is Peter Chernin, who has had a hall of fame career in the entertainment business. Peter ran News Corp and Fox for 15 years between 1996 and 2009, before co-founding the Chernin Group, which has become one of the leading investment firms in the consumer space. Along the way, he has also produced a number of blockbuster films, including Titanic, Avatar, The Greatest Showman, and The Planet of the Apes trilogy. Please enjoy this wonderful discussion with Peter Chernin.",115
231,Peter Chernin - Betting on Passion,Blockbuster Lessons," Patrick: Peter, thanks so much for doing this with me. I thought an interesting place to start, given the wide berth of your career, would be with two movies that everyone would be familiar with. Those being Titanic and Avatar. Be interesting to hear, obviously, James Cameron behind both of them, how Titanic came to be or that partnership came to be. But was business and even investing lessons, if you think about the movie as a huge outlay of capital during a return, what business and investing lessons stand out from the production of those two movies? Peter: Titanic was infinitely more influential because it was much more problematic. I was at a different stage of my career, it had a huge impact on teaching me things, et cetera, and was the nightmare of all nightmares. Whereas by the time I got to Avatar, I'd already lived through it. Trust me, it's still really challenging, but it wasn't as challenging. Had an insane amount of confidence driven by Titanic.The Titanic background is I'd been made head of the movie studio when I was, I don't know, 41 I think. I had no background in movies, I was a television guy. We had a snowball deal with Jim Hammond at the studio and he'd already made Terminator one and two and the Element, so he was a big, important guy. I didn't know what I was doing, by the way. I was completely trying to learn on the job really quick and I had no one to really help me and I was the chairman and CEO, so it was incumbent on me to figure it out quickly.Probably in the first three months or so I was there, Jim brought in True Lies and it was a great script. Arnold Schwarzenegger then the biggest movie star in the world, Jim Cameron arguable as good a director in the world. I said to myself, ""Wow, this is easy. I'm good at this job. It's a piece of cake."" I loved the script and blah, blah, blah. I green lit that movie, which is essentially saying I said yes to it. I don't know, probably about $85 million dollar budget, which was probably either the highest or certainly the top two or three most expensive movies ever made at that point. But it's fine and we ran into what at the time seemed like really big budget problems at the beginning. We had a $15 million dollar budget problem early on, and I freaked out I didn't know what to do.I had a really meaningful conversation with Jim at that point, where I was, by the way, winging it. But the gist of it was I basically said, ""Look, you're potentially incompetent. I don't believe that's true. You potentially just set out to defraud us, I don't believe that's true. What seems more likely to be true is that you are having problems and that you have a knee jerk paranoia about sharing those problems with the studio. Let me be clear, if you share your problems with me, I'll be the best partner you ever had. And if you don't, this is going to get really ugly."" Somehow that conversation was a real breakthrough for both of us. We sat down over the course of that weekend and got the perfect conversation that you want to have with somebody creative, where he said, ""Look, I can cut this and save $1 million dollars here. I can cut this and do this. I can shoot this slightly differently."" But then he'd say, ""I will kill you before I change this scene. I would run over my mother.""So we probably got $8 million or $9 million of the $15 million dollars back. It was a real seminal experience. You want directors who feel incredibly strong with that stuff and you also want directors who are collaborative. Jim was near perfect in that sense. There were things he said, ""I can't change this, it's going to ruin the money and I will never do it."" And there are other things he'd say, ""Look, I can shoot this slightly differently, I can get three quarters of a million dollars in it. So we forged a really good relationship out of that. Patrick: What, if anything, do you think unites his movies in terms of what defines great content? Just seems unquestionably True Lies, Avatar, Titanic, these are enormous, original works that weren't derived from books necessarily or source material, like so many of the Marvel movies and the last decade's been all sequels. What did those experiences with him teach you about what it means to be great content in the first place? Why did those things so take off, do you think? Peter: First of all, True Lies actually was a remake of a small, French movie. So there was some source material there. First and foremost, genius, that's unites. He's just a genius. To dig a little deeper, I think he is an extraordinary humanistic storyteller. I think these stories have great heroes, real heroic journeys that you want to follow. Generally big underdogs and situations, really strong female characters. I think weirdly, one of the things Jim regularly gets underestimated about, or people have forgotten, Jim has historically always been one of the best writers in Hollywood. Extraordinarily gifted writer and just a really human storyteller. I think that unites them.It's almost impossible to get bored in a Jim Cameron movie. And a lot of people look at him as such a spectacle director, but he's just so human. Give you a good example. The lead in Avatar, the guy who ultimately puts on the suit and travels, we were probably on our fourth or fifth draft of the script where Jim came in and said, ""I have really good idea. I want to change him to a man who is a quadriplegic."" Think about that opening scene where he puts on the suit and goes and runs across the field. It's just so insanely human and compelling and you just have this enormous sense of what this means to that character emotionally. That's some kind of weird level of genius.There's that on that side and then he's just technologically adept as anyone I've ever met. He's constantly pushing the boundaries of filmmaking from a technological point of view. One of the things, and I'll come back and talk about the Titanic experience, which is where we started, but one of the things that I really thought about significantly both in Titanic and Avatar, was if you look back over history, the number one movie of all time tends to be at that given moment, the movie which has pushed spectacle and effects furthest. Whether that was Gone With The Wind in those days, was probably Jaws and Star Wars, Jurassic Park at one point, because you get this phenomenon of wonder. What you're hoping for is people coming out of the theater and saying to their friends, ""Oh, my God! I can't believe what I just saw,"" and then they go, ""My God, I better go see that.""That's part of what gave me the confidence to green light these movies that were extraordinary numbers. Both Titanic and Avatar when they were made, were the most expensive movies ever made. But I felt in the case of Titanic, that effects previously had been used in the service of fantasy: outer space, dinosaurs coming to life, et cetera, and that no one had ever seen state-of-the-art special effects to try and recreate something realistic. I felt that that would be compelling in Titanic, and then in Avatar, what I felt was there had been a bunch of, Okay 3D movies, but no one had ever fully explored and realized the ultimate potential in 3D and I have great confidence that you could do that. Patrick: One of the defining characteristics of say the last 10 years has been the dominance of series and sequels at the box office. Obviously, you've bucked this trend, making movies like Ford versus Ferrari and other more original first of their kinds. And I know that's something that you pride yourself on as a producer. What do you think is behind that change and that trend towards box office dominance in the movie industry by already familiar characters, movies, franchises? Peter: I would say one is just caution. People are afraid to make big original things. Ironically those big franchise, I guess you'd say the three biggest franchises out there, which are Marvel, Lucasfilm, and now Avatar. All three of those franchises originated in Fox, Lucasfilm, clearly before I was there. But we made the first modern day marvel movie, we made the first X-Men movie in 2000 and 2001, long before Disney bought the company, before Spider Man, before… So at the end of the day, if you're willing to take risks, you can ultimately create more economic value by building new franchises than just continue to milk them. But if you're cautious and running with seemingly a pure rational business and trying to eliminate risk in that business, so you make lots of sequels and franchise movies who makes because it's just a safer bet. They're less risky, they are pre marketed, et cetera.I think from a corporate side, some of it is just good questions business, some of it in my opinion, is excessive caution business. And unfortunately, you are in a creative business, which means you are supposed to create things, I think people should take bigger risks, or your job in there is to manage risk and figure out a way to do it in a rational way because you can create real economic value.The second piece is clearly and particularly at Marvel, from an audience point of view they have done an amazing job of tapping into the peeling characters and probably even more so appealing mythologies, and building out those mythologies. And so the combination of the appeal of those mythologies, with state of the art special effects and spectacle seems to be working, and that seems to be clearly is working. And it's clearly appealing points is whether I personally seen nothing works forever but I've been proved wrong in the past and we'll see.",2158
232,Peter Chernin - Betting on Passion,The Business of Making Noise," Patrick: If you take your career as the through line, it seems as though you've always had this deep felt sense of where the tail winds are, and maybe where the winds are shifting, and you making changes in your career accordingly to get back behind the tailwinds. How would you describe the tailwinds of the first chunk of your career maybe up through the founding of the turning group and the shifting in your personal focus, what did those tailwinds feel like, and what were the winds of change that caused you to move to the next chapter? Peter: I'm not sure I'm all that brilliant at identifying tailwinds. I was probably 70% luck. Certainly in the early stages of my career, most of it was luck, certainly up until I became head of the movie studio from ‘90 to ‘96. I'm not sure I was overwhelmingly smart at identifying tailwinds, I happen to have been the benefit of extraordinary talents. Look back and think about the traditional media business through that period of time, you just had these constant explosions, which you had this explosion of packaged goods advertising, which drove the traditional broadcast industry through the ‘80s, I guess I would say, you then have in the mid ‘80s, early in mid ‘80s, through the next 30 years, you have trillion dollars, half a trillion dollars of cable money coming into the business. And so that was this extraordinary tailwind for the media business up until 5, 10 years ago and you can see that today. But maybe arguably the greatest tailwind of all time.You then had this explosion of international disability for American content to be monetized all over the world, that was hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars over the ‘80s, ‘90s, early ones, you had several $100 billion dollars of DVD money coming to business. So there was this long period of time, pretty much through the 2008 recession where technology globalization, growth of the US consumer economy, all resulted in this wild tailwinds for your business. I did have some foresight to get into the cable business in the early ‘80s. So I guess I was intrigued by that.But a lot of it, I was just the beneficiary. I do have one, I don't know if it's a skill set. But one thing which certainly defines me, which is, I both get bored and I'm really interested in what's new. It just fascinates me what's new, and what's coming. So I was working for one of the, it was my first job in Hollywood, and I was working for one of the biggest traditional television producers. It was my first job. And I was offered a job at this sort of upstart thing called Showtime, which half of my friends hadn't heard of. And it just seemed super interesting to me. And all my friends said I was insane, “How could you leave the broadcast business? That's all bullshit. It's crummy level.” And that turned out to have been, arguably the defining moment of my career, because it taught me a bunch of things, which came to define the media business over the next 20 or 30 years. I'm happy to elaborate on what that is, if you'd like. Patrick: Yeah, that'd be great. I think those early lessons, then can inform a lot of the other topics that we'll touch on, so yeah, please do. Peter: What that taught me. What I came to realize pretty quickly in that job was that we were subscription business. We were tiny subscription business. We probably had 15, 20 million subscribers when I joined. And we were growing by 200,000 to 300,000 jobs a month. Business was great. What I realized somewhere in the first several months, I was hired as head of original programming, was the, wait a second. We are not in the mass market business in the ways that the broadcast networks are. The broadcast networks, up until that point, had been defined by, there was a very famous acronym, arguably, the single best television programmer of all time was a guy named Fred Silverman, was the only person to have run all three traditional broadcast networks, CNN, CBS, ABC, and NBC. And he coined this acronym, probably in the late ‘70s early ‘80s, called, LOP, least objectionable programming.His thought was, if you only have three choices, there's only three networks, the person who has the least objectionable program is going to win. And that was really the way broadcast television worked, is you really wanted to not offend people, and not annoy people and not turn anybody off. And so I got to Showtime over this tiny little platform, and I woke up one day and said, “Wait a second, this is exactly the opposite. I'm in the opposite business, I'm in a noise business.” And I had this mental image of what I really wanted to do was come up with content that was so noisy, that someone would say, “Oh, you got to watch this thing.” Blah, blah, blah, whatever it is. And their friends are like, “What is that?” They say, “Well, it's a comedy.” Then they say, “Well, I've never heard that.” And then they would say, well, it's on Showtime. And they would say, “Well, it’s on Showtime.” Then they say, What’s Showtime?” And they say, “Well, it's a subscription service.” And then they would go sign up.And I woke up and said, “I'm in the business of making noise. I'm in the attention getting business. I'm not in the defense business.” And I believe that that has characterized every single thing that has gone on with entertainment and a lot of technology over because this is a broad general statement. But nobody obviously can tell you exactly what technology leads to. But in general, it leads to two things from a consumer perspective, it leads to more choice and more control, you end up having what becomes near infinite ubiquitous choice, and you end up having the ability to do what you want, when you want to do, how you want to do it.And in that world, noise and attention getting is really, really important, because you've got a breakthrough, grab people's attention. Not because I'm so smart, but I was lucky enough to learn that lesson at Showtime in the mid ‘80s. It's 100% the reason why, you know I went from there to go become the head of the Fox network in the very early days. And the Fox network exploded because we had these very conservative stayed competitors in ABC, NBC, CBS, and all we did was programmed to get attention. So we did The Simpsons, we did the Cops, we did 90210, we did Married With Children. And they were the opposite of safe broadcast shows. And what it taught me is that the safe competitor can always be taken down by the person who's willing to take the risks and be noisier. Patrick: We'll come back to this area, but just to zoom all the way to the present. It seems like so much of what you just described defines TCGs investing activities that the content heavy businesses that you've backed, are incredibly niche and specific. Maybe noise is not still the right word, but something like that. They appeal to a very, very specific sub genre or community or whatever. If you zoom all the way back now to today, how has that played out in your investing for those that are less familiar with TCG, maybe just say a word on an example or two of that thesis you learned that Showtime applied in 2022. Peter: Easy analogy is to substitute the word passion for noise, not trying to do these broad generic appeal stuff you're trying to do things that people feel really passionate about. So if you look at various businesses of ours, whether it's Food52, whether it's MeatEater, whether it’s Barstool Sports, Goldin Auctions, et cetera. These are all things that people feel really passionate about. And I think if you look at the content heavy businesses we've done all of, those are all content heavy businesses, they have generally crunchy rolls, for example, which was an early investment of ours, they've generally done wildly better than the Boxes, the BuzzFeed, by the way, I'm not trying to put anything down. But the sort of broader Internet content businesses. Because we have hugely passionate audiences. When we start evaluating these kinds of things, we are looking for signals of passion. And among those signals that we tend to look at is, well, we have advertising lines in those businesses, none of them are advertising dependent.One of the early signals we look for is, is there an indication that people are willing to pay for something, whether that's a subscription in the case of punch and roll, whether that's pots and pans equipment in the case of Food52, whether that's a lot of merch, Kiss Bar Stool, et cetera, because it's a real signal of passion. And so I think there's a real analogy and a real through line from this idea of making noise at Showtime to betting on passion.If you look at what's happened to the world over those past 20 or 30 years, the broadcast networks back in the ‘70s ’80s, were surviving on what I would characterize in the middle, stuff that was inoffensive to the largest number of people. What's happened is the middle in every single business is gone, gone, gone forever. And the world is split into two things, these gigantic events, the Marvel movies, the Super Bowl, the Grammys, The Beatles documentary, whatever those things are, Hamilton, where technology enables those events, technology is largely supercharged those events, they've enabled you to deliver them to people all over the world.And then the second thing that's happened is technology's enabled niche passions. And if you think about yourself as a consumer of entertainment, a consumer of anything, you gravitate towards those two things, you want to say, “I want to be part of that big event, I want to watch the Super Bowl, I want to watch the new Marvel movie, I'd have to go see Hamilton from New York.” Or you want to indulge your greatest passions, I love knitting, or I love hunting, or I love high quality watches. You know holding key is another portfolio company of ours.And I want to really dive down the rabbit hole of those things that I'm passionate about. And the last thing you ever want to do is spend time on something that feels generic and safe in the middle. Because you don't need to anymore. You either want to be part of those big global events, or you want to indulge your own specific passions. And the last thing you need in this life is to be wasting time in the middle. Patrick: Do you think that that basically applies everywhere in business? I remember distinctly this term you used, the first time we ever talked, you hold it phony aggregators, which I think is maybe another way of saying the middle. Maybe eBay is an example of a phony aggregator and more niche specific marketplaces like Stock X or GOAT, or like the business equivalent of the media examples that you've just given is that kind of what you mean by phony aggregator? Peter: I guess I'd said this way in Web 2.0, late 1.0 early 2.0. Aggregation became a huge phenomenon, because I could use technology to bring a whole bunch of things together. I believe that is what has happened since then is as technology, this is really probably mostly 1.02 or 2.0. As technology is advanced people could discover whatever they want. So to use eBay example and I'm not calling them phony, but people who are really into sneakers can go to GOAT, people who are really into trading cards can go to Golden auctions and Collector's Universe.And people have the navigation skills, the passion, the tools to go really deep in those things they want. Aggregation would seem revelatory, when it first started almost every technology. Over time were thin because you are depending upon casualness and technology just engineers a lot of casualness. Clearly the best example of that, two really good examples, which we spend a lot of time thinking about, one is clearly the cable universe. When all of this first got cable in the ‘80s and ‘90s you would come home and go, “Oh my God, there's 100 channels, it's Nirvana. I can't believe that progress, the Jetsons were living in amazing world,” et cetera. 20 years later you go, “I've never watched country television, I've never watch court TV.”The average American in Thaiday, watch 12 to 13 cable channels, and they have 200 or 300. And so you begin to realize, “Well, I'm paying for all this aggravation I don't really care about.” And I'm smart enough to figure out how to get to this movie or this sporting event or this news channel, whatever it is. So that's good example.The other great example of it is the shopping mall, shopping mall was seen probably back in the 50s, I guess. I don't know when they exactly started ‘50s, I guess ’50s, ‘60s. Shopping mall seemed like, “Oh, my God, this is heaven. I can't believe that there are 150 stores in this place. And I can go buy clothes, I could go buy sporting equipment, I could go buy electronics, I can go buy anything. It's amazing.” You go to that now, it just seems really middle. It's not the best clothes. It's not the best sporting goods. It's not the best sneakers. It's not the best electronics. Consumers have moved on from those sorts of things. It's a really broad, stupid thesis. But it goes back to that notion of technology gives you choice and control. Used to be that.The only place you getting choice was to go to shopping mall, you were happy with the 100 stores that were there. You wake up today, you can click on Amazon, basically purchase every single thing that’s ever been made. And when you want it then get it delivered, you don't have to drive, you don't have to navigate your way through the mall and get it delivered. So this notion of choice and control is inexorable. It's the sort of ongoing march and it definitively changes consumer behavior and generally drives out the middle and drives out aggregators, which seemed revelatory to be in because progress, technological advancement tends to really impact us. Patrick: I think it was Jim Barksdale that said, ""There's two ways to make money in business: bundling and unbundling."" And it seems like a lot of what you've described is a great era of unbundling and direct relationship with superfans that has been what technology has enabled, certainly in media but in these other examples as well. Peter: I know you've talked to my partner's Jesse Jacobs with Mike Kerns. When we started TCG, we spent a lot of time trying to think about, I'm a big believer that the best way to be smart is differentiate yourself. It's really hard to be smart if you're doing the same thing everybody else is doing. It's much easier to be smart if you're really coming up with a differentiated point of view.And what our point of view really spent a lot of time talking about this in the early days was that we felt like these bundles were going to get disaggregated. And we felt that consumers were going to start doing everything directly with brands that they cared about. And we felt on top of that this had started in the media business probably first. I would argue the first place we've had such experience and it would argue the 1st place happened was the record business. The record album was one of the great phony aggregations of all time, which is you're interested in buying one song, and you had to buy an album with 12 songs on it for 15 bucks.And you saw that as soon as first Napster but then soon as they were legitimate places where you could buy that one song for a buck people in early on iTunes. And then it went even once a further the subscription services. But people go, “Why would I ever buy 12 songs that I don't want when I just want this once I don't pay a dollar for?” And the media business we lived through that. When I was at Nesco. We're the largest newspaper publisher in the world. Newspaper, perfect aggregator you back in from probably what the late 70s, through 2000. You would get thrown on your doorstep in the morning, an aggregation of international news, national news, sports, entertainment, business, a bunch of things and all thrown together. And then you woke up because of technology and the internet and some people said, “I'm interested in business or I'm interested in sports. I'm just going to go find the sports in the sidewalk.” And other people said, “I'm not interested in the superficial view of internationals, I'm going to dig deep into the economist or whatever that is.”So the newspaper and the newspaper business got completely destroyed because of classified ads. So the newspaper business was being driven by, economically being driven a little bit by subscriptions, broad national advertising, which as things became more specialists, and I don't need to advertise poorly there, and primarily classify the apps. And you saw the classified ad business disappear because of eBay for goods because of the job sites, because of the car sites, et cetera. We have been witness to that. And then I was witnessing the early days of the disaggregation of the video business. We had launched Hulu, I had launched Hulu with Jeff Zucker at NBC, we launched it together in 2007, I think. We had already witnessed these things. And so when we started TCG, we had a view of these trends were going to happen everywhere. And we could really do well participating in this direct to consumer economy. And that's really what all of our investments are. Patrick: You brought up Hulu which is such an interesting thing to have observed and been a part of creating and growing I'm sure. Is that having an unusual ownership and corporate history where it's both a technology innovation in a lot of the ways you've described, but also like a strange story in many ways. What lessons do you take from that episode, I'm sure there are positive and negative ones? Peter: This is, in many ways self serving. But I think it's been wildly mismanaged. When we started it, and Jeff, who's now the head of CNN was a wonderful partner. We had this vision that it seemed clear to me that our content was all going to be on Internet. And then I had two second thoughts. And by the way, Netflix hadn't launched yet, when Jeff and I would do more this work. We had two broad thoughts. Number one was, I had spent a lot of time thinking about piracy back from the days when I was running the movie business. What I learned over time was I became clear that we're piracy thrives is where goods and services aren't available in the form that people want, and also aren't available at the price people want. And if you can make things available, before they want AI in their home on screening home and prices seem reasonable, you will destroy piracy, but 80, whatever percent of it will go away, because most people will participate in legitimate forms of business.And so I was concerned about, if we didn't get our stuff onto the web somebody's going to steal it. And I kept looking at the record business example. And then the second thing that I felt was, you had watched 20 years earlier, maybe 30 or so earlier, HBO had built this great business then. Basically, from licensing our movies, it seemed clear to me that someone was going to build a service, someone was going to use our content. And I didn't want it to be a third party, I wanted us to own it. And so that's what the impetus behind tool. Every single person in my company and NBC hated it. Every single one, the advertising people would say, “You're going to kill my regime, destroy my advertising.” The broadcast people would say, “Oh, my God, you can't give our broadcast shows, can't put them on a digital platform three days later and destroy our book of business.” The cable people said the same thing as the other people, “The syndication people will never sell anything in syndication.”And what I kept saying to him is, “You know what? Shut up and go back to your office. Your job is not to protect your business, because you can't protect your businesses. Your job is to maximize your business if you're running syndication, if you're running out ad sales.” My job is to build newer businesses faster than the old ones decay. I'm not going to not innovate in this area in the order protect these other old businesses.And Jeff, had exactly the same fights at NBC. We both left at almost exactly the same time, I think I left a little bit ahead of them. But we both left, because I remember he left as soon as Comcast bought contested the deal for NBC three months after I left, so he probably left year later. And as soon as we both left, both of those companies started listening to the people who were trying to protect their business. So they would dramatically increase the app load. They started holding back high quality content. And I would argue that it as they started going out of their way, wildly frustrate Jason Kiowa, who was our CEO. And I would argue it's one of the great business debacles of modern time because that thing was 100X better content than Netflix did launch within a year of each other. There's a 100X better content. And Netflix today is a 200 plus billion dollar company. And Fox ended up being sold years ago for $70 million. And I don't believe they were well managed. I think it's a great example of the dangers of traditional businesses trying to protect themselves. Patrick: What an incredible episode around creative destruction, disruptive innovation and such a neat story. If you think back even before that, to working with Rupert Murdoch, at News Corp and Fox and everywhere, what most stands out in memory that made him most distinctive relative to other media leaders. We just look at it numbers alone, like compounding shareholder value, for example, just sort of dominate relative to other leaders. What was most distinctive that made that possible, in your experience with them? Peter: There were a number of factors. He was the single bravest person I've ever met. While embracing of risk he was the most determined person I ever met. I was actually hired at Fox by Barry Diller. I love Barry, Barry was great to ME. The whole key to Barry's very really challenges you and so you spent a lot of time arguing with Barry. I remember us having one argument with him once and I said, “Oh, my God, you're the most willful fucking guy I've ever met in my life. You are so, so, so will man.” And he said, “Stop right there, Rupert is.” And I said, “You know what? You're probably right. Rupert taught me. So he really the bravest person I know in business.” And that was a great experience to connect him. He is so determined. And that was a great experience, which is, if you put your head down, you will get almost everything right. If you're paying attention, if you're humble, if you're constantly correcting, you'll get almost everything right, unless you run out of capital, as long as you don't run out of capital and be keep trying to figure it out you'll win. You look at virtually every business, we started Fox, and we started most of those businesses, we would do a certain amount of half assed business planning, which is supposed to do, we've launched them and then we would start changing a week later.We go, “Okay, these eight things didn't work, we probably do less of that. This thing worked a little with this thing really worked let's do more of that.” And you just keep evolving and getting it right. Rupert's incredible, that's a really valuable thing. He is infinitely curious. He's relentlessly curious about where the world is going. That was a really valuable thing. And then I guess the final thing is that he had a huge advantage over everybody else in the industry, which is he was international. He came out of Australia, and then England and then the US. So in a period of time where the business went from being a US cottage business to being a global business. He had a huge head start because he understood that already. Patrick: It's a fascinating leadership style and the word bravery really stands out there. Is there an episode that stands out in memory that would bring that word to life? I'm curious what that word bravery means in a business context? Peter: I'm not sure it's episode, but you think about some of the things we did, the Fox Network, the greatest triumph Williams human history was rebroadcast networks. Seemed like an act of insanity to try and take them on that. When he launched Fox News against CNN, CNN was the dominant, dominant, dominant thing that seemed insane. When we launched Fox Sports to try and win the NFL away from the like there's no instant take on ESPN, that seemed insane. Watching this guy do to take on the BBC, of all places it's a government monopoly. Almost every one of those big initiatives was an act of wild bravery.And the other thing that is was remarkable about Rupert is that, if he didn't like you was kind of a nightmare. That's different than most people it was just a little bit more overt about it. But if he liked you, Rupert was willing to get the board from more autonomy than anybody. Rupert gave me insane amounts of autonomy. And by the way, when he picked me to be president of the company, I was a creative guy. Up until three years ago I had never even run a business, I was just running creative things. I had actually run the movie studio so that was a real business. But then he basically said, “I want you to run the whole company.” I've never been to business school, I've never taken a business course. But I also think that's an example of whether or not there was a good decision or not, others would have to judge.But I think his view was, at its core, this is a creative business, we are making creative products, and I can find people to run the business side. But if our product isn't great, we're doomed. And if our product is great, we'll find plenty of good accountants to run the other parts of it. And I think, in some ways, that's a mirror of his background, which is, at his core, he's a journalist but he's clearly a very bright businessman. But I think at its core, if he had a view of the quality of my product, the quality of my front page is going to determine my success.",5994
233,Peter Chernin - Betting on Passion,Capturing the Emerging Zeitgeist," Patrick: Again, looking at your story, maybe at your core, at least part of your core, you're a filmmaker. If you look at what you've continued to do, even as you change from one career sort of into TCG, and all the interesting ways we've talked about and technology affecting everything. You've continued to make really interesting movies. I remember you saying something to me one time, which is in the movie business, you have to, I think you said divine the zeitgeist a few years ahead of time, and then launch something into that emerging zeitgeist, which probably makes you agree, investor too, is there, let's say in the last 10 or 15 years movie that you've made that you're most proud of and why? Peter: First of all, let me just refer, which I believe it's exactly the same with an investor. I think both of them you are trying, and that is exactly the term I've used. You're trying to divine the zeitgeist of the world public two-three years out when the movies come out. And I think investing is the same kind of curiosity, you're trying to divine, where people's needs are, where people's desires are, where people's frustrations are, and trying to invest against it.The movie is first of all, they're all my children in some ways now. Some of them are probably better children than others but in terms of movies. But I'll give you a couple of examples that I'm really proud. I'm incredibly proud of this Planet of the Apes movies. I made three of them. I think they are both big events spectacles, but I think they're extremely well done really smart, have something to say. Pretty extraordinary technological achievements, so I'm very proud of those. I'm very proud of moving like hidden figures which I think is important and meaningful story. And if you have the ability to tell a story like that you can really have an impact on the world that's meaningful, really proud as you know like greatest showman, which I've produced because brought such extraordinary joy to people.I'm insanely proud of Ford versus Ferrari just because I think it's an amazingly crafted movie. It is well made movie, as I've seen in decades, great storytelling, beautiful shot, exciting, emotional, funny, incredibly well acted, really good. But I'm also proud of… I made these three little horror movies last year. And by the way, I don't like horror movies they scare me. Patrick: Me too. Peter: I'm not proud of them in that sense. But an executive who worked for us named Corey Adelson came to general topic and I general works. And said, “I want to make these Fear Street movies. I grew up on the Fear Street books. Sold 100 million copies of Fear Street books. I grew up on them. I want to make one of them.” I said, “Great. Go wild, have fun.” We were talking, I said, “You know what? I have an idea. Why don't we make three of them at once? And why don't we release them two weeks apart?” And what I was thinking was A, if it's such a big franchise, it's economically viable which makes meaningful ones. But I was really interested in trying to shake up the way movies get released, because I felt like people have become accustomed to bingeing everything. And I felt it was a way to really eventise these movies. We ended up doing really innovative storytelling, the first movie took place in the ‘90s, and they were traditional horror movies, quite well made, by the way. Among the best reviewed horror movies in years.But firstly took place in the ‘90s, you get to the end, you think the killers got in the killer comes back. And then all of a sudden, the characters realize, “Oh, in order… And somebody says to survive the storm for. Really understand this, you got to go back to summer camp in the 1970s. And so the second movie takes place in the 1970s. And then you get to the end of that, they still haven't suffered from it. Ultimately realized that, “Wow, this curse started in the 1660s.” And so the third movie takes place half in 1666, and then goes back to the ‘90s to finish. And I'm really proud of insensitive as innovative. I'm not the best judge how this is a horror movie, per se, because it's good. But I'm really proud of its innovation, because I care about that stuff. I have an obligation to innovate and to take chances and to be able to be great. Patrick: You've probably worked with more high profile creative people, certainly in the movie business, but maybe it's really large than just about anybody across your career. But would you say the keys are to being an effective partner to genius, talented, creative people? Peter: Giving a lot of thought, because in any of those jobs, you are a business person trying to manage creativity. And it's a bit of an oxymoron managing creativity, because creativity is messy and divine, and all those sorts of things, and business is measured and predictable, and all of those sorts of things. And yet, that is what you're doing is you're trying to manage creativity. It's not necessarily the key, but it's the thing that I think is most helpful to think about in terms of managing creativity. I don't think most people realize how terrifying and vulnerable it is to be creative. If you think about it. If you think about a writer, a writer goes and sits alone in a room and pours sweat and it's like the old saying, the act of sitting at a typewriter till blood comes out of your forehead. It's incredibly challenging and painful and lonely. And then you turn it over to someone like, “Oh, that sucks. I don't like that character.” And it's heartbreaking, it's you're really vulnerable.Think about an actor, it's the most vulnerable thing on earth. You're trying to inhabit another character and you turn around and someone says, “She looks fat. I don't like him. I don't like the way he smiles.” So think about directing, which is arguably the most complex single activity, which is, I don't think most people think about, it is, weirdly the closest thing to being God. Because you think about a big filmmaker, you are literally making 1000s of world building decisions everyday, you're saying, “I don't like where that button is. I don't like the color of the shawl. I don't like where her hair is falling in that shot. I don't like the emotion there. I don't like the angle of the sunlight there. It's too shadowy here. I don't like that car in the background. That period thing doesn't look realistic. That's not the way either space would work.” It's an insane amount of both art direction decisions, music decisions, costume decisions, writing decisions, emotional decision, acting decision, and there are 1000s of them coming at you hundreds of minutes that you are individual created since you have to make them.More comes out about that fact, that wasn't very good, that was boring. And so it is a insanely vulnerable, personally risky activity. And your single biggest job as a manager of those people is to create a place where they feel safe, because you want them to take chances. The worst artists, the stuff that's lame and safe. The best start is the stuff that's really bold and risky. And your job is to create an environment where they can do that without bankrupting the company. And it's a real challenge. And we have to really think about, how do you manage those two things? And it goes back full circle to that first initial conversation I had with Jim Cameron was so meaningful, I sort of lucked into a way of encouraging him to be great, and trying to get away to get him to work with me to not be great at infinite cost. And he was phenomenal. He was the best partner ever. Patrick: I remember talking too. I think it was Mike Kerns, was the first person introduced me to the idea of just all these great companies you've cited Crunchyroll, Hodinkee, Barstow, whatever it is, just don't meddle with the creative people, like create that space around them, try to help them manage everything but that, but for God's sake, don't be the person saying, “That's no good.” Or, “I don't like that idea.” Let them do their thing. Peter: I guess I would say different version of that is, I believe your job both as a big executive, when I was running Fox and I had 30, or 40 different companies reporting to me. Or in a TCG situation, where we have three or four portfolio companies is you have three roles to play. And meddling and managing the business is not one of them. One role is just people hiring and firing people. Finding the best team. If you have a real problem, you've got to step up and deal with it. But that's job number one. Job number two, and most of the jobs just strategy, just talking to them about strategy. And then job number three is you're there to roll up your sleeves when we can be helpful. Because there's a problem or there's an opportunity and they say, “Would you call so and so or could you help me solve this problem?” But your job is not to run the business and to tell them how to run the business. And I think I would like to believe we're good at that at TCG. And Mike and Jesse are extraordinarily good.Because I'll give you the flip side of being an entrepreneur or a creative. The two things that we have but they don't have to offer are, we have objectivity. If you're an entrepreneurs business, you're locked in your head, basically, thinking about that business 24 hours a day, seven days a week. And there are times when it's very helpful to have someone say, “I don't get that homepage. I'm not telling you you won't. But I'm telling you as a user, that doesn't really work for me, or it's the same thing, you'll save a script, look at this character, I'm not quite sure what you're trying to do. And it's generally those conversations, those objective conversations are better posed as questions. They're not, “You're a fucking idiot, that doesn't work.” It's more like, “I don't get this.” And that kind of objectivity is you're really valuable to a creator or an entrepreneur, because by definition, you're so deeply in it, you don't have that kind of objectivity.And then the second thing that hopefully you bring in both investment sensation and equivalence is you bring some marketplace knowledge, the marketplace won't pay for that, or something like that just came out. Or there's another movie with that exact plot line, or there's no reason they should know and you bring that knowledge before. Those are your main values in this. And other than that, in both cases, you are trying to create support systems and help them with strategy because that is where objectivity and marketplace knowledge comes in and help them with support. Shouldn't be doing this thinking you know their business better than them or micromanaging their business, because it's fucking annoying. And they're killing themselves seven days a week, hundreds of hours a weekend. Patrick: My second to last question for you is about just the future of, I guess media writ large, specifically around technology. So much about what you've done is like you said, you're easily bored and curious about the next enabling platform technology, whatever it might be is. Is there anything out there today that you see as potentially filling that role and changing the landscape yet again? Peter: I believe on the one hand that traditional forms have enormous staying power, the movie, the TV show, the storytelling, gaming, people want to play games, people want to hear stories, people want to laugh, people want to be excited. So that part's not going to change along with it. The tools in which you can do those. And the delivery mechanisms will constantly change. Those are ongoing, and you better be relentless about thinking about, how do I use the tools to tell stories even more excitedly, or create games and more clearly? How do I use delivery technology to give people more choice and more control, better experience?I do think in terms of pie in the sky, I do think that God strike me dead for saying this. But web three interactivity, is a new vocabulary of expression. And that kind of interactivity, and I have no idea where it goes, but as it relates to both gaming and humans interacting with artificial and virtual environments, we're just about to throw the first pitch in the first inning, that people infinitely smarter than me, really want to but certainly fascinating. We're not trying to do web three, second investing, we're not a crypto investor or any of that stuff. We are looking at consumer businesses built on the blockchain, yes, we're invested in dapper labs, we're investments Edwin, investor in open sea, which are all our attempt to try and understand how consumers are going to interact in these new protocols.And that's, we believe our skill set. We believe we understand technology, and we're interested in technology, and we now use it as a enabling thing. But we really believe our expertise is consumers. And it's what Mike and Jesse and I wake up every morning, and think about it and that is hopefully what we offer to our entrepreneurs in our portfolio companies. These guys when we lent was focused on consumers, and we could try and help them maximize their reach and their interactions with consumers. Patrick: Peter, I've had an incredible amount of fun learning from you and from your team, say over the last year, as I've gotten to know the group. I've learned a huge amount of lessons. And I think so many of these things are media centric, but very broadly applicable in the world that we live in today. I really appreciate your time. I asked everybody the same traditional closing question, what is the kindest thing that anyone's ever done for you? Peter: My wife marrying me. Or probably just going out with me. From a business perspective, I've been insanely fortunate and been given remarkable opportunities by Rupert by Barry, by people, by show makers and entrepreneurs. The thing that sticks with my mind is, when I was 24 years old or something, I was a complete knucklehead. I was an English major, an English major at Berkeley in the early ‘70s. So I wasn't particularly career oriented. What I love to do is read books. So all I do is read books. And so I got out of college and said, “Well I guess I'd better go find a job. And I had no overwhelming ambition or direction. I saw, back to our conversation about the classifieds. I saw an ad in the newspaper for a publicity job at a book publisher. That sounds great. I like to read books, signed the paper. Great. I wanted a job as a publicist.And the president of the company this was Warner Books, was a publicity executive. I was a junior publicity person. President of company was a gentleman named Howard Kosminsky. He was probably 32 years old, so he's young guy, and this was mid ’70s. And I saw him in the hall after I've been introduced to this. “Hey, Peter baby what's happening, man?” And I'm like, “Well, not much, sir. What's happening with you?” “But what are you doing? What are you doing? Just let me give you some books to read.” And he gave me four or five books companies considering. By the way, there's a good lessons because I went home and read them that night. And I came back the next day, “Okay, I read these, here's what I thought about them.” He said, “That's great. That's great. Let me give you some more.”And I spent the next four or five months I would read six or eight books a week on the side beyond my regular chart for him and tell him what I thought about them. After six months there, he said, “What do you want to do?” And I said, “Well, I'd like to be an editor.” Which is all you ever want to do. If you're in book publishing, you want to be an editor. In journalism you want to be a journalist. If you're in movie business, you want to be a creative executive. And so I said, I want to be an editor and he said, “Okay, you're editor.” Just said, “Let me give you some books to read.” My second week on the job a guy he didn't know and gave me a chance to do that for three or four months and give me a chance to prove myself was an insane opportunity and an act of genuine kindness. Patrick: It's funny that just yesterday, someone went and listened to all 300 of these answers. And he's a data scientist, and categorized them. And the top two things were thanking a spouse and thanking someone that took a chance on them. So it's just so interesting to me, that that's what pops into people's minds. And it's probably a user's manual for paying it forward, find a great spouse and take bets on people, seems like a good policy. Peter: Absolutely it's a good policy. Find a good spouse is a no brainer, because it's hands down the most important. I met my wife when I was 25, you can meet someone that you want to spend 50 years with, change enormously is both an act of wild sound different luck, some kind of judgment in there somewhere and kindness on their part, but the flip side is the opportunity to pay it forward and take chances on people. That's the only thing that's interesting. The only thing that's interesting.By the way, it's the only way to manage one of these companies is to take chances on young people, because it goes back to that middle thing I was talking about earlier, which is the odds that you could hire a superstar with vast experience for any job or 1%, because you can't get them out of their existing job. The companies that work for generally aren't that stupid. Assume you can't do that. Then you get to two choices for filling a job, which is you can either hire someone who's not a superstar with lots of experience, or you can take a chance on someone on their way up. Every single time have to do the latter, because you're structuring for greatness. That's all you care about is greatness. You don't get greatness by hiring someone mediocre with a lot of experience. You get safety, but you don't get greatness. You get greatness by taking chances on people on their way up. And unfortunately, make mistakes and you got to get rid of mistakes. And then you got to really nurture the ones that are good. Patrick: What incredible closing thought. Peter, this has been so much fun. Thanks again for your time. Peter: I really enjoyed it, Patrick.

234,John Pfeffer - Adapt and Evolve,Introduction," Patrick: My guest today is entrepreneur and investor, John Pfeffer. John was a partner at private equity firm, KKR in the '00s, chairman of the leading French IT company, Groupe Allium in the nineties and now invests his own money through his private at family office, Pfeffer Capital. John is one of the smartest investors that I know and our conversation spans all John's experiences and ideas. We discussed the difference between value creation and value capture, why John has made such a big bet on one asset and why adaptation has become more important than ever. I hope you enjoy this conversation as much as I did with my friend John Pfeffer.",150
235,John Pfeffer - Adapt and Evolve,Formative Investing Experiences," Patrick: So John, this is going to be a wide ranging conversation. We had a really fun preparatory conversation last week and I've been looking forward to it ever since. Because of your interesting unique background. A completely open investing mandate, meaning you can invest in anything and do across the world, that understanding the lens through which you're coming at all this via some of your formative investing experiences would be a great place to start. Let's begin there. Maybe give the audience a thumbnail sketch of your background and maybe do so if you can, via what you view, looking back as of the formative investing experiences that formed your worldview and then formed your curiosity about the world. John: Yeah, I've lived in 10 countries, spent time in many more, but actually lived in 10 different countries, been in different industry. I was in the video industry in the 1980s, the tech industry in the nineties, then private equity in the '00s. And now we're building a retail business of all things. And so obviously living in different language bubbles, which tends to be what media information often structures around to some extent and perceptions of the same facts vary quite a lot when you do that. When you're consuming information in different languages and different countries and different perspectives and so forth, and then having changed networks successfully over my life. When you say changing industries, that's one thing. But also what that does mean is I'll decide to do something, to build a business in something, and I'll go build it and I'll build this network and I'll build a reputation and be somebody in that space. And then make the determination that it's time to sell or time to exit or it's time to move on, or that there's something more interesting or whatever, and do that and then go off and do it all over again. Create an entirely new network.And every time I do it, my prior network thinks I completely lost the plot. Usually for years and then maybe as much as 10 years later, say five to 10 years later, then they suddenly realized, oh wait, I was really onto something. And of course, the new network doesn't know who I am. There's no context. I don't easily fit apathetic type. Frankly, I don't understand why people put themselves in that position. I think it's the craziest thing that most people live their lives and have careers that becomes this massive path dependency on what really was probably an almost nearly completely random thing of like where their first job was out of university. Maybe you chose your first job. You clearly didn't choose where you were born. I never get why people anchor so much around the one thing in their life or just about, that they had zero control. But shifting away from that. My point about the changing networks is I have made these changes. And I think part of that's because I have very low need for status and security and social context. I'm happy to go and do my thing. When I was a teenager backpacking and going different places and all of that, I had this game. Walk by and sort of glance inside of somebody's window or whatever, wherever I was in the world and sort of go through this kind of thing and say, well, I could be that person. And then like, kind of play that out on what that would mean. And I'd walk by and one of the things I realized is let's say, population of eight billion, maybe only like a hundred thousand, maybe it's 500,000 people that I just really couldn't be. Physical reasons, or they're just so much smarter than I am or something else there's no way to replicate.And that sort of practice of doing that probably reflects and how I think is going to best in the fact that I try to be flexible and try to move on. And in fact, when I'm focused on pushing myself to improve, I think in terms of probabilities and updating probabilities, as new information comes, as opposed to certainties or whatever. When I think about how to improve, it's how do I update my probabilities faster and getting that balance right. I link that of course, to this trying to be flexible and willing to change worlds and change environments based on what's going on. If you think about the extremes, if you never update these dogmatic ideology and so forth. Okay, so that's nearly not good. The other extreme is everything that happens is updating your view of the world. You're always going to have a consensus view. I do think where I am is still on the margin, being faster to update will benefit me. Patrick: It almost sounds like I think of the fixed versus growth mindset is almost like this is a third category that's an open mindset or something where inertia is this incredibly powerful force in all of our lives. And one of the distinguishing features of you is your literal physical movement between countries, as part of your normal course of existing. You're certainly not fixed, but you're also not just purely growth on one trajectory. You can grow with inertia and what's distinguished you is you're building something it's not just in the wind, constantly changing your view, but you just have this very open lack of inertia. That's quite different than just about any investor that I've encountered. Is that a fair summary? John: I mean, let's put his way. I hope that I lack inertia, whether it's less than others is I'll let you judge, but I aspire to that. And for all kinds of reasons, one is just because it's fun to be honest and interesting. And the other one is that... Let's start from the premise that, a long time ago, even though it might have been exponential, the rate of change relative to human lifespan was incredibly slow. So the dominant strategy would've been to conform and collaborate. The kinds of things that you would select for would be obviously people who can work together, but also then tend to conform because it was really low payoff, high risk to suddenly go off and do something different if progress was relatively slow compared to human life path. Now, of course, we're in a part of the exponential, part of the curve where change is very, very fast and steep relative to human life span. And so it seems to me that the dominant survival strategy shifts to being adaptable and collaboration remains super important, always, but is more adaptable than conformist. And that might mean completely changing sectors. And there's clearly a huge successful people who say that like, Bill Gates who famously says, look, you want to do one thing and do it well and stick with it and all of that. And obviously, he's done better than I have.So fair enough. But the ability to adapt is the dominant strategy. And it's interesting that when I look at our portfolio and all the companies that we invest in, the funds that we invest in, the percentage of founders, managers, whatever, who are immigrants is insanely high. I mean, obviously that's an emergent thing. It's not something that we think about. But I think that one of the reasons probably somewhat emergent is that it kind of makes sense that people who've adapted or been forced to adapt or chosen to adapt, at some very profound and personal level are probably pretty good at creating new things and pretty well suited to what the world is like today and more and more every year, because it's just going to get faster and steeper.",1587
236,John Pfeffer - Adapt and Evolve,Building a Technology-Focused Portfolio," Patrick: As you think about the unique background that you've had then, leading up through to today. So you mentioned video then technology then private equity. Now you're building a supermarket chain in Europe as one of the several things that you and your family are working on, but a huge investor in technology. We're going to talk a little about cryptocurrency. Like you've had a remarkable set of experiences. What is your way of thinking through why technology and investing in technology dependent businesses or focused business is the sort of universal theme of the portfolio. Maybe the supermarket set to the side, we'll talk about that as well. But my understanding is the vast majority of the assets in your family's portfolio are technology focused in some way. So just talk us through this as a big idea, juxtapose against this 10 countries, five industries, seven networks, like you've done all this stuff, but you are, I think today focused on one big theme. So walk us through that. John: So I mentioned that I was in private equity, so I was a partner at KKR and then decided to do something new, but I just said, it's time to do something new, but what? And I had this intuition. Okay, so I've been in tech in the nineties in France. For 10 years, the intervening decade, I'd been in private equity training, leveraged buys and stuff like that. And which is fascinating, fascinating, and an amazing investment product. But again, I'm not vocational about anything. So I didn't do it because it was vocational, it was because I thought there was a great opportunity post dot com bubble in private equity because of falling interest rates and shift back to cashflow. And that turned out to be right. And so I came at it as just another product and another business. And after a decade it was like, now it's going to happen next? I need to kind of reframe. And part of reframing is one, it is to kind of force yourself to really step away from your prior frame, because your prior frame is going to tend to dominate. It's going to be very hard. The people you know, they're sort of like your gritter feed. I mean all kinds of stuff is sticky. And so you've got to decisively move away. At the same time say, well, what do I look at? So I had stumbled across, I'd read a New York Times article about this thing called the Singularity University that Ray Kurzweil and Peter Diamandis had put together. So this was in Q1 2011 and I said, you know what? I'm going to go do that. And it just happened coincidentally that the opening dinner of the week long executive program, the Singularity University was the evening of my last day at KKR.So I literally handed in my badge or whatever the heck it was and walk into this scene, university dinner and like the most binary kind of very clear leaving that. Now what's this. And it's been a week immersed in and understand exponential technologies and where they're heading and kind of how they relate and all of that. And rather interestingly, first time I heard about Bitcoin and so forth. And I just thought, this is right. The root is Wright's Law, which is the experience curve. This relationship between exponentially declining cost of production every time you double the cumulative units that you produce of something. And then Moore's law being a derivative of that, a lot of things are driven by Moore's law but also other examples of this. That's such a powerful thing that it overwhelms kind of anything else in terms of potential investment drivers. And of course, within that there's things like software, which again, you kind of see threads of that through a lot of different tech verticals just had this phenomenal economics, insane sort of zero marginal cost. And then to kind of realizing that we're actually at a unique time in human history. And it just seems to me that notwithstanding the fact that sure market values get out of whack and whether or not things are overvalued or undervalued currently, or the fact that hindsight, they were at least temporarily overvalued in the late nineties or whatever. This is with the overwhelming theme. The other thing is, by the way, there's a plurality, which is a given moment.You think that maybe there's too much of a consensus around that and valuations are too high. What do you do as an investor? You're going to invest in not tech, ingenuity doesn't seem exciting to me. I have this sort of cheat code, which is that we're just investing our funds and therefore we have an infinite investment horizon. When you stretch investment horizon to infinite or whatever, then a lot of things in investing collapse and become quite simple. But the long enough investment horizon risk is literally limited to just having to lead the game. You just worry about blowup. You just say, well, okay, well I don't want to be levered or at least not much. I don't want to go short. And then all of a sudden you sort of say, well, it's actually pretty easy. I want to be looking for things that maximize return because I don't really care about vol. And that also probably tends to push me towards being a bit of a convexity junkie. Patrick: Talk maybe through the experience since that first dinner at Singularity University through to today, what the experience has been like. Obviously, it's been an incredible run for, if you just look at simple indexes for technology companies. So if you've been a technology investor in the last 10 years, it's been really hard to not do really, really well. We're going to talk less about valuations, more about the fundamentals behind all of this stuff, because I just think it's more interesting, like you said, on an infinite horizon. What has it been like being a technology focused investor between that 2011 dinner and today in early 2022? Just again, to set the stage for the forward looking part of our conversation. Maybe we can introduce your early experience with crypto. I want to talk about comparing crypto to businesses and the business models of crypto and things like that. What has it felt like? What has been the felt experience to you of being a technology investor since that dinner? John: Easy and hard. Easy in the sense that the trends that I described a moment ago are such powerful tailwinds that some level just doing almost anything as you said in the last decade in that direction has paid off in absolute and relative terms. At the same time, it's hard and it's hard in the sense that it's very much of a power law. The best investor is going to have massively higher returns than the second best, let alone the 10th or the hundredth or the thousandth. So it's easy in the sense that it's easy to probably get up the initial part of the curve and it gets, and the curve gets really, really steep and it gets really, really, really hard to keep moving up the curve. But the rewards for that are extraordinary. Again, I'm an investor so it's my sport, I think in terms of returns and measure in that way, there's always room to get better at it. And there's a real reward for it. It just gets harder and harder. I think, I'll link that back to my comment earlier about I think of that a lot of that in terms of my ability to update my probabilities faster. When I look back at the last decade, I look back and say, well, good thing I focused in this way. But then I can also say, damn, that opportunity was sitting in front of me and I didn't take it. Or I was a bit slow.I should have been more focused on this or I should have gone even longer on this and that. And of course that's been a hindsight and careful beating yourself up over that stuff. But I can identify that where I feel I've left opportunities on the table, it was because I just didn't update fast enough. And that's, to me like the key thing for me to get a little bit higher up the curve is just training the muscle of updating faster. And then there's also just the fact that it's a lot to learn. You can't be an expert or anything because you have to pick your shots. And I think what that means is that for me, given that I'm not investing say a fund that is saying to investors, we're going to do X. I'm sort of deliberately diversifying because it's our money. I want to be doing things that maybe I can't be an expert in and so forth. They're sort of picking and saying, well, where do I want to be an expert? And where do I want to rely on others? And then how do I figure out the right people to rely on? And that of itself is a power law. Patrick: Does the who to rely on thing boil down to same attribute of adaptability today? If you're allocating as an LP to someone's fund is the primary feature in a team or a person that you're allocating to that ability to adapt to changing conditions. John: Let's put this way. Adaptability does tend to be a good feature of people that we trust in terms of managers of funds. And the reason I hesitate a little bit is there will be some cases where you'll naturally, especially in this space need and want real domain specialists like especially life sciences. You need somebody who's got a PhD because it's hard for that person to be oh and yes, I do this and oh and yes I do that. And then it's my job to who say, okay, at a portfolio level, I've got some people who I need to not be multi tool in their approach and their expertise is essential. I'm going to have to be the person who says, well, how do we wait to that? And so forth. Patrick: I'd love to understand the lens of good business and bad business and just really terms, because I think these are some concepts that we can then start to apply as we get more and more specific here to different interest areas of yours and places that you've put capital. Maybe just canonically describe what good business and bad business means to you against the backdrop of Wright's law and some of these other things that are true about the world. Just at a high level, define those two ideas for us. John: Typically, a good business has characteristics where it's growing, it benefits from sustainable various to entry, it probably not in a highly fragmented market, some degree of market concentration, it's not exposed to frequent technological disruption, it has comfortable margins. It's typically not very capital intensive and as a consequence has very good yields returns on capital. And so... Oh, and pricing power in whatever it's doing. The bad business would be the not of all of that. It would be well, that's not growing, there's technological disruption, quite thin margin, especially gross margins. I should have mentioned in the good businesses maybe there's some kind of self reinforcing effects like economies of scale or whatnot. And then again, bad business is typically capital intensive and those kinds of things. And so generally speaking, investing in good businesses better than investing in bad business. Obviously you can try to say, well, I'm going to invest in bad businesses, but buy them so cheaply. I've learned that that's a really hard way to make money and maybe an easy way to not make money. Patrick: How often is it clean? I mean, like how often do you see something? That's just like, oh, this is just one of those good businesses that tick all of those boxes versus has some of the bad features. John: There are things where you don't know, especially in the early tech and all of that where you don't know yet. There's like two things. One is the, is it or not this and this and where does it kind of score on these different dimensions? The other one is, how confident I am over time of where it will score? Patrick: How do you square the focus on technology with the fact that good businesses tend to not have technology disruption risk associated with them? It seems like this catch 22. You could pick your part attack, whether it's like database technology or something that for a long time, even still today, a lot of the same database companies dominate, but there's tons of new database technology companies coming out. How you think about that weird conundrum? John: There was a fashion, which I totally didn't ever understand, I still don't understand, in like the mid two thousands and the private equity industry, they were buying yellow pages businesses. We knew it was there and it was kind of like, really? And so, I think that the cases were it's just so blatantly obvious that there's real disruption risk that I think you just, you want to knock those out. Once you're in the world of saying, well, we have now competing technologies and maybe how long will this technology be a superior technology, at least you're in the right ballpark to begin with. And then, okay, you got to take views and there's risk. But I think in the absolute, at least that lens filters out a lot of things you don't want to invest in.",2895
237,John Pfeffer - Adapt and Evolve,An Investor's Perspective on Crypto," Patrick: I'd love to apply these cool ideas to crypto. So I think those that are in the audience that are familiar with some of your thinking, many might have read this very famous paper that you wrote in 2017, I think is when it came out. Which is sort of this institutional investor's lens or view on Bitcoin and crypto. And maybe you could outline what the key points of that paper were. I think you still believe a lot of those same things about that world, but one of the things I've enjoyed talking to you about in the past is applying this idea of business models and the best ""businesses"" that protocols themselves might represent. And that'll give us an excuse to talk about some of the specifics today. But before we do that, give us the sort of major points of that paper, which really made the rounds as one of the dominant thought pieces back in 2017. John: So I actually was reintroduced to Bitcoin in 2016 by my friend, Wences Casares. He explained to me in a few minutes, then I kind of got it and immediately said, great, this is a venture that I get it. We'll make this investment. And finally, I remember at the time, because when I called the office said, look, we're going to put X amount into Bitcoin. They were like, what? Look, this is a ready fire aim investment. We can always sell it. We can always sell half. We can always buy more. Let's just do it. And we'll see what happens. Then what happened it started going up and this was in early 2017, lot more buzz. Of course, it was already two years after you launched, but about Ethereum and smart contracts. And then you started having the ICOs and all of that. I said, wow, that's great. I bought some ETHE and did a bunch of other stuff. And this was all going up and I said, okay, well now I really need to understand it. I realized that I really couldn't just read the stuff that was being published on the internet. I couldn't take it at face value. Either it was poor quality or frankly, there was an agenda. That remains a constant issue, which is that anything, but especially in crypto, I would always say, whenever you read something, first filter is what does this person have to sell me? And then the answer is there's almost no content that isn't produced by someone who has something to sell. Whether it's a fund or token or their own equity or whatever. And so I went back to like I said, well, I'm going to read white papers and documentation and homestead documentation of Ethereum and all this kind of stuff. And so, okay. Thinking about it from first principles, from an economics perspective and coming at it from the view of when you're investing in technology and venture, because of the complexity, of course your thinking as an optimist.You got to be thinking in terms of this tech is going to work. Am I going to make money if I do this thing? If it works. Of course, think a little bit about maybe why it might not work, but you don't want to be stuck there. You're not a bond investor. And so came at it from the perspective of saying, let's assume all this works, where's value going to be captured? And there were two big central debates in 2017 that I focused a paper on, which were number one, this debt protocol thesis. And on the one hand saying that well, value will accrue to these utility tokens that are circulating a script in the protocols to do X with its run smart contracts or store files or whatever, on the one hand. And then the other hand there was this big debate about, on terms of the money side of things means of exchange. So store value... Three functions of money, store value, means of exchange and unit of account and kind of debate about how the importance of means of exchange. And that led to this block size war at Bitcoin and the forks and whatnot. And so a lot of my paper folks in that I said, let's take a technologically optimistic view, think about those two issues from an investor perspective and acknowledge the fact that there's other stuff. And I remember, around that time that we made an early investment in say, Dapper Labs. NFTs, of course that's a thing, but it's like a different thing. Let's set that aside in the paper and we can talk about it some more today. But those are the two key issues. And basically my thesis on the former was to say, well, the really key breakthrough, the Bitcoin made is obviously that you had built upon many, many prior attempts at creating digital money.And it managed for the first time to solve this problem of how do we create digital money without a trusted intermediary. And it did it through the Nakamoto consensus, which sort of solved this Byzantine general problem of coordination under uncertainty, but also when you can't trust all the participants in the network and it did in this incredible way. And all of a sudden we have digital money without an intermediary, and that's really, really profound and remains today, I think the most interesting and profound thing about this space. But the characteristic of something that is open source software, the good news is that opensource software is you can build primitive, you can solve something. And then it's there in the public domain for everyone and anyone to build on, to compose and to compound innovation on extremely fast. And that's like a really big deal and hugely exciting. And then you think about how that world will look and you think, well, we're going to make this great progress and we're going to have this open source software. And it's very light. There's going to be a lot of interoperability. You're going to have very fast innovation waves and new things being done, building on the last thing. But also there are some specific characteristics of all this stuff, which is you can fork it. And if you, for example, if there's too much rent capture, you can say, well, I actually want to fork it and have less rent capture. And at the time I sort of described this and a lot of people were like, ah, that's nonsense. And now we actually have a term for it, vampire forks, which is what SushiSwap did to Uniswap. And so these things have kind of not come to pass. Now we're seeing, well, we have this increasing interoperability, we have vampire forks, we have all these kinds of things happening.We have competition between alt layer ones and Ethereum, where the alt layer ones are making different choices in terms of the trade offs between decentralization security and performance. Some of which may not really scale, but right now they're useful. And I think it all shows the conclusion that I had at the time, which is what ETHE and so many of these things are, which is the circulating script on their protocols and the problem that that represents. But that broader thing means that it's actually obvious how great the value captures going to be. So Linux is like 99% of the world's software runs in Linux. I'm sure someone out there will correct me on the internet, but to my knowledge, I think really the value capture was like the red hat deal, like a $5 billion deal. And so it's not obvious giant open source software movement is going to be graded value capturing, but it's not just sort of a given. And so one of the things that I should mention, because it's actually the biggest one. Is there the other issue that I identified at the time or talked about, I shouldn't say I wasn't the one who identified it, but was that... And I'm using ETH as an example, but it's the most well known one is circulating currency. And what does that mean? Well, one of the things that really, really most annoys me is when people think of ETH like a share like equity, you own a share of the network. Listen, if you own ETH, that gives you no more ownership over the Ethereum network than owning US dollars gives you over the US economy. It's a circulating currency. It's not a share in the thing.Imagine that you and I were bullish about the US tech sector. We're two friends sitting in wherever the world, and we say, ""Oh, we're bullish in the US tech sector."" And you say, ""Well, I'm going to go buy a portfolio of FANG stocks."" And I say, ""I'm going to go buy some US dollars."" Some kind of very, very weird, loose way, that's not like completely disconnected. If the US tech sector really booms, somehow maybe the dollar... But it's extraordinarily weak. And why is that? Well, because circulating currency, it obeys Fisher's equation of exchange, which is that the money supply equals a GDP divided by the velocity, which turns over. And the trick of that is the more it changes hands... In fact, what happens is if velocity increases, then assuming a fixed money supply, then for a given amount of actual economic real activity, Q, then in order for the equation to still balance, you basically have to increase prices. If the denominator V is increasing, P has to increase commensurately, which means that you sort of have hyperinflation. Rising velocity is effectively... If it has nowhere else to escape, it's going to increase inflation, which of course is going to devalue that asset relative to other currencies. You'd have less inflation.And I pointed that out and said, ""Look, that means that unless people really hold this as a store of value, this asset, it's going to be treated effectively as working capital."" Because we do that. Companies, of course, do it. Individuals do it subconsciously. We don't just arbitrarily accumulate inventories of groceries and petrol. And we're doing this operations research equation of optimal inventory size in our heads. So either it's going to change the store value or it's going to be treated as working capital mean. When it's treated is working capital, the ability for velocity to go very, very high is incredible. This is my point I made in 2017. And therefore, you could have a very successful protocol in terms of the amount of economic activity being conducted on it, but very, very poor value capture through the native crypto asset, ETH for Ethereum. We're very much seeing this today, this combination of... First of all, moats are shallow and narrow. We've got a lot of competition. The big buzz in 2021 was about all these alternative L1s taking market share and competing with Ethereum. It's just interesting how easy it is to do that. Combined with interoperability in terms of value and state, meaning that we'll be able to update state across... State being just what the ledger says, people own, right? From one to the other. And with that, value will move. That asset will move from one to the other. It's going to be quite easy. You can understand why we would all be working in that direction. So that further undermines moats.We've got the velocity problem that we always had. We've got actual examples of vampire forks. And all of those things together, I think I was talking about happening at the time and now we're very much talked about. There's a really great podcast between Hasu and Su Zhu, Uncommon Core, that talked about this late last year. And they talked about this issue amongst other things. And I think that just means that, as I thought at the time, this whole protocol utility token as the great value capture thing thesis is really poor. And I think that it's going to be not great at value capture. It'd be a bunch of other stuff that is great. And then I said, ""Well, store value is great. It's logical that people would choose something that wins in store value terms, which is maybe it's really hard to seize or to sensor. It's maybe super secure and all of that."" And what's intriguing there is what I just described in terms of these L1 assets, I think, is describing a bad business. Bad business, not in the sense of technology. I'm actually hugely bullish about Ethereum. I'm hugely bullish about all of these things. I think they're going to scale. I'm a huge bull from a technology perspective. The question is as an investor, am I bull in owning those assets? And I think they're not great businesses to own as assets. There is however, this great business, which is store value money. It's not only a great business that it's going to capture a lot of value, but also it's actually quite simple. The tech risk isn't that high. So it's a good business in many respects. And Bitcoin is laser focused on that and does it extraordinarily well. There's a tremendous consensus around that fact. And no one's really competing with that.Rather, ironically, subsequent to my paper, it's kind of funny that the Ethereum community, I think must have internalized my paper quite deeply because they came up with EIP 1559, and now they're trying to shift this, which is great and interesting, and certainly an improvement. They made respects. But now they're sort of trying to shift the narrative from world computer to ultrasound money that creates this tension... By the way, they talk about, Hasu and Su Zhu in their podcast about this, what you end up with is this tension between what we're trying to be this world computer that everybody's going to use, which means we've got to be onboarding lots and lots of new users, but we're going to structure it in a way where there's a lot of rent captured by the old gangsters who owned it before, and we're going to call it ultrasound money. There's inherent conflict there that I think is actually risking for them to kind of fail at both, which would be a shame. So I know that was probably fairly dense, but on that issue of what I was talking about in 2017, I think it's all the more true today. And I think what's fascinating is that as an investor, Bitcoin has got this unique hold on this uniquely good business. And I think some other things that people are a little bit enamored with right now, I've thought and continued to think aren't really great businesses. And by the way, Bitcoin is going to scale in terms of means of exchange through Lightning Network. And those I think later too. And frankly, I think there's a good chance that stablecoins will be a big part of the means of exchange market and that's fine. I think that's a relatively low value market. Patrick: What are the other potentially good business models then in this space? So if I were to summarize back what you just said, Bitcoin is fundamentally different than the other layer ones. It's after a different job to be done. In stored value, there's really no competition for it. You and I have talked in the past about, is Bitcoin the right measure of opportunity costs just real large for investors? Should we be thinking about are other allocation decisions in Bitcoin return terms? Which is maybe something we can talk about here. Quite interesting. But that the others are of a different type entirely. I think you've told me before no one's investing in electricity, like the raw thing, or no one's investing in rapid features or big futures or something really. It's like a thing to earn a return on. But there are characteristics of that that are similar to some of these other layer ones that are ultimately like utilities for compute. What other good business models then are there? You don't just think Bitcoin is interesting. You mentioned Dapper Labs, which I think of as like the application layer, which is where all the Web 2 money was made was in the application layer, the FANG stocks themselves. So what else do you think is interesting in this space, generally speaking? John: I think people wrongly perceive me as a Bitcoin maximalist, which is not at all the case. Because I think by the way, there's different kinds of maximalism. One is first of all, in tech and the other one is in terms of your investment portfolio, which I separate. I'll repeat the fact that I think, for example, Ethereum's scaling roadmap is super exciting because ZK-Rollups and these kind of things are just super interesting, phenomenal things. I think by the way, they're rather obviously bad for the value of ETH. They're tremendous for the adoption of Ethereum. And by the way, just to be clear to everyone. When I say Ethereum, I'm talking about the protocol. When I say ETH, I'm talking about the asset. There's two different things. So it's unfortunate that it's a very tribal space. So I'm going to basically manage to piss off everybody by saying not only do I think that it's not just Bitcoin, but also I question whether the ETH or solar or whatever is going to be long term a great investment. I've literally pissed off the entire universe with that couple sentences, which doesn't make any sense. My base currency is Bitcoin in terms of how I think about how to measure wealth and that I see is tough because that means that the rest of our portfolio is kind of losing value. But I think it's a good thing to keep us honest.I think in terms of Bitcoin as a cost of capital, I think it's right. And that makes us selective in terms of what we do. I also think that what's changed about the world since 2017. In 2017, I think the universal question was, is it too risky to own Bitcoin? And I think now, is it too risky not to own Bitcoin? At least some. That's Bitcoin. Regarding other stuff, let me start by saying... So there's this term that's being used Web 3. There's a lot of really articulate, smart people out there to listen to or to read about on this. Matt Huang and Fred Armisen and Chris Dixon and Balaji Srinivasan and Naval Ravikant. I think you've interviewed some of them and those are all great resources to talk about all of that. So I would say rather than me trying to explain all of that, go to those podcasts. And I would say that from a technology perspective, again, I agree with the vast majority of the views that they express and a hundred percent excited about all of that. Maybe it's worth therefore move the conversation forward a bit rather than just repeat what other people are probably going to be able to express better. I do think it's interesting as an investor. As an investor, you can't just stop at the general thought of Web 3 is inevitable. Yes. Okay, fine. You only have to be making discrete investment decisions. So you have to do something with that. And making a discrete investment decision requires some thought as to, is this a good business or a bad business? If this thing is successful as a tech, will I make money. And you can donate all the money you want to Wikipedia, and we also should. If you're not, do it. But you're not going to get a financial return on that, no matter what happens. So there's a lot of things that have network effects that don't capture value. I talked about Linux where it's a little bit, but not much.So it is useful to therefore think about, well, is there a mechanism here for value capture? And I would just caveat, because I know there'll be a lot of commentary. I said in my paper, I thought that layer one smart contact protocol, native crypto assets could be worth tens or hundreds of billions. And I still think that's true. So by no means is that zero. The only problem is they're already worth hundreds of billions. So the return is maybe not great. And frankly, even if it's worth low single digit trillions, the question is it really worth the risk? That's my main question. But moving on from that, there's so many other things that are interesting. I'll touch on a few. I don't get the controversy around non fungible tokens, to be honest. I mean, discreet physical objects have value, subjective and objective value. Why is it therefore that troubling for many that discreet digital objects should have value or might have value, subjective or objective? I think it's obvious that they can and should. One thing might be at the cost. Another thing might be a collectible spoon, but fine. It's not a philosophical thing. Now that's a little bit like if we were sitting here talking about investing in equities and I said, ""By the way, I'm really into Basquiat."" Well, okay. That's like a totally different pursuit, being an art collector. There are platforms like companies and business like Dapper OpenSea and so forth. But there's a lot more than that. I'll just call this optimism, be living more and more in our lives in the digital realm. The whole notion of you need digital objects is going to be more and more important in terms of all kinds of things and how we present ourselves and status and all kinds of other things.Right now, let's say you collect watches. Okay, well, you got your watch collection. It kind of sits there and you got to wind them, but otherwise it's a dead asset. Whatever the NFT equivalent is, well, you can... And more and more, will be able to state that asset to borrow against it. You'll be able to fractionalize it. And you can do it in ways where, because all this is programmable, wouldn't have been practical before. Because like before, okay, you could have on paper said, ""I'm going to sell 1/100th shares of my Basquiat."" And people may or may not buy it and you're going to have paper moving around to do that. And what does that really mean? In this environment, I mean, there's a really series of papers that Dave White at Paradigm wrote about Martingale shares where he describes the market mechanism where effectively... And I'll put it in my terms. You can fractionalize an asset where the price at which minority stakes should trade won't necessarily include a minority discount. And it's actually something that would be incredibly problematic to implement in traditional financial markets. We know that the price of one Apple share is very different from 51% of Apple shares. There's a control premium. There's all kinds of reasons why that's kind of hard to get away from.But once you're dealing with primely fractionalized assets, you can implement market structures, which maybe only existed in academia before, which changed things in a very fundamental way. And we haven't even begun to see those things manifest. And then of course, from there, you can bridge into things like gaming where it's kind of obvious that you need digital assets are linked to that. I'm not a gamer. So I always had a big disadvantage in some sense. I think another podcast with someone on gaming economics and so forth would be a good listen for just reference here. But we've had these successive gaming platforms, whatever. And I can't remember the order, but it's like we had the stuff in the arcade. The big things in the arcades, and then you had those PCs and then consoles or consoles and PCs. And then mobile came about. Really, it was something like Angry Birds that suddenly made everyone get what was unique about that new platform, which was the touch screen and how that really was super engaging for gamers. And then exploiting that and then creating a new economic model for gaming, which wasn't just, ""Here, go spend 40 Euro or whatever to buy this cartridge or this game or this download."" But rather, you download it free and then you're going to pay extras in the freemium models and all of that. And it was hugely powerful. None of that's been figured out yet, I think. So you've got huge successes, but still, I think we haven't yet figured out what is uniquely compelling from a gamer perspective or from a player perspective thing about this. And maybe it's the economic incentives of ownership and all of that, but who knows? Maybe there's something else. But then also kind of what are the economic models that will really stick? Sort of seems to be obvious that's going to be huge.I talked about why things that function as a circulating script, I don't think are great at value capture, but if you have a token that is actually a claim on a fee stream, that is both obviously valuable and able to be valued. You can actually just project forward a set of fees based on your assumptions and then discount those back and have a view on value. And it's not zero. Now you might say, ""Yes, but maybe it's not that strong. And I'm going to ding my projections because of vampire forks."" Maybe my discount of the value of Uniswap is somehow affected by the fact that SushiSwap is possible. And then use that as just an example of something that could happen. Fine, but it's not controversial. So there should be valuable things in this space. Seems obvious, but it may go beyond that. I'm going to come back to some of the stuff I said about financialization of NFTs here. The build out of these primitives in defi and composing these things into new things over time, I think is going to massively increase capital efficiency in the economy. Sam Bankman-Freed, had a blog post about how already in the centralized finance world of FTX, they use sort of an on chain architecture in a way that increases capital efficiency. But the potential for these primitive to be assembled and composed and built in a way that's going to compound very rapidly in terms of innovation and the potential to implement new market mechanisms... I mentioned in NFTs, but maybe it's not just NFTs. Maybe it's all kinds of assets where now we're having Martingale shares. We eliminated minority discounts and all these other things. It's hugely potentially powerful. So my gut feeling is we can't even kind of anticipate how all of that will create value. And then there will be things within that where there'll be some value capture that will be perhaps compromised to some extent by the open source. But there'll be some that will just be real value captured.Another thing I think is super interesting and obviously the thing that I'm mostly focused on is they do think... Bitcoin owns the stuff in stored value space, but there's also a lot happening in terms of becoming a better means of exchange through Lightning Network. And that will have more and more uses and applications. I think that's an interesting area to focus on, and that's not just buying Bitcoin, that's investing in venture capital and stuff like that. I've talked a little bit about blockchain scaling and that's super exciting. Compromising on centralization and other things. I think there's a good debate out there that others have had that more articulately than I could explain here about whether scaling will come from just lots of layer ones that may or may not be that centralized versus layer two scaling through things like ZK-Rollups. Regardless, it's going to happen and it's very interesting and there'll be some things to do and investing in venture capital and those spaces interesting. We alluded to the joint stock company and limited partnerships and so forth as these forms of organization. Well, there's a new one, which is the DAO, right? The Decentralized Autonomous Organization. And it's a little bit like saying, ""Oh, we've just invented the joint stock company."" You can't just invest in that. It's going to enable a bunch of stuff, some of which will be interesting in investing and some of it won't. There'll maybe be a whole industry of support for that new economic organizational structure, which is interesting. So you can invest in companies or ventures or protocols that will provide that support. You may invest in specific DAOs because what they're doing is interesting and others that you won't.But I think there's an interesting point there, which is in my mind... In the same way we haven't yet figured out in my mind, what's compelling about blockchain gaming from the gamer's perspective, I don't know that we've really figured out what's uniquely compelling about DAOs, what they're really good for. So that'd be interesting to see what it is and you want to be on top of all of that. That's a ramble on the different things that I personally think are super interesting, including Bitcoin, which is the bedrock of a portfolio in my view. And then Bitcoin becoming more and more of a means of exchange through layer two. But then a bunch of other things that I think are hugely interesting in where there will be value capture. Securities tokens, to me, I think that the controversy may just be, well, you always need to be a little bit skeptical when you're putting something in a blockchain that is actually in the physical world at the same time because you're going through a lot of hoops to be in this decentralized digital world, but then you've got to go back through a court system or something to enforce in the real world and going back into the need for an intermediary. So I think that it's always something to keep in the back of your mind. Having said that, again, you could see not only some back office improvements, which I think is of all of the stuff we've talked about, not that interesting but they're there, of using this tech for whatever trading shares in a company or in a piece of real estate or whatever. But I think what may be more interesting is, again, back to what about putting some of these new market mechanisms that have only existed in academia to work?",6296
238,John Pfeffer - Adapt and Evolve,Sources of Capital Efficiency and Value Creation," Patrick: Why would that be good? Thinking about capital efficiency itself. I think everyone listening would assume, oh, more capital efficient equals better kind of through history. I'd love to just talk about capital. We've talked before about, do we want to be a buyer or a seller of capital itself? How has capital changed? Is it the formation of capital? The classic funding the ship in the early days, and that's where carried interest came from and the LLC? Is capital formation fundamentally what's valuable, or is using less capital, which I think of as capital efficiency for the same outcome, more valuable? Why is this good? John: Capital efficiency is good simply because assuming the stock of capital is finite, using it more efficiently is good, right? And of course, capital grows over time. But in any given instant, there is X capital and therefore you want to be using it efficiently. Flip it around, and you don't want to be using it inefficiently. And we do. Traditional finance markets are egregiously inefficient with settlement periods and the way it deals with risk and margin calls and loan to value and all these different things, which in a programmable environment, you can push the limits so massively and these things become at some point kind of logarithmic. So the benefit from going from 98 to 99% efficiency, it can be similar to going from 80 to 90. So back to these power law effects, even the incremental efficiency gains, I think will be quite profound. So why is capital efficiency good? Well, what are we going to do with this capital? Well, we're going to make stuff. We're going to invent stuff. Humanity will progress. We're going to be able to invest more in research and development and capital stocks and infrastructure and doing things that today we can't even... And obviously I'm getting way ahead of myself, but I'm taking it to kind of an extreme, because it's useful sometimes to frame things in extreme. And you see it already in terms of the amount of capital it took for the first moonshot versus what it takes Elon Musk today to get a person into space.There was a while I was kind of worried and I came out of the singularity universe kind of thinking, ""Well, gee, if this abundance thesis plays out, then capital is suddenly... Capital is only valuable because it's scarce. So if we have abundance, then there's no more scarcity. Capital is worthless."" That's kind of bad for me because I've got some capital. And I was worried about that. Literally. It's funny things to worry about. And then I realized, you know what? We will always come up with new applications for whatever capital stock we have. And that will be the thing that will set the return on capital. There's no end to that, I think. This is, by the way, another interesting topic we might want to touch on is speculating a little bit on if all this stuff plays out, what does it mean for value and equity markets and other stuff? So it'll be value shifts, massive value shifts. And one thing is worth is another thing, but also who owns what stuff and who captures value? There's going to be huge, massive shifts and that's going to be pretty... Wow. But we'll always have uses for capital. Patrick: I'm going to save my buyer versus seller of capital question for a little bit after because I don't want to lose this thread of so much of what we talk about is what gets enabled faster velocity, more efficiency, more use cases that skeuomorphic, to use Chris Dixon's term, the Angry Birds of the future. Things we couldn't do before that we can do now. That's all super interesting and exciting. What about that impact on, for those that never own crypto and say to themselves for some reason, legally, let's say they're not allowed to own crypto. So they're like, ""Well, what does this matter to me?"" I think the way it matters most is, well, if you own the S&P, you own banks, you own media companies, you own all these other stuff. So how do you think about that shift of value, the ways in which all of this, even if you're not exposed to it as an investor could still very much affect your investing returns? John: I'll start by saying I think this tech, in terms of value creation potential, is the same order of magnitude as the internet itself. And maybe it's even more or maybe it happens faster because it's even more composable and the bedrock of the internet is open source, but a lot of what's built on it isn't. This will be maybe much more university open source and as a consequence, will compound faster and even better. Maybe it's even creating more value. But let's say order of magnitude similar. Again, because as of all the characteristics I've talked about, maybe by value creation, I'm talking about all surplus in microeconomic terms, including consumer producer surplus. This is all surplus. Maybe for the reasons I've cited, it's an order of magnitude worse than the internet at capturing value. I think there's an argument for that. But then an interesting thing... Again, the third leg of this little framework is it perhaps takes an order of magnitude yet less resource to create that value. So because of this composability and the compounding of open source, the amount of developer hours it takes to create Uniswap versus what it took to create some of the big Web 2, it's insane because they're building on so many different open source components and so forth.So interestingly, that would imply that returns are an order of magnitude higher, not withstanding the worst value capture. But I think it's directionally useful to think about. Now, that's just in terms of aggregate value, thinking about value creation and capture and returns. But another question is there's going to be a massive shift in who it accrues to. So if you kind of think about who are the constituents you've got, well, investors and you've got employees, developers, entrepreneurs, and you've got users. This tech is... if you index to a hundred, it's rather obviously going to be giving a lot more value to users than legacy tech did. Probably more value to developers. They're obviously investors as well. And then investors probably less at some level. That would make sense. Now, maybe that's not been quite what's happened to date, but you would think that that would be the outcome of something where it's open source and it's interoperable and it's forcable and all this kind of stuff. So 0.1 is again that maybe captures less, but returns are higher because resource is less. And 0.2 is distribution across those three constituencies, I think is going to be different and much more towards users than legacy.I think another interesting observation is that... Let's say as a public markets investor, you're going to really struggle to benefit from this. In fact, you're going to be on the receiving end of a heck of a lot of disruption. There was a newsletter... I've been thinking about this for a while. I saw a newsletter from Hedge Fund at Bishopsgate that has been historically quite skeptical in crypto. And they were basically making the point this is really, really bad for equity as a whole. And I nuanced that by saying that I think it's bad for public equity perhaps in the aggregate. Because the way we sort of express ourselves is we own a bunch of Bitcoin and then we do a lot of crypto VC. So I think that there will be pre-orders of magnitude tiering that I said less resource to create a lot of value. You can capture less. I think crypto VC is a great way to capture that, but the public market investor is going to be in the wrong side of a lot of that potentially. And it'll vary by sector. Patrick: And the way this manifests, just give maybe one example of this and maybe it's banking or something like that, or there's huge economic equity value today, but this technology could fundamentally change where that resides. Do you think that banking is the best example? Is media the best? What are the most obvious ones to you? John: Well, let's go through each one, and this is like 3:00 AM dorm room level of massively speculating. We talked about DeFi and how excited I was about what it could mean in terms of just capital efficiency in the economy and so forth. So what that means for just economic growth is potentially tremendous. Gains in capital efficiency will just have cascading effects across the entire economy. Let's differentiate. When we talk about where there's going to be the biggest side effects of those kind of markets, lending, brokerage, investment services, it'll be massively expansionary because this will be hugely beneficial at the macro level of the capital efficiency. It's very expansion in terms of the financialization of everything. I was talking earlier, I was saying, if you have a... Again, if you collect watches, it's just a dead asset. If you collect crypto punks, you can stake them and fractionalize them and financialize them. And also the fact that we're shifting from markets that are open, whatever seven hours a day, whatever it is, 4.6 days a week, taking out holidays or whatever to markets which are 24/7, 365. That actually is not trivial in terms of what it means to macro efficiency. So I think that it's going to expand the pie insanely and will have huge macro benefits for economies globally, but it's going to be really bad for the shares of traditional finance businesses. And there'll be some equity value captured by, say a Coinbase, but I don't think it'll come anywhere close to the equity value destroyed. It'll be overall a huge net win, but you're going to really struggle to be not a net loser expressing yourself through public equity. First of all, you really want to just be a user. You just want to be a member of the economy. And as an investor, you're going to have to invest in venture level equity, perhaps some tokens, which will capture value for some of the mechanisms I've talked about earlier, fee capture or whatever, and investing early enough that you're going to make money, not withstanding the relatively poor value capture. I'll give an analogy there.It's like I suspect that the seed round investors in pets.com did pretty well provided that they sold timely. The fact that that was a terrible long-term value capture, if they were early enough, they probably did pretty well, and I think there's a lot of that. And they'll be more generous. Things that just go bust, things that maybe were overvalued and never fully recovered, that if you were a seed round investor, that was still okay. You talk about media. So let's put that maybe into gaming and other media. Gaming, I think it's unclear. It really depends on how compelling it is as a gaming experience in the end and what economic model develops. I think it's just too early to tell. There's certainly a potential for it to be bigger and greater, but it's still, in my mind, too early to tell. I'd be bullish. I'd be optimistic it'd be bigger and bigger, but that's going to depend on somebody figuring it out. Social media impact is also unclear. I think it's first order destructive for equity, but maybe new economic models that are created which are net additive. Maybe this one's a little bit tougher to guess. But then I want to come back to something you alluded to a minute ago, which is the critics and skeuomorphic or non-skeumorphic point, which is excellent, in the same way that Twitter didn't replace other forms of news. Maybe it took market share, maybe whatever, but it grew the market.Uber didn't completely exterminate hail taxis, or even driving your own car. And I think it's wrong for us to just think in terms of Web3 being, there's going to be things that will replace a Web2 equivalent. My guess is that they'll be additive. And also I think the most interesting things are things that we can't even yet really imagine. In the late '90s, even if you quote, got the internet and except I'm sure for some very smart people, most smart-ish people like me would've said, ""Well, okay, great. I can read a newspaper online. I can maybe order a book if I keep trying to check out until finally they take my credit card number and all of that."" And I would've said those things would get better. I don't know that I could have imagined Uber because we didn't have mobile yet. We didn't have the bandwidth yet. We didn't have mapping, all these different prior innovations that were required. And the same is going to happen here, where we need scalable blockchains. We need to figure out some economic questions and so forth that will suddenly lead to things that are going to be non-skeumorphic innovations, which will probably be the most valuable. And again, when I say most valuable within, not Bitcoin... I mean, I want to be careful because I'm talking about a lot of stuff, but always want to come back to the fact that I think that the native money of the internet is the no-brainer bedrock underlying all of this, but I'm talking about all the other stuff.",2877
239,John Pfeffer - Adapt and Evolve,Breaking Down the Protocol Layer," Patrick: So John, we've talked a lot about the different, interesting angles on investing in versus being a believer in the technology of non-Bitcoin Layer-1s. But I'd love to just dive, with a couple interesting ideas, a little bit deeper to put a finer point on some of the concepts. And the first is this idea of sort of crypto fading into the background. Like so many of the protocols that fuel the internet that 99.9% of people... No one's ever heard of SMTP, or I guess HTTP everyone's heard of, but usually the history is that protocols are abstracted away. No one cares. I'd love to hear your thoughts first on whether that is going to happen in crypto as well. John: Whenever we make an analogy to say the .com bubble and all of that, you got to be careful that you don't overweight analogies because things are different. Nevertheless, I think here, there is an interesting reference, which is, remember back in the late '90s, we literally talked about .coms. We talked about, are you investing in .coms, .com stocks, or whatever. And even that term references the fact that the common characteristic of these businesses or whatever was that they had a domain name and it ended in .com. That was like the foreground. The destination was .com. Today. When's the last time you heard somebody talk about, do you invest in the internet? Are you investing in internet businesses? Well, we don't, because it's everywhere. It's embedded in everything and okay, there are businesses which live completely on the internet. We still don't talk about them as internet businesses. We talk about a social media business or a search business or maps business or a payments business or e-commerce business or whatever. And then there's the reality, which is the internet is a part of every business to differing degrees. Not because that happened, do I think that's going to happen here, but I think that there are lots of reasons to believe that a similar thing is going to happen where crypto today is seen as a destination. There's a shift underway that I think will ultimately go as far, if not further, of crypto being the background. It's hard to believe... Let's assume this tech has all this tremendous success, which I believe it will have, and that we're going to have billions of users, the billions of users of Web3 or whatever we want to call it spending their days effectively day trading some huge number of crypto assets and taking speculative positions in all these different crypto assets.One is a thing to do, but also as part of getting whatever it is that they want to get done, done. And that doesn't seem, first of all, very attractive. It'd be a huge ask on users, and it doesn't seem very likely. It seems much more likely that what will happen is a couple of things. One is, everything that makes all this work is probably going to fade into some kind of background of bots, where we'll have tools that we use to manage our whatever it is that we're trying to get done. And we'll say, I don't know, ""I need to do X. I need to..."" whatever it is. ""I've got my collection of whatevers, and I want to do X and Y,"" or, ""I need to store some files or whatever,"" and just ask the bot to do it. And the bot will go out and figure out how to best execute probably across multiple blockchains, each of which is tuning to optimize for different needs that will be interoperable that will be compatible to greater or lesser degrees and all of that. Will that bot be programmed to HODL, to speculate on crypto assets or say, ""Yeah, I'm going to do some kind of AI positional trading."" No, it's going to be programmed to execute at lowest cost and for capital efficiency. And the lowest cost will be, how much does it actually cost to get my operation done? But capital efficiency is coming back to this notion of, if you're not a dominant store of value, you're working capital, meaning companies, entities. People think of our wealth and store it in some thing, in a thing, and measure it in that way, and there's a bunch of other stuff that we need and use that we treat as working capital, and we're optimizing inventories, and we're really only holding as much as we need in order to write out replenishment delays, standard deviations of risk around replenishment and all this stuff intuitively. That's actually what the operations research formula will tell you, but that's really what we're doing.And those bots will be programed for that. And what that's going to do is drive anything of that backbone, infrastructure nature, I think is going to be managed in the background by software that's probably going to be programmed for capital efficiency, and that's just going to drive even more towards this notion of these things being working capital which results in high velocity, which is obviously problematic for anything that function is a circulating script, as many of these things do. Again, I'm not talking about things that actually have a claim on a cash flow. I'm not talking about unique digital assets that may have collector value or other some kind of value. I'm not talking about things that aren't that, but a lot of these Layer-1s are. People will say, ""Yeah, but wait a minute. There's staking, and there's EIP1559 and burning."" And that's all true. And that was clearly a step in the right direction towards trying to reduce velocity. But I still think that whether it's enough or not remains to be seen. I do think this is probably the right direction, so I don't dismiss it. I would say ,though, there's this conflict... Either you want to be the most efficient decentralized software backbone for the global economy and as such, be cheap and high performing in order to constantly recruit new users and new use cases, or you want to extract rents in order to reward existing holders of the currency, which is this ultrasound money narrative that's cropped up in the ethereum community. And I think those things are hard to do at once. In fact, I think they're contradictory. And so I'm not convinced.And I would also just add the fact that people are excited about it becoming a fixed income instrument. It's fine, but you still have to ask, what's the rate of return versus the risk of holding? Remember that the rate of return is being generated, not because the eth is being invested in productive things, and those productive products are paying interest, but rather it's that the non-stakers are bearing the inflation generated to reward the stakers. So it's like squeezing a balloon. You're basically pushing the velocity on part of the money supply as you move it away from another part of the money supply. But the other thing is, is that you could offer me an interest rate of whatever, 3% in Argentine pesos, I probably still wouldn't put my savings in Argentine pesos, meaning not necessarily, no.So I think it's a step in the right direction. I'm not convinced that it's, by itself, enough. In any event, we're going to have... Again this fades into the background. Bots are going to be optimizing, moving across multiple chains, and it's going to be exceedingly easy to resist rent capture by these things. I'll make a couple other points on this topic. One is, what I've just said has been the opposite of correct over the last year, meaning we've seen a huge performance in Layer-1 crypto assets, and it's very much the narrative of the moment. And let it be clear that this view is not at all what we're seeing happen right now. It's a view that might be true in the future. And all I'm doing is kind of explaining what would be the drivers of that, and why I think that's the case, and why I struggle to see the opposite. So I'm very much accepting the obvious criticism, which is ""Yeah, but John, you just like..."" Let's see over the longer term and obviously investors have different time horizons. So if you're a short term horizon investor, listening to what I've just said would've been highly self defeating. If you're a longer term investor, maybe it's right. And I would give you an interesting... Again, I'm going to risk analogy here. But reminds me a bit of, we think about these kinds of comical egregious cases, boo.com and pets.com, and if you actually remember the big giant internet darling stocks, the ones that really, really were big market cap in crazy multiples were, first of all, things like Deutsche Telekom, Allyance, Cisco, Intel. And in particular, there was a subset which was telecom stocks. Telecom stocks were hugely popular, and you would've been derided for questioning the obviousness of the fact that, well, all this internet traffic is going to have to travel over pipes. They own the pipes. So there's going to be this massive exponentially growing demand for bandwidth, and as a consequence, there's no multiple too high for valuing Deutsche Telekom. But in fact, literally, if you had come out in 1998 or 1999 and said, ""That's a bad thesis,"" you'd be laughed at. But on the other hand, they were sort of knowably bad businesses.So let's take in telecom. It's like, yeah, they own pipes, but really what is it? It's a highly capital intensive commoditized business subject to wave upon wave of technology advances and prone to cyclicality because of overbuilding. And what ended up happening was, anyone was old enough to remember was, the internet bubble included a telecom bubble, and then it crashed, and a lot of those companies went bankrupt. So basically the debt holders ended up owning this and was cooking dark fiber that ultimately was lit, and it ended up having some value, but not for equity holders. And then take Deutsche Telekom, which again, was this huge darling, it's like trading still 78% below its .com peak. And it was a pretty intuitive thesis. Well, of course, let's own the pipes, but it's very analogous to, well, let's own the Layer-1 that all of this is going to be built on. And the reasons are different. So the other one was because of capital intensity and simplicity and all of that, whereas this is because it's a circulating script and it's forkable and copyable and the moats are shallow. So it's a different set of drivers, and therefore could get a different outcome. But nevertheless, there's a whole series of reasons to believe similarly to the telecom business, which weren't great businesses, and these aren't great businesses. I've been looking back to 2017 at the time eth was overvalued; the bitcoin, that was a good trade. Last 12 months, both Eth and these other Layer-1s have performed extraordinarily well. I'm talking about 10 years hence, and I have no idea what's going to happen over the next months or even a couple of years. But I would have that in the back of my mind, is this Deutsche Telekom? Patrick: What piece of information do you think would most upend this view of the world for you? John: I think that there's a consensus now compared to 2017. And I don't think anyone would disagree that any of these circulating currency type assets to have value, they need to be a store of value. I think everybody's accepted that. So the debate is around what becomes that store of value and whether there might be more than one and the relative size. I think now that's not really controversial. People have to hold onto it, and velocity has to go down for this to work. So that's why ethereum moving to proof of stake is trying to bring velocity down. Then fee burning is trying to create incentives for holding the currency. It's because they're directly addressing that. So I think that's, I believe, consensus now. It wasn't perhaps when I wrote my paper. And then the question is, okay, but what makes it a store of value? So I'm saying that... Well, I'm sort of assuming people are rational, and that they're going to choose store value based on the same criteria that I would choose store value, which is, I want to have the thing with the most security. So bitcoin's hash rate, which is the measure of the security of the network is crazy orders of magnitude greater than anything else. It's the most decentralized. It's stable as a protocol. So you know what the monetary policy is but also in other respects, it's stable. So your tech risk is extraordinarily low on a relative and absolute basis. Then these are the things that I think would make an attractive store value relative to things that would not follow that.There could be a consensus that forms around something else being a store value. And in that regard, money is a little bit of a meme in that there are some objective reasons why gold has been money for so long, but it is. Could it have been platinum? I guess. It's kind of like we use platinum in catalytic converters, and gold as money. I mean, there's a bit of monetary premium, but it's not the thing. Why is that? Well, there's probably a parallel universe somewhere where that might have happened. And in the same way, there's probably somewhere in the multiverse, a parallel universe, where ether, another Layer-1, there's a consensus formed around it being, not withstanding the arguments that I think make Bitcoin more attractive, seen as the store value. It's not impossible. Look, there's also somewhere in the multiverse, there's one where it was Deutsche coin. What I do with that as an investor, I don't know. I think you can hedge. So you could say, ""Well, I'm going to own a bit of both."" I think you have to know that, though, there are all these other arguments as to why it might not be a great long-term hold, or you just see it as a part of your overall portfolio. I don't think that would be the main reason. The main reason would just be that, you know what? Everybody just kind of says, eth is the store of value and don't care about the fact that it has a changing in constant money supply and don't care about the fact that it's fairly centralized and don't care about the fact that proof of stake is a very different kind of security than proof of work. Don't care about the fact that the protocol is changing frequently. There's a lot of tech risk. It's possible. Not completely unreasonable. I have my view, and so me explaining it is going to sound a bit one-sided, but I do think that reasonable people could come to a different view. And that would be the main reason why I think I could turn out to have made the wrong bet on which is going to be the store of value.",3211
240,John Pfeffer - Adapt and Evolve,Making a Concentrated Bet on Bitcoin," Patrick: I love the prompt to the audience to think about it in equity terms, like a good company does not necessarily make a good investment. There can be a price which destroys any return. I think the idea that something which is incredibly dominant and useful, and a key utility in the world... Deutsche Telekom 80% below 2000 peak... can also not be a good investment. We don't know what's going to happen, but it's just a really, I think, interesting and important idea that's very against the current narrative that activity on a blockchain or demand for state on a blockchain is some sort of proxy for potential return. And I think people just want to be responsible and separate those two ideas when making investment decisions. I just think that's super neat. Very often, I love learning. I love talking about all these things, but there's often nothing better than simply asking someone what's in their portfolio. And you and I have talked before and today, I think it won't surprise people to learn that 85% of your crypto portfolio is bitcoin. The remainder is crypto VC, which we've talked about already. Maybe just lay out there for us in an absolute simple sense the reasons behind such an obvious large bet on a single asset in a space that's full of assets. John: There are different ways to come at this space. Some people who come at it ideologically. There's a lot of reasons why that is appealing and important. There are people who come at it purely from an investing perspective. I do come at it as an investor, which doesn't mean I'm not sensitive to some of the super important non-financial implications, but I'm going to lead with an investing answer and then maybe talk about the rest because I do think it's important. Look as an investor, I think that bitcoin is just this incredible, no-brainer investment. There will be a money of the internet. There will be a digital store of value and means of exchange and so forth. And that is going to be super valuable. That's fairly intuitive. And bitcoin has correctly identified the highest value piece of the function of money, which is store value and really nailed it and doesn't really face, in my opinion, real competition for that function. And it has the added benefit of being fairly simple from a technical perspective. There's already product market fit. You don't have to believe that bitcoin is going to jump through a whole bunch of further technical hoops to get there. And so you've got this thing that is going to happen. If it happens, it will be valuable. And there's this thing that's doing it really well that already has product market fit that is not really facing tremendous competition. That feels to me like just a no-brainer investment and something that you want to be significantly exposed to, and a great bedrock on the one hand. So that's sort of category one and why it's so heavily weighted.Now, interestingly, it is also true that in, let's say, 10 years forward, it's likely that bitcoin will be actually a smaller part of our portfolio, whether it turns out that bitcoin succeeded or bitcoin failed. I mean, if bitcoin failed, it's obvious why. We'll lose a lot of money, but if it succeeds... Right now, it's a risk asset because it's a venture project that aspires to be a more stable store value. And what's exciting about it is participating in that monetization. But if it succeeds, at some point it will become a more stable store value. It will go up relative to the growth of the economy and the kinds of things that you think of it as store value at which point progressively, it makes sense to shift perhaps into higher returning assets. If you look back 15 years ago, I didn't have this proportion of assets of a total asset sitting in, say, gold, because why would you? It's fine, but it's either not in your portfolio or a smaller part, because you're doing a bunch of other stuff. Same thing will happen here. And what we're doing in that regard is incrementally investing in others. Bitcoin cost of capital is high, but there are things that happen, and when they do, that's a legitimate reason to sell bitcoin as opposed to say at target price.But crypto VC is also a part of that. That's sort of this other bucket that I talked about, is the fact that there will be a lot of other stuff built. Talking about valuation is tough, but at least if you're investing in the VC stage, you're investing at the lowest... Your values are lower than if you're investing after the VCs. And so, given that there will be stuff of value built, and that includes, by the way, Layer-1s, which I don't think should be zero value. I'm just saying. I'm not sure I would buy them in the liquid market today. And all of the stuff I said earlier about why they're not great investments, that's very different from saying, would I be invested in the VC that might invest very early in one of those protocols, as well as all the things we talked about, where there's a claim on fees or unique digital assets or dows or all these other kinds of fantastic technologies. If you get early enough exposure at low enough values, that's great. And so we have an allocation to that, and that will grow over time, meaning on a relative basis, I think that will slowly shift. What's missing, of course, is that middle ground of other liquid assets, alternatives. Part of that's because of what I said is, I think that there's a lot of arguments as to why some of those things won't be as good a business to be invested in as people may currently think. Other things may be good businesses, and then there's question of relative valuation. It's exponentially riskier because there's a lot more uncertainty compared to, say, owning bitcoin, a lot more uncertainty about tech and competition and so forth. You then have to worry about when and what price to buy at, when and what price to sell at. There's a lot of things to keep track of. There are information asymmetries as in any market, but certainly here.Whereas I think that the symmetry to the upside of bitcoin is super compelling. I think the asymmetry upside of crypto VC is super compelling. All that middle ground I find is a little bit more evenly balanced at best in terms of upside/downside, but with exponentially more risk and complexity. And there's some people who do it extremely well. Some of those people have the talent. Some of them maybe have some information assymetry as well, which helps. I want come back to this thing I've put a pin in about the non-financial aspects. I mean, bitcoin is sometimes lost on people who live in countries where their monetary regime is pretty stable. They have confidence in their currency, the institutions that govern them, and so forth. But that's a very small minority of the planet, and having a decentralized sovereign money... And I'm actually flipping my terminology. I talked in my paper about non-sovereign, but as I thought about it, I think if you're going to call it sovereign money, insist that it's self sovereign that the world can use is really important. And the fact that anyone can access it is super important, and actually in terms of just human rights and so forth. And I think that's really important.And one of the other things that makes it so interesting... And while there will be other things built, Web3, which will have similar, especially around media and information and censorship and so forth, which will have similarly profound applications beyond just making money, this is a really big one and worth investing in and supporting. What we do apart from investing is, for example, we're quite active and philanthropically supporting, and as are a number of other people in the community, philanthropically supporting bitcoin open source development, which depends on developers. It's a computer program. It's a bunch of code maintaining it. And then with the tremendous conservatism that is the nature of the bitcoin community, making improvements or adding features to bitcoin has just happened in an important upgrade, or additional functionality was added, and so forth. And some people who do that don't require any kind of financial support, and some people do. And I think that's a really good thing to support, and there's a number of ways to do it. There's some charities that you can give to. For example, for US listeners, there US registered charities. And so that's something else that we're very committed to, of course, because it's supportive of our investment, but also because we think it's something that's really valuable for the world. Patrick: You said something there, which is, I think, really critical that that I want to highlight because I remember going through the journey of understanding gold in my twenties and wondering, ""Should I own some gold,"" and my conclusion being like, ""Why would I want to store value? I want to grow value, and the best way to do that is roughly global equities,"" and that's going to be my conclusion. And that it is interesting that gold today versus 100 versus 500 versus 1,000 years ago, it's purchasing power has been pretty constant. It's wild. Over very long periods measured in decades, it's kind of all over the place, and I'd rather grow value than store value. But I think your point is critical that yes, the ambition is to be a store of value, but it is at 700 billion, still some tiny, relatively small fraction of the market value of just gold. You could argue it should overshoot that, given it's a better version of gold in some ways for the digital era. But I just think that's a critical idea that you expect maybe to own less of it as it gets bigger and achieves that outcome and shift it into things that's more owning growth versus owning value. I just think that's so interesting. John: For people who own bitcoin, there's this question about when do you sell it? And people immediately start talking about target price and all that. And my answer to it is, I would only sell, but also willingly, in order to make more attractive investments. So that's the answer as opposed to, what's my target price. And that could happen for a couple of reasons. One is, there is simply potentially higher returning opportunities. And I do think that, why are we 15% allocated right now to crypto VC? Well it's because the things that we're investing in in that space and the managers that we're investing in are going to outperform, to be honest. Even my bullish views on bitcoin, one of these days they've got a good shot at it. And that's only going to increase over time because this tech broadly is going to continue to grow and, of course, there will be more and more things built and so forth. And again, because I do think Bitcoin will be successful. It's going to monetize it recently. And at some point the pace of return will begin to slow.By the way, something I had noticed today. There's this Bloomberg assessment that suggests that Changpeng Zhao or Changpeng Zhao, I think would be the right way to pronounce it, is founder and CEO of Binance. He is, in fact, a lot wealthier than the press acknowledged a year ago because of the value of Binance and the exchange. And it's kind of interesting that when asked, what crypto do you own personally... He also owns a fair amount. He only owns bitcoin in his own token, which is interesting for someone who's built what is perhaps the world's largest fortune through trading of this long tail of crypto assets. One of these things that, don't focus on what I say; focus on what I do with my portfolio.",2513
241,John Pfeffer - Adapt and Evolve,Buying and Selling Capital," Patrick: There's this really interesting question against all of this, where again, because of how you live your life, you mentioned your game is investing. So you're always looking for interesting ways to think about opportunity cost, and bitcoin plays a part in that and deploy capital in an effective way, not just to create value, but to capture a lot of it. We've talked a lot about these concepts. Given today's environment, it seems like an interesting question to explore the supply and demand of capital itself and this kind of notion that I've had, which is. Look in the technology space, it seems like you'd rather be a buyer than a seller of capital. We talked about this the other day and you said, ""Yeah, that's true."" But the fact is, you and I both have a lot of capital to sell, right? So as an investor, you're selling capital. So talk me through this again against the backdrop of a really cool, interesting career. The buying versus selling of capital question to me is really interesting, and I'd just be curious for your general take on it. John: I inevitably get people who contact me asking for advice about breaking into private equity or whatever, because that was what I did two industries ago. It's a great risk return activity, but right now in the current environment, you'd much rather be a buyer than a seller of capital if you can do it. And by seller of capital, I'm meaning investing, and buyer of capital means building a new business that consumes capital. At the highest level, it's just obvious that you would, in the current environment where capital is relatively abundant but yields are still negative, massively negative... and okay, maybe now going to become somewhat less negative but they're probably going to stay negative. Real yields are going to stay negative for the foreseeable future. It's kind of obvious that you'd rather be a buyer than a seller of something whose price is negative. Now ,of course, the challenge is for maybe people like me who are someone in both sides with an investment, but also building a business, you do the same thing. In practical terms, a little bit the challenge is, yes, I mean, that's the right answer and you still kind of say what I do with a capital, well, you could just park it and maybe that's the right thing to do, but to me, the difficult thing is that you can't say I've got this much money, I'm going to go start different investments. I'm going to go start 20 different companies that I'm going to build using 5% of each of my capital pool. Your constraint is not you're going to be your capital, it's going to be your top. And so, that's where I find tension and that's what unfortunately I think means that if you've got capital, it's hard to get fully away from selling capital at some point as much as that would be the optimal thing to do if you want to be diversified. Patrick: I'd love to use it as an excuse to talk about the supermarket experience in Europe. You're a buyer and seller of capital, in this case, your own, you're a seller nice chunk of your time. There's a lot going on here and it's non-technology in a core sense. Tell me this story. I'm just fascinated by the fact that you're doing this alongside everything else we've talked about. John: First of all, the business is 10 European outlet supermarket and it's unique, but actually fairly straightforward in that the key innovation is the way it sources. And so, what it does is it's fairly typical supermarket. It doesn't include fruit and vegetable or whatever, but it covers other kinds of food and drink and health, beauty, cleaning. It sells top brands and it does so at about a 30% discount to the discounters. And the way it does that is that it's a dynamic assortment so it's buying opportunistically as opposed to on a systemic contractual basis and it does in Europe when the core principles of the EU is free movement of goods and free movement of people. And so, this really builds on that free movement of goods to the extreme, which is we have a team of buyers who are buying opportunistically across all of Europe, taking advantage of overstocks, production problems, whatever, and then matching that with the market to create what it feels like a really premium supermarket experience is just this is what's happening and this is why it can be that premium experience while being 30% cheaper on average. And it's innovative and it's working quite well thankfully and growing very fast.We open a new door every, say, nine days. It's a great business. I think it has tremendous potential across Europe and the story behind it was I was working with a great friend and someone who had worked with originally well at KKR who had run a couple of portfolio companies, Tony De Nunzio, who's a very prominent retailer, because I'm not obviously. Been friends for many years and we were talking about, looking for ideas and business models. And this was, whatever, back in 2013 and identified this as an idea and then met the CEO of the business, Carlos Bejar, who built a big supermarket chain in Brazil. He's from Spain but he built a big supermarket chain in Brazil, so he had this both sort of tremendous industry experience, but also experience as an entrepreneur. And so, we launched it and actually, the original format wasn't quite what it is today. We had to iterate and figured out exactly what it ended up being to get something that I think is really, really great. It's true it's not tech. In fact, it's rather intriguing literally physical retail. It is not even e-commerce. It happens to be a segment where really, it's not threatened by e-commerce and I think, look, yes, okay, why? Well, sometimes life is not all top down. Sometimes it's bottom up. Sometimes there are opportunities and you seize them and that's from just a business and financial perspective. And I think it's going to be a very good investment and I know it already has been, but also, it's good to have your mind also think about something that's so fundamentally different with a chunk of my time. I think that's really good from that perspective.The only material non-tech thing that you do is capital solutions, special sits investing in Brazil, actually and that's just a whole other thing. I've got just these amazing friends and partners there and it's not at all tech, interestingly, because it's like capital solutions, special sits, and I'm going to bring a whole new idea into this thing, but I look at it as my deflation hedge, which is when I say capital solutions or special sits, you're talking about typically debt equity hybrid securities. One of the challenges of thinking about the uncertainty of the next year is overinflation versus deflation is the assets you would want to own in an inflationary environment are... they're opposite from what you would want to own in a deflationary environment. And while most people are worried about inflation, there is deflation scenario out there, maybe it's unlikely, but it's not zero. Again, Cathie Wood at ARK talks about this and tech kind of being a driver. I'm probably over-intellectualizing it, but the fact that it's these hybrid debt equity securities for a percentage of our portfolio is kind of a nice hedge in case that came to pass. It's also just fun. Patrick: Can you just describe why that is? Why with different... John: Let's say that we get into a deflationary environment. Well, the asset you want to own is, now that I think about it, it's fixed income. You want to get your capital back plus something, but the problem with that is in an inflationary environment, that's exactly what you don't want. If you're unsure, it's like, well, we might get inflation, we might get deflation. It's like driving with one foot on the gas and one foot on the brake to have a portfolio that does those two things, whereas this, because it's hybrid, if there's inflation, the equity component of the investment will mature that you make money in real terms notwithstanding inflation, but if it turns out there's deflation, the debt component of the investment means you're going to get your capital back plus something in nominal terms. I kind of like that. And by the way, let me just riff a minute on deflation. I think public blockchain crypto is a deflationary technology like no other. You can kind of derive that from all the stuff we've been talking about, but first of all, compared to the status quo, as I said, much more of the value created will go to users and maybe the developers rather than investors, RIN seeking is going to be really hard because of velocity, open source, interoperability, copying, forking, and you've got software style economics. What I mean by that, in my 2017 paper, I talked about sort of say, well, in the end layer one blockchain crypto assets are going to converge in the quantum compute and then that cost of compute is going to decline based on Moore's law.But what it in fact is the case, it's better than that from a user macro perspective and worse than that from an investor perspective in that it's, Moore's law, you get whatever doubling of compute every three years or whatever it is right now. I forgot the pace, or two and a half years. I forgot where it is right now, but the software economics, it's like orders of magnitude faster. And I'm just going to allude here to ZK-Rollups in that Ethereum economy of, we need gas to conduct a certain amount of economic computations or transactions on the blockchain, it's not like ZK-Rollups are twice as good or twice as efficient. They're many orders of magnitude more efficient. And what ZK-Rollups allow you to do is to run your computation, your smart contract, your program off chain then delivers back a proof that the layer one can validate. And the consequence of that is that the amount of gas, which is the... now, we're getting into how Ethereum works, but you actually pay miners gas, which is this internal currency on Ethereum that you buy with ETH to pay for computations or whatever. This basically means all of a sudden, you need orders of magnitude less gas to do a whole bunch of computation. You're just basically paying for updating state and you're doing it for this massive amount of off-chain work. And it's just massively deflationary. You've got this kind of stuff, which means that the efficiency of this technology is potentially going to grow much faster because, again, it's software style economics instead of even Moore's law hardware type economics. And so, the interesting thing about that is coming back to, well, let's say we really do move a big part of the economy onto this tech. I think that is going to become massively cheap and it's going to capture really infinitesimal value relative to economic activity going on.",2378
242,John Pfeffer - Adapt and Evolve,"Living in a Connected, Global World"," Patrick: As we start to kind of wind down our conversation, I want to appeal to something that we started the conversation with, which is about this unique experience that you've had living in 10 countries, visiting a million more, speaking different languages, the ability to shed past pairs of clothes for new ones in a distinctly quick way, let's say. With all that in mind, how should we think about the nature of the globe and its interconnectedness?We've talked a lot about tech interconnectedness and the interoperability and the composability of it all and how much that speeds things up. It seems like maybe there's a countervailing force in the world of politics and countries and geographies where globalization, which has provided us with a lot, may be going the other direction that countries may becoming more insular, especially the United States where most of the listeners are to the show, trading less, less dependent on global trade relationships or whatever. As someone that is a very worldly person, do you think that that's true as a concern? Is it something you think about in your portfolio? Say a word on just the nature of countries and globalization and the future there. John: I'm not sure my opinion is any more valuable than anyone else's on this, but I would say the following. First of all, as you can imagine, personally, I love globalism. I think there should be freedom of movement everywhere and don't like this whole, and really reject notions of nationalism and all of that. It is somewhat more that way than it was, but whether that's a trend and how sustainable a trend is, in historical terms, we're talking about very short timeframes. I would temper some of this by saying things are cyclical and cycles are getting shorter and faster on everything for a bunch of reasons. One of them being that the environment is changing faster. The technological world that we live in is changing faster and faster. I might more say I'm not so much sure that I think it's going one direction or the other than to say, I think that both the range of potential outcomes, the amplitude is greater than ever. And the speed at which we'll cycle through stages and maybe pendulum swing back and forth worth will get faster and faster. And therefore it's really, really, really hard to predict, meaning, I can sit here and rattle off innovations that will probably come to pass this decade that are so profound to begin with that it's difficult to imagine how one of them affects our existence, let alone the combination of them.And that means that it becomes absurdly difficult to guess the social political responses to that. And it could be all over the place. And one of the things I found fascinating about the pandemic having seen it for many different countries and whatnot is how literally we all have the same facts. You can go on the internet, they're all the same. Infection rates, hospitalizations, all the data, it's all out there, it's on the internet, we all have the same information. How radically different that data is interpreted in terms of opinion, public opinion and political opinion and media, is just staggering. And so, as we are in a world that's going to be changing faster and faster, I find it really, really hard to guess. And so, I actually had this conversation with our younger founding members. We got this big extended family and we're all sitting around together over the last couple of weeks and talking about some of this. And actually, the same question came up at the table. We were talking about how things are going to change. And I was a young person to prepare for that.And I said, ""Well, look, don't know, but here would be some thoughts. I think one is be data-driven, be analytical, learn to be a problem solver, be aware of and consciously fight against your cognitive biases and also be a Bayesian. Think probabilistically, update your probabilities, don't think in terms of certainties, update your probabilities fast, don't anchor yourself where you don't need to, and recognize that you're probably going to be doing so many different things in you your own life, it's those things that are going to be the core skills as opposed to something you're going to specifically learn or even whatever PhD you're doing right now. I have no idea where things are heading, but I think it just drives us back to being adaptable."" Patrick: I have a strange question for you. Why don't you believe in asking people where they're from, which seems to be the most common opening question that we ask anybody. John: I think it's literally the least interesting thing about a person. And the reason is because knowing something about a person that they had no control over gives me no information. What I want to know about are the choices that they made and where they're going. There's this kind of saying in the family, which is, don't ask me where I'm from, ask me where I'm going, because that tells me who this person is. And so, I find it really weird, this question, not only is there a devoid of information, but really strangely besides the point and something that we should all stop focusing on. Patrick: Are there any other things that you like to focus on getting to know somebody that you think are unorthodox, things about their life or what they're working on, or just favorite questions of yours that you find yourself returning to? John: There's this kind of actually quite annoying cliche conversation question, which is what are you working on, but maybe just looking for less annoying ways to ask that. First, I think if you just have the discipline saying, ""I'm not going to ask where somebody's from,"" because when you ask somebody where they're from, where they were born, what's really happening is your animal brain is looking to not make effort. And by not making effort, it's looking to, with a minimum amount of information, put somebody into a box, which we do because brains consume energy. And so, we like heuristics because they save us time and energy, and if someone answers whatever the answer, we immediately assume a bunch of stuff about a person. That's the reason we do it, which is just laziness. Just simply refusing the laziness of saying, ""I'm not going to ask that,"" and then saying, it kind of forced you to ask about, ""What are you doing? Where do you spend your time? What is your attention? What are you planning on doing new and different this year?"" I don't know, hopefully less obnoxious ways of phrasing what are you working on, but that kind of thing is to me far more interesting as a way to get to know somebody and far more informative. Patrick: I find it amazing when I saw that Larry David episode about hating small talk and just trying to get to medium talk as quickly as possible. That's the story of my life, sounds like yours too.My second to last question is about building portfolios kind of writ large in this private group that I've been a part of creating called Frontier. We were talking, one of the discussion points was called why not SPY, which is this idea that as a default place to put your capital, maybe SPY is wrong, maybe Vanguard total market fund, the cost three basis points or something is the right answer, but global equities or domestic equities, that has been an incredibly good thing to invest in. It's been a very high bar to beat, most have been unable to do so over long periods of time if your horizon's long enough, but a lot of what we've talked about today potentially could put that in new light or make it a little bit harder to view that as the default asset. How would you think about that idea of why not SPY applied to just the general investor out there? John: Look, it's hugely unsettling to me that thought, to be honest. I've always been a big indexer and public equity markets and just sort of said, you know what, while I recognize efficient market theory is not accurate to the extreme, it's close enough. It's like a good model and it's close enough, meaning that I don't know that I can be operating at a level of stock picking where that imprecision of the model versus reality is going to help me out. That was great because it made one part of my life easy. Now, I do think that this whole discussion around the fact that this new tech rather uniquely is going to maybe in some subsets, sub applications, I should say, in some applications, that'll be great at value capture, some sub-applications, it will be poor at value capture, point one. Point two, the distribution of that value will be very different. And point three, it's not going to accrue in the form of equity nearly as much, at least not public equity. It might be private equity through venture.That one, two, three would suggest that you just take your retirement account and park it in the SPY or the Vanguard total stock market index, which would've been the right answer for the 20th and 21st century, as long as those products existed. And I think they've only been around 30 or 40 years, but you know what I mean. I think that there's a strong argument that that won't work, but again, that kind of comes back to this point of it's too risky not to own Bitcoin and I would send everybody there first and this whole conversation again, because the nature of the questions I've talked a lot about everything else, but I would just come back to the fact that to me, that as a store of value, as the native money in the internet, Bitcoin is the biggest no-brain investment out there. Next question is how much of your portfolio, and that depends a little bit on your tolerance for volatility and everybody's different, because it will remain volatile for some time, but I think that remains a thing. But then within this world, what would I do? And I kind of break it into three buckets. There's Bitcoin, there's crypto VC, which there's an access thing. Not everybody unfortunately can access, especially not the quality of funds that you want to be in and I can assure you that the best funds are much, much better than the second best funds and it's total power law. And those funds are extremely hard to access and so forth.And then there's this other thing, which is kind of the other liquid stuff. The middle is tough because it's complex. It is not a muchness. One of the fallacies of this space is, is that people look at that list of crypto assets on whatever, coin market cap or something. Imagine if you just logged into Bloomberg and it was just one long ST file dump of every conceivable investment that had nothing to do with each other. And I think investors are beginning to discern and realize that Bitcoin is different from a layer one crypto asset. It's different from a DOW. It's different from all these different things that they're beginning to, but still, I fear silliness like owning an ETH is like owning a share in Ethereum. No, it's not. And I think we're going to have to become much more discerned about this and it takes a tremendous amount of energy. It's extremely difficult. It takes a lot of information access. Human beings are, they can very quickly be like dogs chasing squirrels in the park and you never catch one because there's always another squirrel to chase. And it is true that, oh, well, there'll be a headline that will say, this crypto asset outperformed Bitcoin and did this and that. And then people start chasing that stuff. Question is, okay, but look back over many, many years, there's really not much from, say, the 2017 crop that is even still there, let alone out from Bitcoin.See, when I wrote my paper, Ethereum was trading between 0.09 and 0.15 ETH per BTC. It's right now trading at about 0.075, meaning below in Bitcoin terms. Everybody's like, ""Oh, but ETH's outperformed."" Well, no. Now, it depends on what your timeframe is. Looking back from the summer of '17, it's underperformed Bitcoin. If you look back from one year ago, it's outperformed Bitcoin, but that's the exception. And if you go to pretty much everything else that was on coin market cap in 2017, it's massively underperformed or even disappeared. I'm confident people underestimate by how many orders of magnitude more risky investing in liquid crypto assets other than Bitcoin is compared to investing in Bitcoin. And they say, ""Yeah, but it's maybe high return."" But the thing is, is that it's orders of magnitude more risk and maybe higher return or maybe lower return depending on what you do. I don't think you're getting paid for that. That would be my comment. Sorry, that was a very long-winded answer to say, I think you've got to diversify out of equities. We do, but I think within that, I think you need to be very thoughtful about not letting that be translated into, and now I'm going to go day trade alt coins. Patrick: John, every time we've talked, I've learned a tremendous amount about thinking through the prospective returns as investors, but behind that, all of the interesting things that are going on in the world. And I think what I'll remember most about this conversation is this dislocation of the traditional equilibrium between users, labor, developers, whatever, and capital investors and how that may shift around going forward and just the impacts that all this stuff could or may have on our lives as users, which I think is very good as investors in our portfolios. It's been such a neat wide-ranging conversation. My closing question for everybody is to ask the same thing, which is what is the kindest thing that anyone's ever done for you? John: Oh gosh. My wife agreeing to marry me. Patrick: Simple. Can you tell that story? John: It's comically unromantic, but so, we met at a friend's birthday party and it was classicly funny, literally within 30 seconds, I knew this was the love of my life, the woman of my life. I was completely convinced and she, within five minutes, kind of got up and walked away. And it took me a month to get her to even go to dinner with me. I managed to break through. And then, what happened was we were, this was Buenos Aires in 1994, and for business reasons, something came up where I had to... It was like, well, there was an opportunity in Brussels. And I said, ""Well, this is really interesting. Why don't we move to Brussels?"" And she's like, ""Are you nuts? You want me to..."" She was an elementary school teacher and just finishing up a degree and she's like, ""You want me to quit my job and move to another country?"" And I was like, ""Yeah."" And that night, I dreamt, and I don't know if anyone was old enough to remember this, but I dreamt of us walking off of the Sabena, which was the old Belgium International Airline airplane into the old Zavantem airport, which was really horrible. And so, in my dream, we got off and she literally turned around, just got back on the plane.I woke up that next morning and I said, ""You know what? I was thinking we should get married."" Literally, my mind was thinking I need a signed contract. And she was like, ""No, I was thinking, now we could just live together for..."" ""No, no, no, you don't understand. We got to get married."" And then it went back and forth like that for a few weeks. And then finally I said, ""Look, we got to decide what to do with this opportunity, so we got to set a deadline."" And then we decided on that deadline we'd get married. It was comically unromantic, but that was clearly the kindest thing anyone has ever done for me is my wife agreeing to marry me. Patrick: With the same lens of infinite time horizon, what do you think are the most actionable keys to cultivating a good marriage over a long period? John: We've been married now for coming on 28 years. And of course, we got married relatively, I mean, I'm 53 and we got married pretty young. And so, I talked earlier about all the different changes, countries and industries and all this change. And what has been great is that we've really grown up together and the best analogy, the three-legged race. Two people who put one leg into a roll-up sack or whatever, and then you try to run together. And the whole funny thing about it is, is that you got to stay synced and then you get a little bit out of sync and then you have to get back into sync. And if you don't, you fall down and you have to get back up and stay in sync, and that's the game. To me, it's that. We sort of get out a little bit out of sync sometimes, but then we both have one leg each in the same roll-up sack, and so, we re-sync pretty fast. One of us will kind of go off in some direction. They'll be like, well, wait a minute, let me come back into the rhythm or person two adapting rhythm to person one. And it's worked really, really well, and I think that useful kind of mental image for us.And I think that there's this whole kind of thing about we got married very young and obviously, and in a very kind simple way, you met somebody at a party and it was kind of instinctive and all of that. And I think that people overthink these things and I overthink most things, but not those things. And I think that we don't trust our instincts enough. Think about in evolutionary terms, when we're talking about most of the stuff we've talked about today, our ancestors 100,000 years ago from the Savanna were not confronted with these issues and our brains are not involved in a way where our intuition is going to help. On the other hand, 100,000 years ago, we were mating and forming families and raising kids and these kinds of things. And therefore, our intuition's probably aren't very well-evolved for those types of things. And so, our existence today can require us to be super analytical and all of that, but that doesn't mean that you should apply that reflex to things that we are actually evolved to deal with intuitively. Patrick: What a cool closing thought. I'll think of that roll-up sack three-legged race often. I think that's a perfect analogy. I was married young too and 12 years in myself. I love the idea. I've loved our conversation. John, thanks so much for all your time. John: It's been a pleasure.This site uses cookies to improve your browsing experience.

243,Geoffrey Moore - Building Gorilla Businesses,Introduction," Patrick: My guest today is a renowned tech, author, consultant and venture partner at Wildcat Venture, Geoffrey Moore. Geoffrey has spent his career focused on the dynamic surrounding disruptive innovations. And his book, Crossing the Chasm, has become a canonical work for young businesses trying to unlock mainstream markets. This discussion is a masterclass on business strategy. We start with Geoffrey's more recent work on category defining businesses, break down his life cycle of adoption framework and close with the ways messaging should change as companies evolve. Please enjoy this great discussion with Geoffrey Moore.",123
244,Geoffrey Moore - Building Gorilla Businesses,What Makes a Gorilla Company," Patrick: Geoffrey, your books were some of my earliest education in the world of the competitive landscape of technology. I'd actually start at the end in terms of how I think about your work, which is with the concept of a gorilla as a business. Everyone's going to know, Crossing the Chasm. We're going to talk a lot about all the insight from that book and that thinking. But I think the gorilla as a concept is for me a great unifying theme of your work, aspirationally we all are going to want to be gorillas or invest in gorillas, or start gorillas at some point. Maybe just begin there. What do you mean by a gorilla company? Define that for us to begin. Geoffrey: The simplest definition is a market share leader in a powerful category. In order to sort of take that model apart, we created something called the hierarchy of powers. The idea behind the hierarchy of powers was, go back to investing. If you want to invest in a successful company, you want to invest in one that has more competitive advantage than the alternative investments. How would you actually analyze competitive advantage? That led us to something called the hierarchy of powers. This is the core investment model by on the Gorilla Game and a book called Living on the Fault Line and Going Forward. The hierarchy of power says the most powerful power is what we call category power. It has to do with the technology adoption life cycle, and where is the category that this company specializes in monetizing, where is it in its adoption life cycle? For most businesses most of the time it's on what we call main stream. In other words, the category's been established for a decade or more, there's budget for it. It's settled out. There's a pecking order of vendors in the category and the category probably grows close to GDP growth rates. Value investors spend most of their life with categories in that world.Tech investors, and my whole world is tech. We invest at the beginning of these life cycles. Sometimes before this, there's not even a category, it doesn't even exist yet, it's called category creation. But the key moment in that category development life cycle or what they call the technology adoption life cycle, is when all of a sudden the world goes all in on the new paradigm. The way we went all in on cloud computing, the way we went all in on mobile apps, the way we've gone all in on streaming video. When it goes all in what happens is, all of a sudden the world which in a prior year did not have budget for this category, now everybody has budget for this category. And so it creates this huge secular uplift and spend, we called it the tornado. We had a book called Inside the Tornado, huge secular. That's category power. If you are in that category, that rising tide floats all boats, that is the number one predictor of your future success for the next several years. That's why you see these incredible valuations in companies that are losing money because the investing community said, yeah, but they're in the hot category. Having said that, the next thing we said is, well, that category is going to sort out with a pecking order. The power law of returns from that pecking order is, the gorilla is going to get the lion share or the gorilla's share if you will.Number two will probably get half of what the gorilla gets. And number three will get half of what the chimp gets. And so that led to gorilla to chimp monkey sort of returns. And so the idea behind the Gorilla Game was, you would see a category going into tornado. You would buy a portfolio of companies that could win. As you saw who was winning, you would gradually exit the ones that are monkeys and chimps and put more and more money into your gorilla. And then you would hold the gorilla because the gorilla's power position, what happens is the ecosystem forms around the gorilla, which instantiates the gorilla permanently in that category. Now you can screw it up, but in general, it's not just that the gorillas powerful during the tornado, even on main street, the world is now organized permanently around the gorillas de facto standards and whatever. There was just a clear sense of the sooner you could identify the gorilla and then concentrate in the gorilla, the better it would go. Patrick: I love it. I remember the standout idea being that success from the investing standpoint is actually about less diversification as this gorilla gets identified that you want to consolidate your bet in the category winner. And there's so many things to pick apart here. I'm going to bounce around. I promise the listeners we're going to build this complete picture. Maybe given an example, before we go deeper into some of the abstract ideas around all of this. A favorite example of maybe three companies that went into this tornado period, where it was uncertain who the gorilla was going to be. And then the story of how they arranged into this gorilla, chimp, monkey hierarchy. I just think putting a real world example around it will help people understand the based concept. Geoffrey: In the client server days, the relational database, there was Oracle, it was relational technology and it was informants. Gradually Oracle emerges as a gorilla, and even Informix were chimps. And so what happened was Informix got acquired by IBM. By the way, that's one of the things that a chimp can do is say, ""Okay, I'm not the gorilla, so I need to join a bigger consortium."" And RGI finally just went away. Excuse me, and then Sybase took a shot at it. Sybase played what we call a chimp role, where they on Wall Street with Sun, they actually dominated a market segment, the financial sector, but they never became a general purpose or resource. And eventually Sybase got acquired, I think by SAP, I can't remember. I think it was, SAP, yeah. That's one story. It was Cisco. It was Juniper, and there was Bay Networks. It was all these things. Okay. It became Cisco. Once it becomes one of these things, then you have Cisco certified engineers. Then you have Cisco APIs.If the world goes well, the safe buyers, nobody ever got fired for buying, and originally it was IBM. The original one was IBM. There was Borroughs. There was Honeywell, there was Control Data. There was all these original companies. I think the most interesting current gorilla is Salesforce. Salesforce got ahead fast enough. They didn't really have a direct challenger. They just took on share away from the client server world. But now you're seeing there's Workday on the back end and there's ServiceNow. There's a lot of interesting companies in that area. But Salesforce is the gorilla, meaning people form around that cluster. I think what an investor needs to understand, is it's not just the company, a company power is a function of your allies as well as of your own enterprise. And so it's the sum of the company itself plus all of the innovation that comes from its ecosystem equals their total company power within the category. Patrick: I want to come back to category creation and how you think about the idea of a category itself, but this is a great excuse to talk about your notion of architecture. If we were to think about a two by two matrix or something with open and closed architecture on one access and proprietary and non proprietary on the other, this is for me, a critical unlocking idea. Salesforce is a great example. Most power full version of a gorilla. I love the litmus test that you never get fired for blank. The blanks are the gorillas. But talk us through this concept of architecture. Why is this so important within a category? What does it mean? And what does that two by two matrix mean? Geoffrey: The difference between open architecture and closed architecture was, Apple has a very closed architecture. You don't participate in Apples architecture. Whereas Android has a very open architecture. Okay. The idea is, do you want other people to complete your solution? The cable box was contained, but the Roku is an open architecture. In general, I think originally it was all closed. The IBM architecture was just IBM. DEC was just DEC. The Sun just Sun. No, actually it was Sun, they began to do open architecture. They would buy their storage from a different vendor or you'd get your operating system from the Berkeley operating system. That was the beginning of open architecture. I think what we learned during the last 20 years is in general open architecture beats closed architecture, because closed architectures always have a single point of failure. Meaning if any part of the closed architecture doesn't work, you can't ship. In an open architecture if you have a failure of one component, you can get it from another vendor and get back in the game.Now open architecture is harder to manage for quality, and so that was always the challenge, but that was closed versus open. Proprietary versus non-proprietary, has to do with who gets to control the next release of this thing. Open source is not proprietary. Open source, there's no locking. But proprietary there is locking. And so the most powerful idea was proprietary open architectures, where you had proprietary control of an ecosystem that involved other companies, but they had to eventually play to your standard. That's what gave the gorilla the most power. Because now what the gorilla can do is, you have to stay with me, I'm a market mover. I don't just move my own products. I move everybody's products. By the way, by staying with me, you leave my competitor behind. Every time I differentiate from my competitor, then you conform to my standards, you just made yourself incompatible with their standards. Patrick: Do you have a favorite open proprietary example? Geoffrey: For example, in the relational database thing, there was a concept called row level locking. Sybase did it one way and Oracle did it another way. Because all the independent software vendors, the SAPs and the people source and all the people that wanted to build applications on top of a relational database, had to choose. They went with the Oracle approach to role level locking, which disenfranchised the Sybase one. And so Sybase therefore had to go into a specific market who said, we're willing to do your form of role level lock in because in the financial services industry, we have a bunch of problems that Oracle's not helping us with. You will help us with it. That created something we call market segment power. Sometimes we call that gorilla in the niche. It's the chimp strategy. The chimp can no longer compete with the gorilla head on across horizontal markets, but they can still win in verticals. And so that was what Sybase did on Wall Street, successful for them. Patrick: How do you think that new companies should think about this matrix of open and close proprietary, and not in the early days of their businesses and products and strategies? It feels like something that we can talk intelligently about after the fact, but do you think it's something that can be incorporated early on in a business's strategic thinking? Geoffrey: I think it emerges organically. Remember now we're in a different landscape, where open APIs, the whole software infrastructure, the whole paradigms that were set by client server have all been overthrown to some degree by cloud and the whole micro services and open architectures and whatever today. It's much easier today to start a company and draw on enormous number of resources that are available, kind of any developer. Where the lock in starts to develop, is when you start creating differentiation, however you create differentiation. If that differentiation will attract customers to you, if you can build outward from that differentiation, the customers still want to stay with you, at some point that does create a proprietary position and some form of customer locking.Now, customers do not, as you know, are not very fond of locking. On the other hand, the only thing worse than lock in is probably not being locked in. Because what lock in creates, is it creates predictability. It's a little bit like fascism, I think. It's like they hate this tyrannical political system, but the trains run on time. I think Salesforce is a good example. You're not locked into Salesforce, but there's so many things that are now compatible. There's so many things that plug into it, at some point you go, yeah, but it's just too hard not to be with it. Now we're back to the nobody ever got fired for. Patrick: Yeah. The notion of Salesforce is world building. Whether it's this proprietary coding language, the things that hook into it, the annual Dreamforce event. Is interesting how it is both application on the one hand and enabling technology on the other. That's probably the next distinction that makes sense to dive into if open and proprietary is sort of the most defensible position for a gorilla. I think you would also argue that enabling technology companies, you can define what that means, are also superior to application technology companies. Maybe just draw that distinction to why it's interesting. Geoffrey: Well, it's important and it's interesting yin and yang. The only way the world's going to get value from technology is through applications. Whenever you are evangelizing the new category, it's important to get the applications out before the enabling infrastructure, because otherwise people won't buy into it. But once people start buying into the applications, then they want to start scaling them and they want to start enhancing them and elaborating on them. That puts enormous pressure on the enabling infrastructure. There's more money to be made in the horizontal than there is in the vertical. There's more speed in the vertical. You can go faster by going at the application. So when you're Crossing the Chasm, it's all about the application.But as soon as you get to the tornado, it very quickly becomes more about the infrastructure or the enabling infrastructure. Microsoft, Intel, Cisco, Salesforce, their platform technologies become their power place. Oracle had applications and database, but it was always the database. But the key thing is if you're in an enabling technology, you have to be humble about getting the applications out ahead of you or else if you just try to go out and say, we're the next enabling technology, it doesn't work. Because people are going well, yeah, but what's it for? I don't see that I have to buy it yet. You hook the market with applications and then bring them into the new infrastructure. Patrick: What's that been like watching more recently, if we think about the most pure play enabling technologies today? It might be the API companies, the Stripe, the Twilio, the Okta's of the world. Well, how did those companies solve this problem of you need the actual use case, the actual application? Amazon AWS is enabling technology, but it was its own best first customer on the retail side. So that application problem was solved by them. How do you approach these pure play, hire this API for this one function in your application type company? Geoffrey: It's typically around the use case. Like Okta, I think started with single sign on. People were just saying, this is such a pain in the neck, that I have to sign into this, have sign. Okta said, okay, we'll do single sign on. And then once you did single sign on, you thought, well, wait a minute, we're sitting in a very interesting piece of real state here. There's a bunch of highways coming together. Maybe we should have some service stations and a restaurant, we should build some hotels. That's what Okta did. But enabling infrastructure always starts with a problematic application use case that you can't solve with existing infrastructure.And so initially, first of all it looks like, well, your market is so small, there's only this one use case and there's only this one application and you're building all this technology to make that better. Are you sure you want to do that? And if that was the only return, the answer would be, well, no, it doesn't make any sense at all. But if you're say, no, that's my point of entry. And then expand, we called it the bowling alley phase of the technology adoption life cycle, where you'd say I, okay, I've got my first use case in my first industry. Can I get a second use case in that industry? Or can I find that use case in the second industry? Either way you were going to expand outward. And then at some point, if you can get enough expansion, the world goes well, hang on, this is the new infrastructure. That's when the tornado starts. Patrick: One of the really interesting things, again, going back away from company building advantage towards returns, I'll call them, for investors. One of the interesting observations we already mentioned was, you should consolidate into the gorilla, not be diversified in a category. But the second interesting observation in the book is that markets, stock markets in general, tend to underestimate the competitive advantage period, the potential returns all the things that it would normally care about for a company, for technology gorilla specifically. Why is that the case? Because investors are obviously always looking for things that are mispriced. So this if this is a source of mispricing. What is it? Why does it persist? Geoffrey: I think the sources of mispricing is that they're bringing a main street model view of marketplace divisions of power to a tornado influenced investing environment. What I mean by that is, you say General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler for 30 years or whatever it was. So you say, well, yeah, by market share, you can almost give them their advantages. If GM's got more than Ford, but Ford is still good investment and Fiat, Chrysler, they've had their issues, but that's good investment. But in the tornado world, because the forces of ecosystem pressure on de facto standards for the gorilla, they start disenfranchising the number. First of all, they disenfranchise the long tail. All the long tail can do is clone the gorilla. That is a play, but it's a commoditization play. But the chimps are the ones who have the hard hand to play because they're getting systematically disenfranchised. We overvalue the chimps and we undervalue the gorilla. It's the same high we just divided it wrong.What we're doing is we're using an arithmetic division. We should be using a logarithmic. It's a power law relationship, not a linear relationship. But most investors like lines better, they understand lines better than power laws. The game is, eventually, and by the way, this goes for M&A too. When people acquire a gorilla or a chimp, they're thinking that they're going to be able to compete against the gorilla, because I have this asset in my big portfolio and I've got all this access to customers. I can compete against this gorilla. Not really, because again, there's so many other companies in the world that are making a living with the gorilla. They just won't invest enough in a second set of standards to make that return on investment work.",4189
245,Geoffrey Moore - Building Gorilla Businesses,Architecture Inertia and Unlocking Trapped Value," Patrick: One of the interesting analogies in the book, this hearkens back to the idea of architecture, which the gorilla gets to set, builds the rules of the game as you've described. The one I liked was a country choosing whether it was a left lane or a right lane dynamic. And once that choice is set, that's it. It's basically good until we get flying cars, at which point is a new architecture. This thing is set. One of the ideas that I'd love to hear a bit more about is once that sector is set, I think what people don't understand is then for the entire rest of that category's existence, it's very hard to disrupt the winner until there's a new category created. Now we can start talking about what category means and all this fun stuff, but maybe just touch on that idea of duration and architecture inertia, if you will. Geoffrey: One of the things, it's interesting when you talk about investments, is people will often use the word category and market interchangeably. And for us, it was really important to say, no, these are two different concepts. The simplest way to do it is a category is defined by a set of competitors. And a market is defined by a set of customers. The category is competitors who offer products and services that address the same issue. A market is customers who have the same use cases and talk to each other. That talk to each other by the way, is a really important dimension of market. We made the point early, I guess, with Crossing the Chasm. A doctor in Japan is not part of the same market as a doctor in the United States. Because they don't talk to each other. Extending that aside. Now back to this issue of category. Category has a useful life until somebody comes along and says, that category, which when it came to power, actually released trap value in our business. By the way, I'm a B2B guy more than a consumer guy. So we're staying with the B2B mindset for a second. Why did somebody adopt the category in the first place? Well, because we had a set of business processes that were inefficient and this category allowed us to somehow redesign and re-engineer the process to make it more efficient.We said, okay, let's go get a bunch of that. Let's go get a bunch of SAP, BRP, because we need a back office system for enterprise resource plan. We did that for like 20 years. It's so successful, you come to a point where you go, you know what, that category is now the value trapping thing. We're all trapped in data centers. We all have to have our own data centers. We're all trapped in these applications that are unique and very hard to maintain. We all have these huge IT departments that are doing the same thing in our different companies. This is crazy. So then the cloud guy comes along. He says, well, hey, we do cloud. Okay? And so now all of a sudden that's when the new category wins, because the old category has gone from being the hero to becoming the villain. That's when category creation. But until that's happened, there's no point in trying to disrupt the category. In other words, people don't want to disrupt categories. People will claim the categories as long as they can, but they were cling to them up until the point where they realized, that's the thing that's holding me back, and that's when they're willing to change. Patrick: This is a great bridge into, first, the strategy behind category creation in the first place. This is for very early young technology companies. That'll give us an excuse to talk about the chasm and the adoption lifecycle and all the nuance there, which is just such a fascinating set of topics. I always tell startups that we're investing in, you want to be able to complete the sentence, company X, Y, Z, the global leader in blank. You want that to be true, even when the company is very young. And so the category can start very, very small. What advice would you give early companies as they think about creating and dominating a category, even if it's a 10 person team or something very young? Geoffrey: The first sentence I would work with, and by the way, I've been a venture capitalist, I'd want the venture capitalist to have the same sense. Where's the trapped value? Who knew that we had trapped value in the backseat of our cars? Well, Travis Kalanick figured out that. Who knew that we had trapped value in our spare bedrooms? Brian Chesky figured out that we had trapped value. Okay. The first is, where's the trapped value? Because that's what's going to reward. If there's no trapped value, there's not going to be a new category. The second thing then is what is trapping the value?Travis said, well, it's the dispatch system for taxi cabs. Brian said, it's the hotel reservation system for travelers. Well, I can use, both took essentially the same strategy on mobile overlay. You have to have trap value meets disruptive technology. That's it. The third variables you need an entrepreneurial leader, because actually this is not a journey for the faint of heart, but those are the two critical things. I'm going to redefine the hospitality space. I'm going to redefine the transportation space. I'm the global leader. I think what you would do is take whatever the category you're going to disrupt, and you say we are going to be the global leader in the next generation of category. Patrick: What's really interesting about the idea of trapped value, is that it sort of implies that there's nothing new under the sun. Meaning the trapped value is always in an existing thing. The things that humans do don't really change all that much, I guess, over time. And that trap value is really just about a suboptimal or something that's become suboptimal in a prior category. Maybe say more about what you've learned about identifying the features or characteristics of trapped value. Geoffrey: Until such point we think that we've now reached perfection, if I read the papers in the morning, I don't think we're a little shy of perfection. So as long as we're not at perfection, that means value is trapped somewhere, it's aways attractive. This gets important because, by the way it relates to this current generation of entrepreneurs, who are very interested in trap value and social issues as well. Climate change, health issues, educational issues, whatever. Trap value doesn't have to be just cash value. But the point is you have to be inspired to say, I want to change the world. It can't be, I want to change the world so I can become a billionaire. That's a really bad motive.If you become a billionaire because you changed the world, that's one thing. But to change the world to become a billionaire, it doesn't work. The issue is, where is the trap value? How urgent is it to address the trap value? The urgency is also an important issue. And at some point you say, well, yeah, this is what we want to go after. This whole thing with vaccines, mRNA vaccine approach to building vaccines, was built on the fact that it was taking us 15 years to build a vaccine. That's a lot of dead people. That's a version of trap value. Patrick: What kinds of questions do you enjoy asking people to get at the understanding of the value that maybe trapped that they're addressing? If you had to turn this into a set of question for, let's say you were a venture investor and all you cared about was identifying, there's got to be trap value, air go, I want to know what it is here. What kinds of questions do you think would help the entrepreneur that may have never heard that term before understand what you're after? Geoffrey: The way I evaluate an entrepreneur often, is to say, how well they answer that question. And some people go, they're on it like that. Particularly people who've had business experience and who've lived the trap value. I was a CIO for 10 years. This is a nightmare. Okay. Those are pretty easy. I'll give you an example of one where, for example, trap value, doesn't actually work. There's been enormous interest among a number of young entrepreneurs around taking a Fitbit like approach to health or to diabetes or to dieting or to whatever. It turns out that that trap value is so diffuse. It's worse than Shell oil. Trap value wants to be like those huge reservoirs of oil in the Gulf of Mexico, that's what you want, so you get a gusher. The opposite of that is, well, yes, they grind every single piece of Shell and the Canadian plateau you can extract well, but it's very, very long and slow. You're looking for concentrated trap value that there's a sense of release. If they don't have the sense of that, and often, by the way, you invest in two people.The other person's a technologists who says, I don't even know what this is for, but it's amazing. And so what they're doing, is going quantum computing or cryptocurrency, I don't know what it's for. By the way, you know what we're discovering? Cryptocurrency might be for Turkey, for the Thanksgiving Turkey, for hyper-inflationary economies. They've used the dollar historically. Maybe it's kind of like gold. Maybe it's a placeholder for gold, but the problem right now is, I think cryptocurrency is still hasn't crossed the chasm, because I don't think there's been a compelling use case other than speculation, which is, I think is in early markets. Patrick: One of the amazing things about the trapped value examples of the backseat of your car and the spare bedroom, is that they're tangible unused assets, concept just makes perfect sense there. How would we apply that idea to developer tools? I'll just go back to Twilio and Stripe. What's the trap value? Is it time? Geoffrey: It's time plus complexity plus error. It's a productivity play. But what's happened with, because we've gone to this digital transformation economy, the pressure on people to deploy software enabled processes faster at scale, has never been higher. The traditional tools become the merit. The very tools that enabled us to get this far are now holding us back from getting to the next place. There's always a trade off, because it's like, ""Oh God, I'd have to learned another set of tools? What is the shelf life of this category?"" When you see category, category, categories, it's like, okay, this is not really going to be more productive because I'm going to spend all my time learning the next technology. I'm going to have this very short, useful life of it. You have to be careful with that. Patrick: It reminds me of the Jeff Bezos undifferentiated heavy lifting concept. If everyone's engineering their own checkout, pay portion of their website, that just stupid. This has happened in one centralized place, like you said, less error probably because they're doing it at scale. There's an aspect of trap value that could be all about addressing that undifferentiated heavy lifting, horizontal common use cases across other applications, which make no sense to all build and house, because it's subscale. Geoffrey: But except that the reason why of people still do it, by the way every software group in the world would say, why do we have four different people writing the same sub routine? Why don't we write it once and use it everywhere? The answer is because they need it now. Because I think about things this way and they think about things that way. I don't want to uncover my brain with it. We will always proliferate lack of productivity and then centralize. What you do is, you do the heavy lifting in spite of the fact that it's long term unproductive, because in the short term it is productive. And then you create what they call tech debt, technology debt. And then at some point you have to think, oh crap, I have to pay down my technology debt. And that's when you say I'm going to commoditize these things into a standard platform. Platforming, the first goal of platforming is actually just to internally create a more productive workspace by essentially doing the heavy lifting once and not many times.But once you do that, if you then open that platform to your customers, now you're beginning to create this ecosystem where this Gorilla Game ecosystem. And then when you open it up to third parties, and if there's enough customers, you've attracted enough customers, the third parties want to come to work with your customers. And now you're playing the Gorilla Game. Now you're bringing people into your, and that's how the little company gets to be the big company. We call it strategic acts of generosity, where you essentially give away something. It's a little bit like a drug dealer. You give away something in order to get people to a certain amount of addiction, you're able to monetize down street. Obviously that's what Facebook did. It's what Google did. It's what digital media guys did initially. Patrick: In B2B, do you still see that? Is that still a common strategy? It seems a lot of technology is zero marginal cost, is such an interesting part of technology companies, software especially, that it allows you to give stuff away for free without crazy financing problems. Is that true in B2B? How do you think about that generosity in B2B and whether or not that's a unique strategy people should think about? Geoffrey: In B2C, it's proven to be really the only way. You just have to play that game. The problem with doing it in B2B is there's an opportunity, there's a total cost of ownership issue that the B2B, an exposure to risk and a bunch of stuff. Having said that, the notion of saying, ""Try before you buy,"" and then also the notion of consumption based pricing so you can buy it for 100 people and then extend, so that it's led to something called the land and expand sales motion, and it certainly led to something called customer success. We used to call customer success customer support. In that model, the customer had already bought the product. So they'd taken on the risk now of getting value out of the product, and customer support says, ""Well, we'll make the product work. It's your problem to be success with it. It's our problem to make the product work.In the subscription land expand model, it's like, ""No, no, no, no, no. If you stop using my thing, my business model collapses."" So customer support became customer success. And now the issue is, well, how are you trying to get value? How can we work with you? It's created a much healthier relationship between the vendor and the customer than ever existed before, because basically the customer now has more power and therefore the vendor has to collaborate more with them. In the '90s, it was drive-by selling. You sold, you promised them anything. As soon as the deal closed, you went out of town and you did not want to come back because they were going to lynch you if you did. But now it's no, the power's much more equally distributed.",3389
246,Geoffrey Moore - Building Gorilla Businesses,The Adoption Lifecycle," Patrick: Well, I'm proud of us for having gotten almost 45 minutes in and not yet talked about adoption life cycles. But now is the appropriate moment. I'd mentioned, we'd start at the end, which is where we want to get to if we're an entrepreneur and investor who's building or owning BI Gorilla for all the great things we've talked about, open architecture and horizontal enabling technologies, all these great features. But now we get to rewind back to the beginning. And obviously, I was completely shocked to see that Crossing the Chasm came out in 1991, because we think about it as this canonical technology book. And yet it came out pre-internet, which is very, very interesting. Bring us back to your first discovery of this life cycle of adoption. Maybe break it into the five categories for us for some language definitions. And then we'll talk through what's important sales and marketing wise at each stage. Geoffrey: In 1986, I joined a company called Regis McKenna, Inc. Regis was the premier marketing guru of high tech by far. And he'd written a book called The Regis Touch. And in that book was the technology adoption lifecycle. That's why I learned about the book. And I was a client of Regis's when I joined the company, which is great. So in that model, there are these five strategies for adopting technology that evolve linearly, meaning the first strategy is called the technology enthusiasts. And they're interested in the technology for its own sake. The visionaries who are interested in taking this disruptive technology and being the first to go after the trap value that they want to go after. And they're going to do that for first mover advantage, and frankly, just to put their mark on the world. Then the next group of the pragmatists. And what they say is, ""Well, I'll do it when I see other people doing it. I think it's a good idea, but I'm not sure when. So when everybody else is doing it, I'm going to do it. And I'm interested in the productivity of my business. I'm not trying to change the world. I'm just trying to make my world better, faster, cheaper on a day by day basis."" And then the fourth group were the conservatives who were going, ""Oh my God, not another technology. Please don't do this to me. So I will do it under duress. After all the pragmatists tell me I have to, I will do it."" And the skeptics who are saying this is never going to work in the first place. And then you guys are instruments of the devil and forget it.What I added to that model time, and I was at Regis for a while and I thought we had all these really great clients that were just crushing. They had these incredible PR events. Everybody was saying, ""This is the next big thing."" And then they go off the radar. What the hell happened? What that led to was that there was a chasm, a gap, in that life cycle between the technology enthusiasts and the visionaries who were both willing to go early, they believe what you believe, they buy into what you want, and the pragmatists who are not willing to go early, but who would go once they saw others go. Well, that created kind of a junior high dance problem. Like, ""Well, I'm not going to go out there until you go out there."" And that's what the chasm was. The chasm was just, ""I'm waiting. You're waiting."" This is when it became so important to define a market segment as people who talk to each other, because the way these people make the decision is through word of mouth. They talk to each other. ""Are you doing this yet? No, no, no. Okay. Me neither."" And then that was the chasm.The opposite of that is when you go and talk to each other and, ""You are, you are, you are. Oh my God, me too."" That's what created the tornado. So venture investing was all about. We want to get to a tornado. We have this really cool, disruptive trap value. It's going to warrant it. It's going to fund a tornado. It's going to be great. But the problem is between the early market and the tornado, you have to cross the chasm. Crossing the chasm, this is when we learned the applications lead before enabling infrastructure, you have to find that first use case and that first industry segment who will go ahead of the herd, not because they believe what you believe, but because they need what you have. But what you have to do is bring what a guy named Ted Levi called the whole product. You have to bring the complete solution to their problem or they can't play with you. But if you do bring the complete solution to their problem, they will adopt the new technology because frankly they're stuck. They really are in a bad place. They need to get out. Crossing the chasm looks a very unnatural act to the venture capital community and a natural act entrepreneurs because they were going, ""Well, wait a minute. We're horizontal for everybody and you're telling me this one use case and this one segment? What are you talking? The term is what are you talking about? I mean, I could remember Steve jobs with the Macintosh. That was the computer for everybody, right? So when it became desktop publishing in corporate art departments, he was furious. We did not create the Macintosh to be ... But in fact that was cross the chasm from the Mac. That's how they originally crossed the chasm because at that time people were making 35 millimeter slide presentations. And when you wanted to change one, you had to go down to Walgreens to get the new code. I mean, it was a mess. Okay. So the point which was a very tough problem based that.So this crossing the chasm thing became important to the venture community. In fact, so I'm associated with a new venture team called Wildcat Ventures. We're raising a crossing the chasm fund. So basically the deal's going to be, we're only going to invest in companies who have reached the chasm. In other words, they've had success with early market. They have product, but they don't have a winning position with pragmatist yet. And by the way, with a single round of funding, you should be able to get cross the chasm and dominate a use case in a single market within probably 18 to 24 months is kind of the normal timeframe for that. And there's crossing the chasm playbook and you can run the whole playbook. What I love about it is it's probably one of the best risk reward plays in all of venture. It's not the biggest reward. The biggest reward is to be the gorilla and the tornado, and that's just the game changer. But if you talk about the change in valuation between people who aren't getting traction, we sometimes call it the traction gap, the chasm and the traction gap for virtually synonymous, to no, I have traction. I have a real company. By the way, I'm growing a double digit rank in admittedly a small market. But I am the gorilla in that niche. And I'm expanding through growing pains. That play is, I think, a real cool opportunity in venture that we've always talked about. I don't think anybody's ever raised a crossing the chasm fund. So I'm kind of excited to be part of that. Patrick: Obviously to cross the chasm, you got to get to it first. And you've described two earlier segments, the sort of pure tinker technologists and the visionaries who are more commercial, I'll call them. But just earlier and more willing to, I guess, take the risk. What do you suggest companies think about in those first two stages? So from a cold start, you're not going to get to the chasm for a while. What's important in that first segment? Geoffrey: Well, first of all, you've got to create a pitch that will get you some venture capital. Well, that will fund ... And by the way, venture capital is designed to give you a little bit of money at a time. And by the way, the way you should think of venture funding is every round in funding is intended to get you to a new value valuation level. Just think about it from a venture capitalist point of view, because if you don't get to a new valuation level and you have to raise more money, you're going to dilute everybody who's in so far. But if you can get to a new valuation level, we're all real happy. So you should think of those as almost like quantum levels in an atom. And one of the mistakes that people make in venture capital is they call it the sucker round, where you invest in the second, you have to have two steps to get to a new valuation thing and you get completely, you don't get completely diluted, but you get painfully diluted. So then the question is, what are the valuation quanta of this journey?Well, the first one then is you have to create a very compelling demo. You often have the entrepreneur and residents model banded to that. Now you have to create the minimum viable product. And in business, that's got to be a product that you can sell to a customer, but you know that when you sell it to a customer, the customer's going to need a bunch of hand holding and you're going to have to do a bunch of extra work because the whole product doesn't exist at all. And even your product frankly has issues. But they pay for it and they give you feedback. So you're now in this alpha-beta world. When you get to something that's now a viable product, then the next thing you got to do, still in the early market, is you've got to get your first flagship customer. This is particularly important for B2B. A flagship customer is a known brand name customer. Oh, America express. Oh, JP Morgan. Oh, Disney. Okay. They've taken your product with a ton of extra help from you, and done something amazing with it. So it puts you on the map. And by the way, it isn't just an experiment. It's actually more important than that. They actually used it for competitive advantage. So they were able to do things that you were like, ""Holy smoke. These guys have really jumped ahead of their..."" Tesla, where they jumped ahead of the automobile industry. My understanding is that Tesla's market cap exceeds that of the other American car companies combined. Patrick: Oh yeah. By a lot. Geoffrey: Talk about category power company, gorilla power. Once you have one of those, now you're at the chasm because you're known and you have a product, but you still don't have a market position that has any meaning. So next step now is to cross the chasm by identifying a market segment that we call them pragmatists in pain who desperately need a solution, the conventional infrastructure just simply can't provide it. And you look at what their needs are. And obviously you're a great fit for some of them, because you wouldn't have picked them otherwise, but there's a bunch of stuff they want that you think, ""Oh my God, really?"" But the answer is, yeah, really. For that first segment, I don't care what it is they need. You don't have to do it all yourself. You can bring another company with you. You can bring two other companies with you. But you have to take that problem off their plate. By the way, once you do, they tell their friends. So everybody in that segment who has that use case goes, ""Really? There's a vaccine. You're kidding. Pfizer? Moderna? Which one? It's like, ""Okay, we're all going to do this together."" And very quickly you get this acceleration in sales.I mean, you can grow 200%, 300%. We often call it a double triple and then a triple double. So you go 3X, 3X, 2X, 2X, 2X. And that's because of the lot of small numbers. But now you're somewhere between 35 and 70 million dollars at the end of that journey. Now you're a growing concern. You're a real company. You have predictable sales, you have a sales force. One of the things you got to learn by the way is don't hire this. So there's three sales forces. This is a mistake that entrepreneurs make a lot. In the early market, the only real salesperson is the CEO. You need a salesperson, but they've got to be kind of a buffalo hunting, pioneering kind of salesperson. But when you're crossing the chasm, you need a vertically focused go-to-market thing, engine, where it's product marketing, product management, product marketing, sales and customer success, all focused on that one domain and that one use case. People don't make careers in sales to do that. That's actually who you need. Once you get to the tornado, now you need the conventional coverage oriented sales force. But hiring a tornado sales force when you're crossing the chasm, will cause you to lose your company. That's probably the single most common source of venture failure.",2861
247,Geoffrey Moore - Building Gorilla Businesses,Understanding What Makes Great Sales Teams," Patrick: I want to come back to the difference in the two types of sales forces and maybe even literally the characteristics of the people that are good at one versus the other. But before we do that, I need a clarifying question on pragmatists in pain. What have you learned about searching for what that pain point might be or could be? What does a good pragmatist in pain look like? Because I imagine the Macintosh, there could have been tons of those examples. They went with one in particular. What does good versus bad look like when searching for this pitch hat if you will? Geoffrey: The way you typically find it is during the early market, you've kissed a bunch of frogs. You had customer context. The sales force in the early market is always going to be thinking about use cases, although they tend to think of them as projects, meaning we could solve that use case. We just assign some people do it on a one off basis. But at the same time, the person who's the general manager who's sort of taking the longer view is, ""Which use case had the most urgency?"" And you want it to be contained trap value. It's not a big reservoir, but it's not shared oil. In other words, there is a real trapped value in a really nasty spot that if you could get it out, it would work. You get that by essentially either prior experience in other companies or your own sales force just talking to people in their prospects. And then your actual sales, it's a use case based dialogue.So you sort say, ""Well, what are the use cases people have, whether you're using our product or our competitor's product or the prior technology's product?"" And then what use cases have that sort of flashing red light quality? Cause people will complain. I mean, people will say, ""Look, I need help."" But you need that signal from the market. Then you want to validate the signal. So then you go back, you say, ""Was that just you? Or is that endemic to the use case?"" In the case of documented, which was in the first crossing the chasm book, it was Syntex who was saying in order to submit approval proposal to the FDA, they had a 500,000 page document. This was an era where we actually printed things. And they were assembling it in the FedEx truck on the way to the FDA. So that was a pragmatist being. Patrick: I love the apple example, because I think everyone knows the Macintosh, everyone knows Jobs. Probably a lot of people didn't know the specific niche that they went after to begin. Is there one or two more recent examples that kind of every listener might appreciate and go, ""Oh, aha. I get what that means now.""? Geoffrey: Microsoft had SharePoint. And SharePoint was an enterprise secure document repository, much lighter weight document. And frankly, most purposes, you didn't need that. SharePoint was great. But it was hard to use. So then this guy Drew Houston did Dropbox. So Dropbox was like, ""Well, this is incredibly easy to use."" It was a little bit insecure. It was kind of out there. And you said, ""Anybody, hey, I'll show you my photos. And some of my photos, maybe you shouldn't even look at. But it was sort of going off it. So what box did was they came along and said, ""Look, for people who are dependent on sharing documents as part of their core getting things done and need a secure place to do that, but who really cannot abide the ease of use of Dropbox."" And that hit. And it resonated with every CIO on the planet because they were all getting pressure to have a really simple file share, but they were also getting pressured to be secure. So that was an example of a pain point to take to go right after. Patrick: So understanding the pragmatist in pain as a critical thing to understand and then target. Talk to me all about that sales motion that you've seen be successful. So to build a vertical use case sales motion completely, really focus your efforts and your man hours and everything else on one thing."" What does that look in contrast to the more broad, horizontal future sales plan? Geoffrey: So the first thing is when you're in the early market, your marketing communication is about the technology breakthrough. It's about all the possible amazing things that could happen with this new technology. You're trying to attract people who believe what you believe. And then they say, ""Yes, it is amazing. Let's work together and let's make something happen."" When you cross the chasm, it's like these people do not believe what you believe. They're suspicious of what you believe. But so now we're looking for what they need, what you have. So the first thing then is your marketing campaign has to identify, you have to strategically commit to a use case. Then your marketing is you actually go out. First of all, it's very economical because you just go into the segment you're targeting. You actually are targeting a job title in that segment, the process owner who owns the NDA submission insider syntax, who's not been getting a lot of attention you can imagine.But now all of a sudden you say, ""No, we're here for you."" The PeopleSoft guys went to the HR people, the HR people wept, because nobody had ever called them in before. You show up at their door and you say, ""We know your problems."" You qualify the customer. ""Do you have this problem? Because if you don't, we're both in the wrong room. Oh! You do have this problem."" Now when you bring the sales force, you still need a salesperson and you still need a technical person, but you need a domain expert person. And this is the person who's an expert in the domain, in the use case from the customer's side of the table. They've lived this use case. They know it. Customer just goes, ""Oh my God, a kindred spirit. And you're on the other side of the vendor, ""Wow. Come on to my side of the table.""By the way, you don't use discounting to cross the chasm. These are high value use cases. You charge full up for them, but you deliver 100% on them. So that's the third piece of the go-to-market. You need a customer success motion, which says failure is not an option because if you fail in that situation, they also tell all their trends. And now you're screwed. Once you pick this thing, failure cannot be an option. That's a pretty big check to write at the beginning of a category. But if you confine the segment tight enough, if the use case is important enough, the customer will lean in. They'll help you as much as they can. That's how you get through it. That's how you knock over your first bowling pin. Once you've knocked over one bowling pin, it's much easier to then expand into adjacent use cases and adjacent segments and going forward. Patrick: How do you guard against the problem of the product and the team getting overly specialized in the niche that you're attacking first, and then having it not be extensible to the other areas? Geoffrey: We call those the bowling alley forever. By the way, that's a bad outcome. It's just not a tornado outcome, because there are things that you say, well, computational fluid dynamics. I don't have it on my PC. Don't know if you have it on yours, but I'm thinking probably not. But it's a valuable thing. Computer-aided design. There's a bunch of stuff that's highly specialized. It's high value. It's ultimately at risk of getting commoditized at some point because Google Mind or Amazon something, or other will maybe make a go away at some point. But for the time being it's bowling alley forever. Bowling alley forever companies can get a really good return. They create millionaires. They don't create billionaires.",1765
248,Geoffrey Moore - Building Gorilla Businesses,Lessons from The Diffusion of Innovations," Patrick: In preparation for our discussion, I was trying to read adjacent books. I went back and reread The Diffusion of Innovations, which is one of my favorites. And two stories stood out. My reason for bringing these up is I'm about what you've learned around language and marketing messaging and the positioning in this crossing the chasm problem. And the two that stood out were, one, the scurvy example, where when scurvy was killing people on ships by the truckload, they figured out that citrus, if you had just ate some oranges, you wouldn't have this problem. But it took 200 years from that discovery to when it actually became a mandated protection, which is ridiculous. We've solved the problem. We've built it. why don't they come? There was a second rider along with Paul Revere named William Dawes who did the exact same thing, but he just hadn't built the network nodes inside the towns to have those people then go tell everyone else to raise the militia or whatever. I loved those two examples of weird little things can affect the diffusion of an innovation. How do you think about that problem of the way a message or a meme works its way through a market, and whether companies can do something about that? Geoffrey: So we see four stages in the cycle, the early market, the bowling alley, that's when you cross the chasm, the bowling alley, the tornado and main stream. And I would make the claim that foundation for messaging in each of those four stages is radically different. The challenge that technology companies have is can I migrate my mindset to keep up with the category's evolution and through the adoption life cycle? So in the early market, it's all about amazingness. If you ever listen to Marc Benioff at a Dreamforce, something is always amazing. It's that kind of stuff, amazing demos, and breakthrough, incredible, and these wonderful stories. Some of them are packed full but who cares? They're great stories. And I think it is about inspiration and creating excitement around this thing. The second set of messaging is the pragmatists don't care about you. That's the hardest thing for the entrepreneur to realize. I've just scored talking about myself for the last two years and now nobody one wants to hear about me. So what do they want to hear about? They want to talk about themself. So that second set of messaging is the other way around. This is a desktop publishing problem. This is a really tough problem. So tell me again what you have to do. And then he changed it at the last minute. And then what did you have to do? Oh my God.So you have a bunch of empathy and sort of psychological counseling after which we say, ""Well, we could actually make that problem go away. Here's what we would do."" But you bring in the solution late in the dialogue. You send out your marketing materials. It's not about what features and functions you have. It's about this horrible problem. Then in the tornado, it really is about feature function and who's going to be the gorilla and the chimp? Who's going to have the bragging rights of the thing? And so on a tornado, it is about coverage and it's about competing for budget that's in the market that year. So you'll do price discounting, you'll do feature function comparisons, anything you can do, bundling, whatever you can do to capture as much market share as you can, because that's what's going to determine your fate on mainstream. It's product centric, it's sales centric, it's coverage centric. This is when you do spiffs for your Salesforce. And this is when you're doing all this thing to just literally accelerate the transactional velocity in the category for that. Tornadoes might last anywhere from, depending on how fast the diffusion, from say three to six years, something that.It's a long time, but it's not forever. And then the fourth one is mainstream, which is now, and particularly now with the subscription model, now retention and attrition and expansion are the critical variables. And now actually customer success is actually your best connection to the customer, not your account team. You still need the account team to do the deals and do it. But your most intimate relationships are actually in your post in your customer success world. And the messaging now is about how can we help now? Here's some best practices. You share best practices across the community of install base. Here's what we're learning over here. What do you think about this? But it feels much more like an interest group on one of these social media things where we're all trying to help each other together and we've become a village. But four very different messaging platforms, if you will. Patrick: How extensible are the ideas we've talked about to non-technology businesses do you think? Geoffrey: If they're being disrupted, what's happened is like retail has been disrupted by Amazon and automobiles disrupted by Tesla. Microsoft is disrupted by cloud. And so you have all these situations where if your industry is being disrupted by a digital transformation, you have to take your thing through that life cycle. Now, what you want to do is say the relationships that we developed under the prior categorical infrastructure, we want to keep those relationships. Our strength is not technology leadership. Our strength is customer intimacy, and potentially, we had operational excellence under the old paradigm. So the problem that General Motors has is it doesn't have to be Tesla at being Tesla. It has a General Motors brand affiliation, GMC or Ford F150 truck guys. They have to see if they can move their operational excellence from a combustion engine world to an EV world. If can, the customers will stay with them. Customers don't want to change vendors. But if they can't, then they'll change vendors. Patrick: You remind me so much of my friend Alex Rampell's idea of the races between whether the incumbent can get innovation before the startup gets distribution. And it's- Geoffrey: Oh, that's perfect. Patrick: That's the perpetual race. Geoffrey: The thing that the incumbent has to realize is you don't have to leap frog the innovator. All you have to do is be good enough, fast enough. By the way, that's a really interesting challenge for an engineering route because no engineer wakes up in the morning thinking, ""Well, I want to be enough, fast enough. I'm going to be the best."" But from an incumbent's point of view, all that your customer base says is just don't miss the boat. Get on the goddamn boat. But as you know, that turns out to be a show stopper for a lot of people.",1480
249,Geoffrey Moore - Building Gorilla Businesses,How Geoffrey's Framework Has Changed," Patrick: I feel we've done a really good job of starting at the end with gorillas. And obviously that being the competitive position and the market returns position that you want to be in and this incredible life cycle and the diffusion of innovations, and these are ideas you've developed over a long, 30+ years. What have been the ideas that you're most playing with more recently? Another way of asking the question might be, what about the world has changed that make you question some of your paradigms, your frameworks for thinking or your ways of evaluating companies? What are the more recent ways that you're changing your thinking or expanding your thinking? Geoffrey: The latest book is called Zone to Win. And Zone to Win is really Crossing the Chasm for public enterprises, meaning you haven't established franchise. You're multi-billion dollars of global businesses. But the next wave is coming. And either you want to catch it first and be the first mover or more statistically, more probably, if you don't catch this wave, it's going to catch you. But in both cases, you now have to take your organization through a technology adoption lifecycle, where you're install base potentially is to trap value. So now think about that problem. ""Oh, crap. I'm General Motors. You mean my core franchise has now become the trap value?"" Not yet, but yes. And of course, if you're a publicly held company, your investors are used to having your earnings get better and better and better. And now you're going to say, ""Well actually, we're going to go through a J-curve and they're going to get worse."" The value investors say ... The first moment you hit that. So then the question can you attract growth investors to come into your world? And there's a period where frankly you're very awkward to people. It does help at that point to maybe get private equity people who get what's going on, investors that kind of specialize in this transition.But Zone to Win, so what that tells me is the first 10 to 15 years, it was all in service to startups. I mean, it was all in service in the venture world. The last 10 to 15 years, it's actually been more in service to publicly held companies because basically we can't keep reinventing the entire infrastructure. We've got to create a certain amount of renewal. We can't just have carnage. Some people’s creative destruction bleeds awful lot in this way. It would be better if these companies could catch the next wave. And similar to when spent with Salesforce and Microsoft, with Satya's team and Marc's team. And it's led to work with Intel and Cisco and companies said, ""Look, as long as you guys can keep up, you've earned our trust. We don't want to divorce and get married again. We'd to stay married."" By the way, this is a little bit like messages I get for my spouse, ""Geoffrey, you got to keep up."" Patrick: I mean, those are two such interesting companies, maybe just to double click on them, which is when you think about Microsoft, something like Azure, where AWS was first, but Azure's huge, and I think growing faster than AWS. And that's a homegrown solution. They didn't acquire another thinker, another cloud provider to build on. Whereas Salesforce has got this incredible M&A history of successful M&A, Slack more recently or whatever. What are those two models? What do they teach you about how big juggernauts can stay competitive in big emerging categories? Geoffrey: The distinction we made between them was zone defense and zone offense. So Microsoft is playing zone defense. And by the way, Microsoft historically has been maybe the best zone defense player ever. They didn't invent any of their categories. The original operating system they got from Seattle Operating System. Then it was Word Perfect, not Word. It was Lotus 1-2-3, it was not Excel. It was All THis Persuasion, it was not PowerPoint. It was Novell Network, it was not Windows NT. It was Netscape Navigator. It wasn't internet Explorer. So it's like, ""Whoa! You guys are really, really good at playing catch up."" This one goes back to, I'm trying to think how far back, maybe 2007. And I can't remember when Satya ... What happened was Ray Ozzie came in as a CTO at Microsoft and he said, ""Guys, this internet thing, it's going to disrupt you."" Well, Microsoft didn't want to listen to Ray at all. But Satya listened to Ray.And so Satya began saying, I can't remember what year it was. He said, ""Look, I'm not going to fund any R&D project going forward, net new R&D, that isn't internet centric, cloud centric."" And then when he took over, and I remembered when he took over at Microsoft, he said, ""Cloud first, mobile first."" He made it really, really clear. But that was Microsoft catching up. And I would say that most management teams in most industries are playing zone defense because that's the kind of courage you need. The zone offense tends to be founder led because only founders can voluntarily put their company in play. Elon Musk has put his company in play at least twice. It's like really? Yes, he did. Bezos. You don't my performance, sell my stock. Marc. Reed Hastings when he went from DVDs to streaming. But it's founder led. If you're not founder led, it's awful hard to say to the board of directors who hired you to manage for shareholder value, ""My intent is to reduce our shareholder value about 35%."" Patrick: Don't worry. It'll come back later. Geoffrey: Exactly. But wait, let me get to the good part. But that's very, very hard. The founder could carry in those days, but I don't think they fought very hard for it. And then of course you see, look at Facebook, which is an interesting situation. So the Google guys and Facebook guy, Marc, and those people figured out, ""Well, if we have a two tier stock system, then we can preserve our right to do Jaker,"" which is true. I'm not sure it's healthy. I think Facebook's now in a very unhealthy position, actually. I'm not sure Alphabet's in a great position either. Facebook's the one that's getting all the criticism at the moment, some of which is fair, some of which is unfair. At some point I think you graduate from you have to sort of acknowledge that you're just a citizen in the world and you can't have this private franchise that you can run solely by yourself. But we'll see, and we'll see where that goes. We'll see. Patrick: Do you have a single company that you've most enjoyed studying that you think teaches the lessons that you espouse most holistically through time that you would encourage people to go study? Geoffrey: I would say that the company that's had the most influence on me in Salesforce, but that's largely because of the personalities of the people involved. And it starts with Marc. But I mean, it's like in the middle of COVID when we have our offsite, I guess we were 45 or 50 executives in the room. I probably wanted to hug half of them. That's not a normal relationship. Consultants should not hug their clients. This is not a good idea. Doctors don't hug their patients, not normally. Part of it is I love what they do. But more importantly, I think this notion that Marc and Parker developed this thing called V2MOM, which was their little management- Patrick: Operating system manual whatever. Geoffrey: Yeah. It's called vision, values, methods, obstacles and measures. And first of all, I internalized it for myself and I watched them use it. And I thought the key to it ultimately is prioritization. And a key point you use this system to stack rank everything you do in a single order of priority. And that is incredibly powerful. The bigger the company is the more powerful it's because what it does is it tells the rest of the company where their initiatives are in this pecking order. And if you don't do that, and most executive teams just will not do it because it's like, ""Oh my God, you're more important than I am? No, I'm more important."" that kind of problem. But when you don't do it and you delegate down into the company, everybody in the middle of the company, anytime there's a conflicting priority, they got to sit together and try to negotiate, well, who comes first? And the amount of time you waste in meetings doing that is just enormous. And so the need to do that, I think is a big deal. So prioritization is what I learned from them. I also had a wonderful session with them. I mean, there was a time with John Chambers got me involved with Cisco. That was terrific. And that's where I learned about weekly commits and customer first culture. So that was a- Patrick: What's weekly commits? I've had John on the show before and we didn't talk about that. Geoffrey: Weekly commit starts as a sales tech. If you have weekly sales meeting with your team and it's well, ""Okay, so what are you going to get done?"" And you have a week to get it done. But at Cisco weekly commits infiltrated the entire thing. So every organization had this weekly commit cadences. And what was cool about a weekly commit is you couldn't get more than a week behind without it becoming visible. And if you're a consultant, you go into company after a company where things stay invisible and under the rugs, people suppress them and try not to face them, and kick cans down the road and all that kind of stuff. And so the third company I would tell an individual was when I worked with Microsoft, Qi Lu was the guy that I worked with the most. And Qi came in with the Bing acquisition, and then he ran all of office for Steve Ballmer and then for Satya, and then he moved on. But these are level five leaders who you just go, ""I would follow this person to battle anywhere."" And so I think there's an emotional side to a company, which I think has had more impact in some ways on me than maybe the intellectual side. Patrick: My second to last question then for you is inspired by that and by something you said earlier, which is one of the key ingredients is the right kind of entrepreneur, and maybe later on it's the right kind of CEO and leadership. And then you said level five leader. Maybe just riff a little bit as we wind down here on what that means to you, the emotional side of it? What has been shared in common across the exceptional leaders that you've encountered or talked to? Geoffrey: Well, it's interesting. The ability to galvanize an organization to go beyond its comfort zone. And I think there are two sources of that galvanization. I actually think that Microsoft and Salesforce are a good example of each one, where you have to do, especially as an established enterprise, but even a startup, it can't be about you. I mean, at the end of the day, it's got to be about something more important than you. So classically, the one that I think I've responded to the most are the customer-centric organization. So people say, ""Look, we have a mission in the world. We're going to do something that is going to make the world a better place and we're going to make money doing it."" And the way you galvanize that organization to get out of its comfort zone is you say, ""We're letting our customers down. We said we were going to do this in the world and we're not doing it. It's not happening. This is not okay. We have to change our behavior."" And enlist people in that mission. And people come to work to work on that mission. The other one, which is equally powerful is competitor centric. This is, ""We're not going to let those guys beat us."" And the 49ers are going to be playing the Dallas Cowboys this Sunday. We're not let those Cowboys beat us. And by the way, they're getting ahead of us and they're catching up on us.So yeah, you're in your comfort zone, but this is not okay. And I can remember, by the way, once working with HP when HP at its printer franchise, and it was just the laser printer franchise was crushing it. But the guy said to me, he said, ""For the last three years, we've crushed our plan and lost market share."" It's like, so in a competitor centric world, that's not okay. So competitor centric draws you out of yourself to beat the competitor. By the way, most athletes are inspired by the competitor model. By the way, I don't resonate very well with competitive leaders. In general, I would say most of my successful work has been with the customer-centric organizations. But I don't want to in any way diminished the power of being a competitive centric leader like a Bill Gates, a Steve Ballmer, a Scott McNealy. I mean, these people were incredibly competitive. John's more customer-centric, to be fair. Andy Grove, amazing leaders. I think you got to kind pick one to be your style. I don't think you want to stay on 50/50. Patrick: I love that. What a cool model for thinking about the leaders. Well Geoffrey, look, I've got one more question for you. But before getting to that traditional closing question, one of the things that got me inspired to spend more time in technology was your writing in your early books. So it's cool to have been able to go back and review my notes and then have this conversation with you. I encourage everyone to read, at a minimum, Gorilla Game and Crossing the Chasm and go from there. Two things that are of shaped me a lot. So I appreciate that you wrote them and shared the ideas with our audience here today. My closing question for everybody is to ask, what is the kindest thing that anyone's ever done for you? Geoffrey: Well, other than just put up with me for 53 years like my wife? No, seriously. I mean, I think if I go to business, I think the kindest thing that anybody ever did for me was, I'm 32 years old, Maria and I decide we need to live in California. I've been an English professor at Olivet College in Michigan, and we really needed to live on the west coast. So we said, ""Okay, we're going to move."" I didn't have any job. And I knew I was not going to get a job in academics because there were no openings. So I was applying for a job at a company called Rand Information Systems. A guy named Don Purr was looking for a training director. And I said, ""Look, I don't know anything about software at all, but I think I know something about training and I could do this."" And he said, ""Well, I'm going to hire you."" If you looked at my resume, any artificial intelligence thing would've been 1000 miles away. I think he just saw somebody he thought he could mentor. And he did. But that was, I think, maybe one of the kindest things. Patrick: Fantastic. Well, Geoffrey, this has been so much fun, one that I'll revisit often as I'm looking at companies and thinking about their futures. Thank you so much for your time. Geoffrey: My pleasure.

250,Gavin Baker - The Cyclone Under the Surface,Introduction," Patrick: My guest today is past guest Gavin Baker, managing partner and CIO of Atreides Management. Gavin's focus is on consumer and tech growth investing, which makes him the perfect person to discuss the blood bath we've seen in many growth equities over the past few months. We also cover inflation, semiconductors, and the disconnect between private and public markets. Please enjoy this conversation with the always great Gavin Baker.",98
251,Gavin Baker - The Cyclone Under the Surface,How Investing Feels Right Now," Patrick: So Gavin, here's our traditional every 18 month or so podcast. I'm so excited to talk to you again. Markets have changed a lot. I think the last time we talked was not maybe at the bottom, but pretty damn close to the bottom, in the beginning of COVID. Market was off 30% or something crazy like that. We sure have come a long way. If you just look at the index levels, it's been a wild, wild ride. Maybe we'll just start at the very highest level. What's it been like investing since our last conversation? How would you characterize the period relative to the rest of your career? Gavin: Well, I think 2020 was statistically probably the most alpha-rich year any active fund manager will see in their lifetime. COVID gave you such an opportunity from a valuation perspective, and then there was such massive dispersion in the relative fundamentals of different industries and companies, mostly based on whether or not you benefited from a remote work, work from home, remote schooling environment. It's hard for me to imagine you will see that kind of dispersion again. I would say for me, not to generalize, but I do think it was statistically a very hard year, 2021, for most growth-oriented fund managers, most tech-oriented fund managers. Whatever the vehicle, I think 2021 was a tough year, but it was an awesome year for the market. Patrick: Probably the reason I originally started texting last week or something was around this crazy setup where, because the largest companies have continued to do very well fundamentally and with their prices, the market's at or near all time highs and kind of has been for a long time. Meanwhile, there's complete carnage in a lot of the heavier growth parts of the market. And I think most people don't feel it because they're not focused on that growth part if you just have a broad portfolio. I don't think people appreciate how viciously bad it's been. Peloton and Zoom is like the extreme examples of high flying COVID names, but it's been brutal. So curious how it's felt for you. Gavin: Well, it's felt brutal. These are not facts. This is just kind of the way it feels. I would say probably the average tech or consumer oriented growth stock that's below a $100 billion in market cap is probably somewhere between 40 and 65% off its all time high. Some of the cases, you mentioned some of them, they're off more and the multiples have compressed by significantly more than that move. Because the underlying fundamentals have continued to grow and compound. You're not at 2001, 2002 level of crash, but it really has been a crash underneath the surface for any small midcap. Or I might even say, I lose track of what's a large cap, what's a mega cap these days, but let's just say under a hundred billion, it has been really very, very painful. The market return, particularly for the NASDAQ was really dominated by a few stocks. Google, Microsoft, Nvidia, Tesla. You just either had 50, 60% plus of your portfolio in those names, which was the right thing to do as a professional investor. Your job is to make the right decisions. But if you did not have an overwhelming allocation to those four or five names, it was a very, very hard year, which is I think why a lot of growth fund managers, whether long only or hedge fund, struggled this year, particularly relative to the NASDAQ. That's failure. It just is. Patrick: The multiple thing has been kind of the craziest thing to watch from the cheap seats. Public markets have pretty broadly diversified quantitative investor, not taking big active positions, but looking at the next 12 months revenue multiple or gross profit multiple or whatever on internet stocks and software stocks, it's a crazy round trip. You just said it, this is a job where you're evaluated very clearly on a scoreboard every year. How do you think about multiples in your investing process? A lot of people like to pay lip service to buying great businesses that compound over time, but multiple contraction expansion has been the story. So if you didn't heat it you, like you said, had a very bad year last year. So how would you describe the way that you think about multiples, what they've done and kind of where they're going? Gavin: I am an EV to free cash flow investor. I do think that if you're going to pick a single source of truth from a multiples perspective, that's at least my single source of truth. Multiples have kind of round-tripped back to, I'd say broadly speaking, 2018 levels. And I find that pretty encouraging because in 2018, the 10 year was at 3%. You were already deep, deep into a massive tightening cycle that began in 2016. And so now you have companies that are at, or in some cases well below their trough multiples from 2018. And I do find that in encouraging. But yeah, I do find it encouraging from a go forward perspective that we're already where we were or below where we were in 2018 when rates were higher, you're much deeper in a tightening cycle. And I think one thing that is missed in these analyses that you kind of see, whether in multiples today versus then, is these companies are much better. So software multiples are back to where they were in '18, but software companies today are growing faster and broadly speaking have better margins. Same thing with a lot of the internet companies. These industries have continued to mature from a cash generation perspective, but they're not really maturing from a growth perspective.Although I do think we have to really separate software and internet. I think a lot of internet companies are likely to disappoint in this upcoming earning season. There is reasonable telemetry into a lot of these stocks between app downloads, web traffic, credit card data. A lot of these companies, COVID took them to a place that was way above trend. And now that's normalizing and that's painful. Whereas software, you don't have that same dynamic. Maybe there was a little bit of pull forward, but I don't think you're going to have broad base weakness at software companies that you're going to see in a lot of these kind of midcap internet names. And by the way, God forbid some of these midcap names don't miss. Because some of them have gotten really, really, really, really cheap. Good, high quality businesses. You've got to work through this takeover, but I think software and the internet are pretty different places fundamentally, let alone semiconductors. And those are kind of the three big sub-sectors of tech. Patrick: If we had talked, I don't know, 9, 10, 11 months ago, the setup arguably would not have been nearly as good. Who knows what we would have said then. Maybe we would have thought multiples would have just continued to expand. But today, undoubtedly, like you said, they're at or below their 2018 levels. The businesses are better. So it stands to reason sort of that there's more interesting opportunity set in those set in those three major sub-sectors of semis, software and internet. I want to come back to those in a minute. Before we do that, I'd love to level set with the things in the market or the economy or the world that you're most carefully interested in and watching relative to the last time we talked, when obviously it was sort of all COVID. But the world has changed a lot since then. We're sort of settled into COVID, inflation has become a dominant theme. What are the themes that, outside of just individual companies, have your interest most, that you think most matter for general market returns from this point forward? Gavin: I think for me, inflation is the only thing that matters. And I think there's a lot of focus on the fed. To me, the fed is a little bit of a side show. I've lived through a lot of fed tightening cycles. There's a lot of great work that's been done on how equities do. Generally stocks are up, actually I think in every tightening cycle dating back something like 25 years, stocks are up 12 months after the first rate hike. By the way, the reason they're up is they generally sell off into the first rate hike because the market is anticipatory. And everybody sees these studies, things happen faster, the market is becoming even more anticipatory over time. So I think the Fed is a little bit of a sideshow, from my perspective, and what's different about this Fed tightening cycle is you just had the highest CPI print in 40 years. And I do think in terms of mistakes I made, I really under-reacted to Powell's appointment. I'm not somebody who's mindlessly bullish on growth. I'd say I was very cautious of high multiple growth stocks for probably the summer of 2020 to April, May of 2021. Wrote this big piece on Medium explaining why I was getting more positive. That was way too early. But a lot of those stocks, even back in May, their multiples that already corrected 50, 60%-plus. We digested a pretty big move in the 10 year. Powell was reappointed, clearly with a mandate to crush inflation. The market got that right. I mean, it was right away. The data Powell was appointed, that was a sea change in the market that has persisted through today. And I think just what's different is that 7% CPI number. And if you think about what drives the market, just like stocks, it just comes down to earnings and multiples. And liquidity drives the multiples and GDP growth drives earnings growth.The fed, because inflation is at 7%, I think that's why this selloff has been so severe. Just because this is different than anything any professional, I mean, maybe there's some people. I guess Warren Buffett was investing in 1982, okay. Maybe there are a couple of people who were professional investors in active investors in 1982, but not many. So as a bottoms-up investor, you do kind of have to be macro-aware. And I think there's two parts to inflation. The first one is supply chain driven, the shortage of goods everybody's read about. Ships stacked up the port, we can't get enough semiconductors to make cars. I am so relaxed about that. It is very rare for me to have a view on something like that. I just think we now have hundreds of years of history and capitalism is amazing at solving problems. It is so good. And we have seen a massive supply response. This is a statistic, I actually just ran this this morning. Amazon has spent more money on capex, and this is just illustrative, it's not a comment on Amazon. It's a comment on the supply response. They have spent more money on capex in the last two years than they did in the preceding 20 years. Patrick: Insane. Gavin: Think about that. From 1999 to they spent 62 billion on capex. They're going to spend 87 billion in 2020 and 2021. Patrick: That is crazy. Gavin: That's unimaginable. And no, I did not go through and nerdily adjust every year for capitalized leases. And maybe it makes it more striking, maybe it makes it less striking, but either way it's crazy. Taiwan City, their 2022 capex is going to be many multiples of 2018. 2021 and 2022, they'll spend more than they did in the preceding five years. So there is a massive supply response coming. We know that the economy is slow. We know it from credit card data, retail sales, which a couple of reports here have 16% for the year. They're flat in November, down two in December. And then the Atlanta Fed does this thing they called the GDP now. And that was ten in November, five in December. So the economy is slowing rapidly. So you've got this massive supply response, an economy rapidly slowing before the fed begins to take away the punch bowl. I think you're about to have a truly massive shift in consumer spending away from goods towards services. If you trend out and look at real personal expenditures, goods spending is roughly 500 billion above the pre-COVID trend line. Services spending is 500 billion below the trend line. And that shift, Omicron is probably the end of COVID, to me as a factor for investing for daily life. So I do think the economy will finally normalize. So when you have this supply response, meaning a slowing economy and a shift away from goods towards services, then I just think all of that inflation goes away.Goldman did this analysis. Auto is accounted for half of the overshoot in core inflation, used auto prices. They were kind of flat for forever and then they went up 50% in 18 months. All that goes away. Maybe it doesn't, want to be appropriately humble, but I think highly likely that all that is going to go away. If it doesn't go away, wow, okay, I'm going to be horribly, horribly wrong. And I do think this post-World War II period is an interesting analog for this. You had a 20% CPI basically, because there was huge boom, factories, really good at making takes and fighter jets and not good at making anything else. There was a supply response and CPI went right back down. And so I think for that component, that is for sure going to normalize. And I think the other thing is wage inflation. And this is something where there are things happening in the economy that have literally never happened before. Like the ratio, there's more unemployed people looking for work than there are job openings. Now there's more job openings than there are people looking for work. The ratio of job openings to unemployed hit an all time high. Something happened that's never happened before. I think it's important to think about it with an open mind and it's like, okay, why has this happened?Well point number one, we had massive stimulus since the New Deal. And on top of that, we had a debt jubilee. And I don't think we really fully understand how powerful that debt jubilee was. We basically said, ""You don't have to pay rent."" Student loan forgiveness, eviction moratoriums, all this stuff. You had all of that. You had people, lot of people over the age of 62 left the workforce. And I think part of that is people probably took these voluntary buyouts that companies, I'm sure they wish they had not given in the spring of 2020, that I do think you have give people credit for being rational. I think the idea of getting COVID is much scarier if you're over 60 than if you're under 40. Sad to say I'm over 40. So you had a lot of people retire. And then I also think you had a lot of people who, because of remote learning, a lot of two income households went to one income households. All of that is normalizing. The debt jubilee is over, stimulus is fading, consumer savings are beginning to draw down. I do think after Omicron, kids are going to be able to sustainably go back to school. So a lot of that stuff is fading, but really, really who knows. And if wage inflation is here to stay, I think it means very bad things for the market. It's just that simple. I think on balance, it's probably not here to stay. These forces of globalization, they're too powerful. I'm not sure that the idler movement is here to stay. It's one thing to be an idler while you have a debt jubilee and, and a lot of savings. It's another thing when you burn all of that down.But I just think it's important to be humble. Anytime you're talking about forecasting the future, you want to be humble. People have been trying to do it for thousands of years unsuccessfully. And at the end of the day, that is what fundamentally investing is. You are forecasting the future. You have a differential opinion on the future, full stop. People don't like to admit that, but that is what it is. As hard as that is to do for individual companies, it's way harder to do for entire economy, which is the world's most complex chaotic system, high sensitivity to initial conditions, unpredictable interactions. Everything I'm saying, I want to caveat with that. I don't know if I've given you my two examples before, Patrick, and feel free to stop me if I have, but I always think about the Federal Reserve, they employ more PhD economists than anyone. They have more information on the economy than anyone, like way more information than anyone. They have vast amounts of computing power, and they have no ability to forecast the economy out more than six months. And so A, I'm way less smart. B, I have way less information, certainly have less computing power. So there was a letter written, an op-ed written in the Wall Street Journal somewhere in between 2010 and 12. And I think a majority of the world's PhD economists signed it. Every famous macro-investor you can think of signed it, but it basically said, ""Hey Ben Bernanke, you have no idea what you're doing. This quantitative easing is going to cause massive inflation. It's going to ruin America. You're going to bring about hyperinflation. It's going to be the ruin of America."" They were dead wrong, horribly wrong. Patrick: I remember that op-ed really well. And it's such a good point to like caveat that this stuff is incredibly hard to predict, but I think maybe even more interesting is, let's just assume it comes to pass. So predicting it's one thing, but the impact is another that maybe we can explain more coherently than we can forecast the future. And I'm just curious how you think about the ways in which wage inflation is bad for the market. It seems at a top level kind of obvious, but maybe it's not obvious and maybe there's a lot of nuance behind how you think about it. So just walk us through that. Why, on average, should it be bad for stocks if there's a lot of wage inflation? Gavin: So it is very, very simple. And I've written about this. The best thinking about this comes from Buffett, and it is first principles thinking. So Buffett and Charlie Munger, if you listen to what they say, a lot of it is basically a long term return of an equity should approximate its return on equity. Which makes sense for a lot of reasons, mostly having to do with reinvestment, simple DuPont equation. And so then you could think of, today we would say ROIC, not ROE. And Warren Buffett wrote this amazing article in the 1970s that is by far the best thinking I've ever read on why inflation is bad for the stock market. And the reason it is bad for the stock market, and you kind of go back to the DuPont formula, is that inflation, let's just say everybody just takes price increases in line with whatever their input costs are. So their margins stay the same, but inflation ultimately inflates your asset base, and so that depresses your ROE or your ROIC. So thereby you expect your return goes down. And it's even worse because at some level, what you really care about as an equity investor is the gap between the ROE or the ROIC of your portfolio, your equity portfolio, relative to the yield on government bonds. So that obviously gets way worse in an inflationary environment. That actually gives me a great deal of comfort about secular growth and technology, and I think it's probably one reason I am right now as bullish... And I'm sure I'm early, always early. I'm addicted to the 52 week low list, okay? I cannot stop myself from buying weakness. I almost always have a negative exposure to momentum. I'm wired differently in some ways than a lot of other growth investors.I always buy early, I always sell early, and I wish I weren't that way, but I am. 100% I'm early. But I do think if you think about that from first principles, everyone does this analysis. They look back to the 1970s and tech was one of the worst performing sectors in the seventies. Well, tech companies in the seventies had nothing to do with tech companies today. They were asset heavy companies, they made stuff, they had relatively low gross profit dollars per employee. And I do think that is a metric to really focus on, revenue and gross profit dollar and free cash per employee. And so of course they did badly in this Buffett framework. Today tech companies, they're super asset light, they have the highest ROICs, they have massive pricing power, got probably broadly speaking as a sector, the lowest of employees per dollar gross profit or free cashflow. I don't think tech will perform going forward the way it did in the seventies. And I think from a first principles perspective, some of the companies that invest, I'm not mindlessly bullish on tech, I go through periods where I'm so cautious on tech and growth. But today I would say I'm as bullish as I've ever been on these names that are down 60 to 70%, where in some cases the estimates continue to be revised up, you're trading at multiples below where you were back in 2018. And look, if we do have persistent wage inflation, all equities are in a world of paying, but just on a relative basis, I think from here looking out 12 to 18 months, a lot of these midcap tech names are going to be a reasonably good place to be relative to the market. The only caveat I would add is I do have a big bias towards the ones that generate free cash flow.And I think one thing that's actually happening today and a little bit last week for the first time, it used to be correlation one, selloffs. Every name over each 10 or 15 times even sales was down the same amount. Well, you're seeing the market differentiate today and starting last week around free cashflow, because some of these names are at two or three or 4% free cash yield looking out to 2023. And that's very different than if you're still burning cash in '23. So I do think that's an encouraging thing to decide, but look, if wage inflation is here to stay, basically there are these two calculations that everybody does to make them feel better about rates. One is what it will do to the American consumer if rates go significantly above the average mortgage rate, because you do have all these adjustable mortgages that reset, it will almost semi automatically cause a massive recession. So people think that's one governor. Other governor of course is the fact that the US government at the end of the day, is at some level in control of all of this, they're running a massive deficit. So by raising rates, they're raising their own borrowing costs. I think everybody looks at those things and thinks, ""Oh, well, the 10 year can't go above two and a half or 2.75 or 3.25."" Everybody does these calculations in different ways. My point is, all those calculations go out the window if wage inflation is here to stay. I think you could have more pain for equity markets if wage inflation is here to stay and all these ROEs begin to compress. But I do feel reasonably okay about these mid-cap grown tech names. You've already taken the pain on the multiple, the terminal value, now you're in many cases back to a pretty reasonable place. Their relative fundamentals should be the best and in short timeframes because of the economy slowing and everything we talked about. And in short 12 to 18 month timeframes, relative fundamentals generally drive relative performance.",5111
252,Gavin Baker - The Cyclone Under the Surface,Semiconductors and Software," Patrick: I'd love to dive in a little bit, just underneath that big trend, you mentioned the three sub-sectors of semis, software, internet. Maybe we could also talk about a fourth category, which is the big five or the big 10 technology companies that are conglomerates at this point. Maybe we'll start with semis. I've talked to you about this in the past, I'm just totally fascinated by the semiconductor industry. I know this is where you cut your teeth a lot, followed it since its beginning and since the start of your career. A lot of people had never heard of Taiwan Semiconductor two years ago. And I think a lot more people have now, for a variety of reasons, not just the shortages and the importance of supply chain, but also the geopolitical stuff. Walk us through your take on semis today and what's evolved and what matters in that subsector in tech, since it's such a key one? Gavin: Let's step back and look at the last 15 years of semis. The industry has completely consolidated to where you almost have these monopolies - monopolies or duopolies in every subsector of semis. You either have a monopoly, duopoly, or in the worst case, an oligopoly of three. And in even their suppliers to capital equipment companies, they're all either monopolies to duopolies. So the industry has massively consolidated over the last 15 to 20 years in a way that maybe should have never been allowed to happen. Although the fact is that a lot of these markets, for a lot of reasons, mostly because the network effects around software code and then economies of scale, they do tend toward being a monopoly, a monopoly or duopoly. So in basebands, there's a duopoly. CPUs, there's a duopoly. GPUs, there's a duopoly, now it's an oligopoly because intel is entering that industry. Memory, it's oligopoly for for both NAND and DRAM, analog almost part by part, it's generally a duopoly, same thing for FPGAs. So it's a very consolidated, concentrated industry. And you have had demand, I think structurally shift up. And this has always been a secular growth industry, it's always grown, I call between 1.5 to low twos, multiple of GDP, global GDP. So it's always been a secular growth industry, but that multiplier's shifted up. And the reason it's shifted up is broadly speaking because of artificial intelligence. Human beings, when they write software code, they make a big effort to minimize their, at least good programmers do, use of resources like compute and memory. You used to have to have a budget you had to work with before the dates of cloud computing, only so much memory and only so much storage. The way of cloud computing has thrown that all out the window. And AI is just the inverse. The way you make AI better is you train it on more data. That's it.It's really just that simple. And there's just a really good rule of thumb, and Microsoft wrote about this in a research paper 10 years ago, or maybe not, 12 years ago, the quality of a given AI algorithm doubles with every 10X increase in the amount of data you used to train that algorithm. And Mark Edrison wrote this op-ed, whatever it was, 10 years ago about how software is eating the world, now AI is eating software. And that just means that the world is getting much, much more compute and semiconductor intensive. And then on top of that, you have all these, at the end of the day, cars are a massive, massive consumer market. And as those become EVs the next AVS, the semiconductor content for car is really exploding. And you put those two things together, the world is just becoming a lot more semiconductor intensive. The bummer, and I would say I'm probably as cautious as I've been on semiconductors in a long time right now, it's still a cyclical industry. If you look at the history in the industry in the eighties and nineties, you have these capacity cycles and they're driven by the fact that, God I can't remember his last name, but he was hilarious, TJ, he ran Cypress Semiconductor, he famously said real men own fabs, because there was this trend of going fab-less. But it used to be, in the eighties and nineties, if you ran out of capacity, well, the only thing you could do was build a new fab. And everybody would tend to run out of capacity at the same time, so all these fabs would come them on at the same time. And so you could think of demand as being the smooth, underlying, true demand, the relatively smooth line, and then capacity comes on in the stair step path.So you would have these vicious cycles, and companies were always going out of business, but then the world moved to fab-less with few exceptions. Today, Intel, Samsung, Taiwan Semi, they're the are only companies in the world that can make leading edge logic. There's only three companies that can make leading edge DRAM, maybe four for NAND. And so they got much better about aggregating capacity smoothly. And as a result of that, the cycles you've seen last 20 years are just inventory cycles. And the reason for that is the fundamental equation that covers semis is customer inventories must equal lead times. Because if they don't, and you're purchasing manager, you get fired. Okay? And so whatever lead times are, that is what customer inventories are. And that leads to this crazy positive feedback loop where if lead times are going up, inventories are building, which causes lead times to go up, which causes inventories to build further. And then as soon as something changes, all that unwinds. And then lead times are going down, you're burning inventories. So if you're a semiconductor company, you're never seeing true in demand. You're either seeing above market demand because lead times are going out and inventories are building, or below market demand, or below true in demand. And so you've had these inventory cycles really consistently for the last 20 years.What you have right now is, I think a massive inventory cycle. And everything we talked about, the economy slowing even before the fed hikes hit, PCEs shifting away from goods towards experiences. I think demand for semis is almost inevitably going to decelerate a little and that's going to lead to an unwind of this inventory cycle. And then all the capacity that's being brought on probably makes it worse. But then I think, you get to the other side of that, and you're left with that industry that used to grow at 2X nominal GDP to one that probably now is a 3X nominal GDP grower. And you still have that super consolidated supply structure. You're now having people saying semiconductor companies should be valuing software companies. And no, they shouldn't. You have a bunch of people. Every fund I know that's under 50 billion is frantically looking for a semiconductor analyst, where somebody's really good at semis, have a lot of tourist to the sector. And it's just when these companies miss, they miss big. Just going back to the fourth quarter of 2018, you can see some really, really, really big misses. So I would say relatively cautious on semis. Patrick: Last time we talked, I think there was a big question about how secure these incredible retention numbers and net dollar your numbers were for software companies in the depths of COVID. Curious how you're thinking there has changed. Just use Zoom as the obvious example of just insane run up and now insane run down, the fundamentals of the business are pretty amazing as we've all adopted it, we're talking on it right now. Talk me through your views on software and the rollercoaster that it's been on. Gavin: Yeah. Well, first I have to say, mea culpa, I was wrong. Predicting the future being very, very hard. I think last time I was on your podcast, I said something to the effect of, ""Software is not going to be better than firstly debt."" Well, I was wrong. Software was better than firstly debt, it just was really across the board. So I was really, really wrong. And today I think now you're looking at, I do have this bias for companies that are generating cashflow. That's a big line in the sand for me. And there's a huge difference to me when I look at a company over 10 times sales, over 15 times sales, between having a two, two and a half, 3% free cash flow yield, looking out to '23, and a company that's still burning cash. I'm really, really bullish on software. It is particularly in a world of slowing growth, which I do think for sure we are for, it's the consumer staple of tech. It should have the best fundamentals. In a lot of ways. Their fundamentals should be more stable than even staples. I'm really, really positive on it, I do have a bias, I would say towards infrastructure companies relative to application software companies. There are a lot of application software companies that don't have a lot of true technology.And I do think they're a little bit at risk from, as it gets easier and easier and easier in the cloud to build your own applications, use your own data, not share it. It used to be, the CIOs were scared of going to the cloud because they thought they'd lose all their budgets, they'd lose being able to fly around on the corporate jet and go to the super bowl or whatever it was. Their nominal excuse was security. And then a couple of high profile hacks, and everybody realized it was more of a risk to not be in the cloud than to be in the cloud from a security perspective. But now I think you really can, at these big cloud vendors, similarly, everybody thought IT services were going to be destroyed. These it services companies reporting record quarters, record backlogs, it's great for them. And the reason is, now if you're that CIO at a Fortune 50 company, you can and build your own apps, control your own data. It's way easier than it ever was. At the end of the day, that is what a lot of these CIOs want to do. So I do have a big bias towards infrastructure software that rides on top of these cloud computing giants. Patrick: Is that true in terminal value too? So if you just look at, I don't know, the top 10 or 15 software companies, most of them are still application heavy or dominant, Salesforce, Adobe, Intuit, lots of companies like this, Activation Blizzard, which got bought today by Microsoft, which we should riff on and have fun with. But it does seem very app heavy still at the top end of the market cap spectrum. Whereas some of these companies are still private, but the stripes of the world, the Twilio's of the world, the cloud providers, the data dogs, all these kinds of companies that are more infrastructure focused are still up and coming. How do you think about the end state of all this? Does that opinion of yours extend beyond just the current opportunity set to some future state where infrastructure is dominant? Gavin: For sure extends to a future state. And it is definitionally a belief that, at some level, and I do think Google was the first cloud to say, ""Okay."" Marc Benioff would tell this parable about AWS and diligent software companies about how they just couldn't help themselves. And it was the parable of the scorpion and the elephant. The elephant crossed a raging river that's flooded and the scorpion has to get across it, there's a fire, a flood behind it. And the scorpion says, ""Hey, will you take me across, Elephant? Because I'll die otherwise."" And the elephant is like, ""Yeah, sure. I want to be nice. How do I trust you that you're not going to sting me to death?"" The Scorpion's like, ""Well, if I sting you to death, I'm going to die. And then we'll both die. So of course I'm not going to do that."" And then the elephant's like, ""Okay, get on my back,"" Scorpion gets on its back. They're going across the river. And the scorpion stings the elephant and the elephant's like, ""Why'd you do that?"" As they're both dying. And the scorpion says, ""It's in my nature, I couldn't help it."" Patrick: I love that. Gavin: Yeah. So Benioff tells that story about how, don't let AWS diligence your company, because they cannot help themselves. They're not going to buy you, they're going to try and build. You've seen them try to build their own- Patrick: It happened with Elastic Search, I think it's happened a bunch of times. Gavin: Exactly. Yeah. Many, many times. Where they try and force the open source infrastructure, build it themselves. And Google was the first one to realize like, ""Hey, this is silly. There's a lot of innovation happening outside of us. B, there's a lot of money to be made just in providing these primitives. Let's stop trying to compete with these independent infrastructure software providers right on top of the cloud. They could be a channel for us, they can drive demand for us."" And by the way, a lot of these companies now are also very important and strategic because some of them have on-prem businesses too. And on-prem just means private cloud now. You make it easier for these companies to migrate to the public cloud if you embrace the same infrastructure software that they're using in their own data centers. But I do think it is a little bit of a view that, ""Hey, the world of software is not just going to be AWS, GCP and Azure. They're not going to go up the stack and consume every infrastructure function."" That is a view. And do think it's interesting, you touched on terminal value. But broadly speaking, this view that these app providers who have a traditional enterprise go to market and they just have a pretty UI and a lot of Oracle and SAP salespeople selling a product that replaces a spreadsheet or whatever it is, those terminal multiples, or multiples today are much lower. I don't think the market understands that this is a risk.But yeah, you for sure have to believe that the world of software is not going to be an oligopoly, and I believe that. And I think AWS is the last one that's slowly giving up on this. GCP was the first to embrace it, then Azure. And if Azure is embracing these third party infrastructure software providers, everybody is, because they have more software capability than anyone. And then the other interesting thing is, I don't own any of these, but if you are going to own an application software company, I have a bias towards one that SMBs. Because those SMBs are not going to be able to roll their own apps in AWS. So they're shielded from that. Cybersecurity, that's another thing, I was open minded in this, but I was always structurally bearish on cybersecurity because cybersecurity is the area of the market, it was always easiest to go from zero to $1 billion. But basically, it was previously impossible to go over $15 billion to $20 billion. And the reason was success sowed the seeds of your own destruction, because the attackers would start to optimize for you. The VCs knew this. They were always funding competitors. In size and scale it was one of the only areas of tech where it hurt you rather than helped you. Well, AI has changed that. Now that attack surface, if your models are learning, if you're truly an AI-driven cybersecurity company, scale is good for you. And that's why for the first time ever for a long time, I forget the exact numbers, but you never had a cybersecurity outcome over $20 billion. Now you have companies that have blown through that, still going fast from a market value perspective. And a similar thing for this is how big an independent could get before they collapse under their own weight. So AI's really changed cybersecurity. Patrick: The last category to touch on briefly, recent news is an excuse to talk about a few other things and then maybe talk about a couple other fun topics before we close. The first is the difference between internet and software, if those are two separate categories. It gets kind of obvious what defines the difference, but maybe define the difference in a little more detail how they trade the variables that matter, your view on them today. Say a bit more about internet specifically as a category. Gavin: Well, I'd say there's broadly speaking three kinds of internet companies, and one in a lot of ways is software companies. So the three kinds of internet companies are e-commerce companies, advertising companies, and then subscription companies, like Netflix and Spotify. And I would just say definitionally, e-commerce and advertising are way more GDP sensitive than software, so they're feeling this slowdown that's happening right now in the economy. And on top of that, they're suffering a COVID hangover. Software is not. Price always leads to invented narratives. So now that software has been weak there's all this, ""Oh, MuleSoft was weak and they're a leading indicator because API integrations..."" No, this is an invented narrative. But there is real, legitimate fundamental weakness in almost all of the internet names, maybe with the exception of search. And that's just because probably search is the only part of the internet that is levered to this resurgence and services spending. So you see pretty broad based. Maybe if I say this on the podcast somebody will do this. In my mind, I always just look at software companies, the subscription internet companies, any franchise business model, and any data business model.They're all the same to me. They have recurring revenues, they have pricing power, and it's interesting to think about the relative fundamentals, the relative ROICs, and the relative valuations. There's not a lot of differences. If you're a franchised restaurant or hotel company, you just have a royalty. Now, it's economically sensitive royalty, but it's a royalty. You're very asset light. People have effectively setups for subscriptions with overage. In that respect franchisers, they look more like a NextGen software company that doesn't sell contracts, but they sell on consumption. Which is good when it's working for you, but then when it stops working for you, you wish you had those contracts. But I would just say internet, broadly speaking, is just suffering from a COVID hangover, that it doesn't appear software is. I mean, J.P. Morgan just came out and said, ""We're in a panic to go to the cloud. We're going to spend way more money than anyone thought."" And I think you're going to see 2022 be that kind of investment year from a lot of companies. And by the way, there's all sorts of surveys that support this from CIOs.",4156
253,Gavin Baker - The Cyclone Under the Surface,The Metaverse and Other Trends," Patrick: Maybe a couple recent events to just talk about, some favorite topics. I'll start with the change of Facebook's name to Meta and just the entire metaverse trend. I think the way that you and I originally got to know one another was talking about sci-fi, and I know sci-fi has played a huge role in your sticking with tech in the early part of your career and just your interest in tech technology, generally speaking. Important to remember, I can't remember who said it, that a lot of the sci-fi novels with a metaverse, it was dystopian not utopian. But talk to me about the metaverse. I mean, it's such a huge topic that I've done some episodes on. People are fascinated by this idea. It's a big idea. One of the biggest companies in the world is betting on it in a major way. What's been your reaction to the all of a sudden everyone knowing what the metaverse is, and caring? Gavin: Well, I feel embarrassed to use the word now. It would be like- Patrick: Yeah, it is annoying. Gavin: I like to be early and nerdy. When you have, I don't know, consumer products companies say, ""We're going to have our own metaverse and we're going to do this,"" it feels a little overdone to me, but it's still real, it's still coming. I'm excited for the PlayStation VR headset. I'm excited to see what Apple does. Meta is going to keep going, keep iterating. It's just this trend that's going to continue until we all have brain computer interfaces and we can just close our eyes and, whatever, be an elven warrior or do whatever I want to do. And so I still really, really believe in it. And by the way, I would say that's another thing I've been wrong about. To me, the only real metaverses today, what are they? Well, there's a military metaverse and it's pretty much dominated by Call of Duty. There's too cartoony, friends-feebly, kids-friendly metaverses, Roblox and Fortnite. Then there's fantasy metaverse, and that's World of Warcraft. And these really are metaverses where commerce happens, people live their lives. You've got your science fiction metaverse, that's Destiny. I spend a lot of time in that. You still got to play that Patrick. But those stocks, A, it hasn't, I would say broadly speaking, really filtered through to their fundamentals and/or their prices. But I do still think that in terms of where are metaverses, well they're video games and these are real metaverses today. But yeah, the metaverse, I think it's still coming. Patrick: And do you think that, to use the other headline of the day, Activision joining Microsoft, is a lot of this just about wanting to own the place where people spend their digital time and fundamentally that's just the arc of that bends towards active participation, which means video games versus social networks or Netflix or streaming entertainment? How do you think about the long arc of this trend and why it seems like the big technology companies all of a sudden need to have a metaverse strategy? And I don't know if that's what Microsoft's doing with Activision, but it sure seems interesting. How do you think about that? Gavin: Yeah, it is for sure I think what is happening with Microsoft and Activision. It's why they bought Bethesda Fallout. The Elder Scrolls online, those are also little metaverses. That's why they bought Minecraft. That's another kid-friendly metaverse that I should have thrown in with Fortnite and Roblox. Microsoft, it's just interesting because of their HoloLens contract, they're almost certainly going to have the most pure AR/VR revenue of any company. They control this video gaming platform. Almost all PC gaming happens on Windows PCs and I think they're slowly trying to bring that back away from Steam. And then they have all these great first party video games. So I think they have a very interesting collection of assets. All those companies, I just think of them, they're just levered royalties on global GDP. You could almost do a cohort analysis and it's so bullish for all of those companies taking on Netflix. Netflix is for sure at some level a levered royalty on global GDP and consumer free time. If you think about the internet not advertising with cloud or computing companies, it's like, if you just bracket companies by the year that they were created, I bet companies that were created 50 years ago, I bet their spending... I don't know, I'm going to make this up, 2% of their total revenue on either advertiser or cloud computing with those companies. If you're a company that was created in the last three years, a good case is you're only spending 50% of your revenue with those companies. That's a great case. Every year, the world moves towards them.So if semiconductors grow at 3X GDP, they may collectively grow at a higher multiple of that, and they certainly have the last 10 years, but that may continue as long as... They could be broken up, TikTok. Unless you have a real paradigm shift, a platform shift, that levered royalty on global GDP is going to continue supported by that cohortive analysis that I just described. And that is why they're also focused on the metaverse. Everybody wants to own the next platform. Everybody thinks the metaverse is the next platform. Everybody's working on it. And I go back to our first podcast, I think it's going to be Apple and Android with some pretty profound advantages because they control the platform that's in everybody's pocket. And ultimately, the metaverse, we're probably going to want it to be portable and VR and AR are going to move and fuse into XR extended reality. It's hard not to see how the dominant mobile operating systems aren't advantaged. And by the way, that is something exciting because I do think it means like, ""Hey, you want to play in the metaverse? You probably need a mobile operating system."" So I think you're going to see some of these companies start to collide. Like Apple's going to do search. They're eventually going to do it. I think you'll see more mobile OS competition. Some of these ecosystems will collide in ways that are interesting. Patrick: One of the things I don't think you and I have talked about is the impact of all of this on those companies that were founded 50 years ago and are spending the 2% or whatever it is on these modern platforms. How do you think about that opportunity, both as an investor and for businesses, to bring the 2% to 20% or 30%, or whatever? Gavin: I think it's pivotal. When I was cautious on secular growth from, call it summer of 2020 to spring of 2021, I was very focused on cheap consumer cyclicals that I thought had really structurally and durably improved their business models. And I think there's a lot of retailers or brands that did that. And by the way, there's so many phases you go through. On a long enough timeline, every internet company sells ads. Well, all these retailers, they're going to start selling ads online. There's so much still in front of them from a becoming a modern internet business, I just don't think there's a lot of opportunity. And I would say for retailers that are on the right side of change, broadly speaking, I'm still very excited about a lot of those businesses. Probably now much more excited about something like software than I am about those. But I don't think they're going back to being perma-shorts that they were. And I think there's a lot of people who reflexively just want to short retailers, but a lot of these retailers, they are here to stay. They do have big online businesses, integrated their store network with their e-commerce operations in really cool ways. And by the way, this is what Bezos was worried about for 20 years, buy online, pick up in store. All the world's largest e-commerce companies, they're opening stores like stores have value, but if they're really well integrated with the modern IT system.By the way, in the context of software, I do think it's important to realize there is a crazy underlying private equity bid for these assets. It will put a floor under it. Thoma Bravo, they just raised a $20 billion fund. There is a lot of dry powder on the sidelines. And by the way, Patrick, and another point I just want to make about value versus growth that I think is so important, every time growth starts to underperform there are a lot of people who are like, ""Oh my God, this is amazing. It's the bubble crashing. We're going to go back to the way it was for value from '01 to '08. The glory days are here again. It's amazing."" And by the way, like I said I'm not always bullish on growth. I was tilted very, very value-heavy for nearly the year. But I think what's missing from that analysis, going back to the two components, what drives stock returns, multiples and earnings. The reason value was so good after the tech bubble burst wasn't just that multiples expanded, but it was that earnings exploded. Why did earnings explode? Because you had Jim O'Neill, the bricks, the crickets, you had post China entering the WTO. You had just this massive industrialization in China that was a true step function in demand for oil, for iron, or for every material you could think of. They were building so many airports, they were buying so many airplanes, cars, everything.And that was really what drove it. And I think sometimes people miss that is, there was a massive, massive, fundamental upshift in demand that drove so many of these value stocks in that period. I don't see that today. So even when I think of a higher inflation world where you have wage inflation, it's like, I just don't see any comparable demand impulse for a lot of these traditional smokestack industries like you had with the bricks during the '00s. You meet with these Australian and South American giant companies, but it's like, we're not sure there's enough iron or in the world. Forget peak oil, which was a popular theory. We were worried about peak everything. And well, it turns out the Earth is a big place and it really was a one-time build. I think maybe the first time we were on we discussed, one reason value investing has been hard is that algorithms, they do have career risk, they just don't know it. They don't care. They don't feel emotion. That career risk that people would talk about being with value investing like, ""That's gone?"" But also, for sure this crazy demand impulse, I just don't see anything like that.",2382
254,Gavin Baker - The Cyclone Under the Surface,Mismatch Between Public and Private Markets," Patrick: There's two interesting points that that makes me think of, and I know we want to talk about this, so it's a great excuse to do so. One is the impact of private markets on all of this. Demand is one thing on the side of the companies, it's another thing on the side of the equity for people that want to invest in these companies. And you've got just incredible $20 billion funds being raised. You've got this crazy disconnect, which is really what I'd like to hear your view on, between private market multiples, even late stage ones, and public market multiples, even recently IPOed ones. So it seems like this weird handoff where you go from private to public and your valuation drops by a bunch. What's driving that and how do you think all of this will affect the private equity, both private equity in the sense of later stage buyouts, but also early stage venture? What do you see unfolding here, because there does seem to be this weird mismatch right now? Gavin: So I think at a high level what is happening, if you're an allocator you want the highest Sharpe ratio asset you can have. What's been the highest Sharpe ratio asset for a long time now? Anything private. The reason is, is because they don't mark to market. I promise you, private equity funds and venture capital funds and everybody else mark to market. In other words, if every venture capital firm sent out a thing being like, ""Here's your statement. Because the multiples of these mid-cap tech companies are down 60%, we're marking ourselves down 40%,"" that would change a lot of things. That's not going to happen. And so what has happened is, it used to be there was a liquidity premium. Now there is an illiquidity premium. This is even at individual fund level. If you're a mutual fund and you're in a big complex and you get access to privates, and you have 5% of your assets and privates that are marked monthly or quarterly, you're going to have a higher Sharpe ratio than your competitors who only do publics. There is for sure, and I'm not saying it's rational, there is an illiquidity premium. And that is just a fact and I don't see it changing. It's what the entire system wants. The entire system wants less frequent marks. The entire system, savings and retirement, needs bigger and bigger private markets in which to deploy capital.So you could get these, they are smooth, 20%, 30% IRRs. So I think this illiquidity premium is here to stay. I don't think the world is going back. Two things, one, illiquidity premium goes away when you become liquid. But you do have to eventually become liquid, so that is the ultimate governor on this. Public multiples are the ultimate reality. And at the end of the day, if public market weakness or strength persists for six to nine months... I promise you, this weakness persists, private valuations will cool off. They just will. I've been doing venture for 20 years. This is a very consistent relationship. And by the way, and then when publics start to recover, it'll take the venture valuations a while to recover. It's like, there are all these great opportunities, even into the summer of 2020, where you can make venture investments at the March, 2020 low just because the venture market is slower to adjust both up and down. But ultimately the public market does really lead and inform venture valuations, because how could it not? Patrick: One of the stats that is staggering is the percentage of exits for these venture funded firms that are strategic acquisitions versus IPOs. It used to be all IPOs, now it's dominated by strategic acquisitions, which puts yet more opacity around it somehow. Twilio by Segment, you never really get to learn a lot about Segment, or maybe much later once it's a bigger Segment of Twilio, but it's this interesting lack of marks all the way up and down is what the system wants. I love how you put that. It makes me wonder how you think then the competitive landscape a venture will evolve. Since you and I both do a lot of private technology investing, obviously we're super interested parties here. What do you think will drive success or failure amongst those style of investors given this playing field? Gavin: The world of venture is being unbundled and rearchitected at an incredible rate. It's happening in many different ways. So I would say, to me there will be four market participants. There are angel investors. And these are really, really important because it used to be if you were an entrepreneur or a founder, you would really thoughtfully construct your board and you'd want a go-to market expert from this firm, and then you'd want a technology expert from this firm, and then maybe an ops expert from this firm. Now you just get three angels, do all that for you, and you put them in at the very beginning.I had a stunning conversation with a Series A raising money, and I was like, ""Hey, I do think that makes sense."" A lot of seed and A and Series B investors, they have magical skills that I will never have around helping you build your company. And while they add a lot of value, he's like, ""No, but I can get that from angels."" However much you get. In other words, his point was, ""I can take money from whoever I want. I do not need a value-add investor because I get value from my angels."" And they had thought about them very carefully. So I thought that that was really, really interesting. Angels are a big, big part of this and here to stay.And then I think there's the seed through B specialists, and these are I think a lot of the great traditional firms. And here, man, to play here you really do have to add value. You must add value to have a franchise here. What those seed through B firms, in my mind they're just credentializing agencies. They add value, but they also credentialize the company of the founder for later investors. They're like Harvard. And man, that's a great business. It's good to be Harvard, it's very good to be one of these really, really dominant early stage investor. And then I think the rest of the world is going to be these really big multi-stage investors. I think ultimately everybody's going to be a crossover investor. To compete with crossover investors, you must be a crossover investor. Otherwise, they have a superior mouse trap. It's such a powerful value proposition to a founder to say, ""Hey, we're never going to sell, we're going to buy more on your IPO and we can own you for 20 years."" That's so powerful. I think this competitive pressure is why Sequoia, arguably, whether they're the best, they're one of the three best venture investors. Okay. They converted to effectively being a crossover investor. Then I think if you're not one of those three buckets, it's going to be very, very, very hard. I think this is cool because it is going to put ... By the way, I think that this is a better setup for LPs too. I should just say everything I'm about to say comes from my friend and mentor Antonio Gracis, who I really hope goes on the podcast sometimes soon- Patrick: We'll scheduling, I think. Yep. Gavin: Yes, but Antonio's one of my most important mentors. I've learned so much from him. Nobody who has dealt with him would say that there is a venture investor in the world who's more value added than what he and his firm do for their companies. Patrick: I've been involved in companies with them now, and gotten to know him, it's true. Gavin: Maybe people add as much value, no one adds more value. Patrick: Yeah. Gavin: But his whole strategy, a lot of his strategy for venture, which I've ruthlessly copied is around the idea of their profound advantages towards being multistage. One of my rules is I don't make a significant investment until I've known a company for six months. Why would you? I'm a crossover investor so I'm IRR focused, not MOIC focused. That's a really big distinction and advantage being able to R by R against MOIC. So I do think a lot of these multistage firms, the strategy they have and you're seeing in the market which I think is imminently logical is, ""Hey, you write these small checks early ..."" By the way, Patrick, it's a reason like, we've co-invested with you several times, we watch the company. If they execute, I do think a success metric for kind of a multi-stage crossover firm becomes, no company that is in your portfolio that is performing well should ever go out to the market once they come into your strike zone. You're getting their metrics, you have perfect information on them. You're talking to the CEO, you're getting whatever metrics you want. Then it's like, ""Oh wow, we can tell they've got 12 to 15 months of cash left. Yeah, this is a good time to preempt."" Boom. I think that is the way the world is devolving.So angels C through B specialists who add a lot of value, some operational growth firms that add as much value as those early stage firms, and then these big multi-stage bulge bracket firms and some traditional venture firms are becoming those. Some hedge funds are becoming those. And you're going to see some [lawn] only guys. It's all going to merge. The one thing I do want to say to all of the VCs private equity guys, coming to public markets, it's like, ""Welcome to the lovely world of daily marks and daily prices and crazy volatility. Welcome."" It's a much more brutal quest for Alpha, Patrick. Anybody on planet earth now who has $2,000 or whatever, the Robinhood minimum's probably lower. Anybody can compete to price public equities. You're trying to generate off of public equities, you are literally competing with hundreds of millions of people and a lot of them are brilliant. They're are professional investors, and by the way a lot of them have very unique information. Peter Lynch, ""If you love the the stock, and you love the story."" Some of them are industry participants who are in the software industry and they see what companies are winning and those are the ones they buy. You go from competing with a pretty narrow competitive set of brilliant people to competing with hundreds of millions of people. Patrick: I'll steal my friend Eric's term, ""The terror dome."" Which is the term I always think of for public markets. If I count anything as, of the many things I'm lucky for, one of them in investing is so happy that I spent 15 years only doing public equities first to live that pain and that hell. Now I was doing quantitative so- Gavin: Totally. Patrick: Different flavor. There is no substitute for getting your face ripped off every couple years in a very short period of time when nothing seems to have changed. Gavin: Yeah, it keeps you humble. Patrick: Yes. Gavin: It keeps you humble. The other reason the world will go crossover is for competitive reasons. There are profound advantages to both sides to being crossed over. So it's for sure an advantage, if you're public equity investor, to see these companies for years before they become public to kind understand disruption, whatever. When you first saw Uber you kind of understood the impact of taxi medallions. So you're more sensitive to change. You're more sensitive to disruption. But I also say for a lot of times underwriting a growth equity round, one of the most important risks to assess is the risk that one of these large internet or software companies focuses on you like a laser. Generally these startups, they're not competing with the A team or even the B team at these big companies.These companies, they're really powerful, they can make their own weather, gravitational bodies. So underwriting that risk, I think, is an area where it's an advantage to look at both. My more successful venture investments was one where people were really, really worried about the internet giants coming in and competing with them. Following those companies, I was very confident that it wasn't as high a priority as the other BCs thought just wasn't as much of a risk got what, from my perspective, was a really, really, really tracked evaluation, now this is six, seven, eight years ago. But I do think there advantages to doing both once you get beyond that series B/C. Patrick: Yeah. This is kind of a shop talk question, I'm just fascinated by it since you've now done it and have experience doing it and I'm sort of in the process of doing it too. What's the difference in recruiting, evaluating, and mentoring talent if they're focused on publics versus privates? Gavin: If I could know one thing about a person to know whether or not they would be a good public equity investor, it would simply be, ""Are you capable of being rational when you're wrong?"" Because all of us all our lives were taught that when you're in third grade, you raise your hand and you have the wrong answer people laugh at you. You feel shame when you're wrong. Don't do well at a test, whatever it is. A lot of people they can't even admit when they're wrong. As a public equity investor you're going to be wrong at least all the time, right? Yes. Yeah. But a lot of great public equity investors have a batting average well under 50%. They're wrong, more than they're right, but because they make more money when they're right they still have a great track record. Maybe some of the best batting averages you'll ever see in public equities are mid 50s. Those people often don't have great track records just because they're kind of the heteroscedasticity, or kurtosis or whatever it is, the fat tails. Almost to capture those big outcomes that drive great track records you need to capture some of those fat tails, the 4% of stocks that account for all other excess treasuries.So if I was going to ask something one question about public equities, it's just, ""Can you be rational when you're wrong?"" Then part of that is just your own emotional makeup and then the other part of it is finding a philosophy and investment system that fits your own emotional makeup such you could be rational when wrong. Mine is, we discussed on our prior podcast, having a high knowledge level. Even when I have a really high knowledge level, I'm still wrong all the time, I just make higher quality, more rational decisions when I'm wrong. That dynamic, it's just not as present in private markets. You don't feel like an idiot. I mean you said every few years, I'd say I feel like an idiot every few days. When you have it super dialed in as a public equity manager, probably you're going to have one bad day a week. It's about as dialed in as it ever is. Just in private market, for sure you make mistakes, but A there's this group decision making dynamic that isn't present in most public equity firms, B you can sell it, you have a preference. So I just think there are actually probably a lot of people who could never succeed as a public market investor, and vice versa. It's different. So another big difference is in privates, as a public market investor, if you're an activist you don't need either access and you don't need to add value, you're just buying and selling stocks.As a private market investor, A you need access, you need to rapport with the founder, you need references. You need that founder to want you on his cap table. And B you do, even if you're a crossover firm, you do need to add some value. Even if your main value is going to be, ""Hey, we're going to acre your IPO. We're going to make way public, a magic carpet ride. We're going to talk you through all of that. We're going to be there in tough times for you."" There's probably a lot of people who are really, really, really good at picking public stocks who aren't that good at building a rapport with founders who can't communicate their ideas, maybe in a way that is helpful to a founder. Even if they have got good ideas for that founder, just communication isn't a strong suit. It's actually, even though at some level you're investing, the skill sets necessary to succeed I think are pretty different. And there is, by the way you know this, there is a big element to process in privates that just not at all present in publics. Click a button to buy a stock and you better get that process right. Particularly right now.",3755
255,Gavin Baker - The Cyclone Under the Surface,Sci-Fi Book Recommendations," Patrick: My son who's eight years old was asking me all these questions about what I do. So I was trying to explain some of the basics. Sometimes it's really helpful to explain something to an eight year old and the way they put it back to you is so interesting. When I described public verses private, he was like, ""Oh, so in private, the other person has to say yes too."" I thought, ""Yeah, I guess, that's true."" And he's like, ""So you have to sell them. You have to be convincing."" I thought, ""Yeah, that's definitely true. You do have to be very convincing."" Maybe that's the answer, right? There's just much more of a sales job to the private investing world than there is the public one, just like you just said. As I'm prone to ask you every time we talk, have you read any great sci-fi lately? Gavin: So I will admit two things. So one, I did recently reread Dune in advance of the movie coming out. Patrick: This is the best book. Gavin: God it's awesome. The other book that I'm reading, this is 2021 was a tough public year for me as an investor. I do have a book that is kind like a touchstone of sorts. Any time I go through a hard period I read it. It's been really good because I have a period every three to five years, like a tough period of performance, because this is a hard, humbling business. Hopefully the intervals between those periods get longer and longer as you learn and become a better and better investor. It's a book called the Wizard of Earthsea, and it's by Ursula le Guin, who's one of my favorite authors. And I think the reason it's powerful for me as a touchstone is just at the end of the day the book is all about how ego is at the root of most failures. But now it's a really powerful concept, I can remember, ""Wow, I read this when I was 25 and that was the first time I'd really made a mistake as an investor."" Then I read it again. It's almost like confidence building in and of itself to be reading it. But it's called a Wizard of Earthsea, and I would highly recommend it. I actually think in a lot of ways it inspired Harry Potter. Wizard school, etc., etc. Have you read it? Patrick: You recommended it to me, if you recall, for a similar reason. I totally get it as one of those rereadable books. Actually second thing you did for me, you were the first person that convinced me to go into the early stage investing business too. I don't know if you remember that conversation. But Wizard of Earthsea and- Gavin: Oh yeah. Patrick: -and Positive Sum have your fingerprints all over them. Gavin: Good. Well, I'm happy we get to collaborate in that business. Have you read the Culture series now, Patrick? Patrick: Not yet. The Ian Banks one? I have the first book I just bought it. It's next on my list. Gavin: You must read it?! You will not be able to put it down. And read them all. I only have one left and I'm so sad. I don't let myself read more than one every two years. They are so good. They're right up there with Dune. That and Hyperion are probably the only works of science fiction that I would compare to Dune. But you must read them. They're so good, so, so, so good. Patrick: I'll plug Hyperion like the Shrike, is it Shrike? Is that how it's pronounced? Gavin: Yeah, it's the Shrike and the Type Two. Patrick: It’s one of the coolest episodic nature of that book is so cool. I can't say enough about reading these kinds of books. I think it's so fun. I know we're way over time. This was so much fun. So many interesting topics. What a weird wild market it's been. Love navigating it, talking to you about it. Thank you so much for your time. Gavin: Yeah. Thank you, Patrick. Always love our conversations. Love being friends, love collaborating on venture. By the way, I do just want to say, I think you've done something really, really good for the world. It blows my mind when I interview these kids under 25. I was a super investing nerd. I'd read every Warren Buffet investment partnership letter twice by the time I got to my first job. I'd read Peter Lynch, I'd read George Soros. I'd read so many accounting textbooks. I think largely because of your podcast, the kids who come in now if they're motivated, because there is nothing better than investing to be kind of a self-starter it blows my mind how good they are. I think your podcast has a lot to do with it. So I think you've done something awesome for the world. Patrick: I appreciate that. You know I'm obsessed with the open source concept in general. It takes time to compound, but it's convexed when it does. Gavin: Yes, it is. Patrick: It's an amazing thing. Gavin: Well said. Patrick: I appreciate it.This site uses cookies to improve your browsing experience. By using this site, you are consenting to this policy.",1322
256,"Sam Englebardt, Richard Kim - Investing in Immersive Worlds",Introduction," Patrick: Today my guests are Sam Englebardt and Richard Kim, general partners at venture fund, Galaxy Interactive. Having come from the media and finance sectors respectively, Sam and Richard joined forces in 2018 to invest in their shared thesis that immersive digital experiences would become the dominant way people engage with each other in the future. Our conversation centers around the evolution of art, finance, and gaming as they proliferate in Web3. Please enjoy my conversation with Sam and Richard.",106
257,"Sam Englebardt, Richard Kim - Investing in Immersive Worlds",Galaxy's Journey Through Digital Art," Patrick: So Richard and Sam, we're going to talk a lot about different potential areas of impact for Web3, from gaming to art, to the financialization of everything in our conversation today, probably even touch on topics like mental health, which will be really interesting. I want to start though with art and maybe actually in the traditional art world, I know you both had a conversation with a person that runs the Whitney, a very classic art institution. I'd love to hear about that conversation. What was the purpose of it, what did you take from it and maybe touch on this idea that you learned about art versus market. I'm really intrigued by this concept and think it's a great place to start. Richard: Absolutely. So I got into a rabbit hole in the first quarter of last year in a platform called Art Blocks. As I was looking into the NFT space and asking myself the question, which of these digital art platforms are actually going to do something interesting in the long run. And the reason this platform Art Blocks stood out to me was because they specialized in what was called on chain generative art. And the idea here was that a lot of NFTs are essentially links to metadata stored on some centralized server. And so there's this critique of NFTs of, hey, despite all of the promise of decentralization, these things ultimately roll off to centralized servers and so it's fundamentally not that interesting. What makes Art Blocks interesting is aside from the dependence on a couple of libraries, like P5 JS, all of the code needed to recreate your NFT lives on chain.And I thought that was a really interesting starting point to delve into what I would later discover as generative art. It's probably worth defining what is generative art for a second. I think the most commonly used definition is from this professor Philip Galanter. And he said, ""Generative art is any art practice where the artist uses a system such as a set of natural language rules, computer program, a machine, or any other procedural invention that's set into motion with some degree of autonomy that results in a completed work of art."" Now you'll notice that that definition is not algorithmic art, which is what generative art is often associated with. And the reason it's not limited to algorithmic art is because generative art actually has decades long history going back to the fifties and sixties. And a lot of the conceptual works of art from Sol LeWitt and others.And so I found this intersection of something that has as long in story to history as generative art with this new technology that in the context of natively digital productions could bring global scarcity and global status. So fascinating. Going back to your original question, one of the things that made Art Blocks as a platform so explosive is it wasn't just an art platform. Prior to collecting on Art Blocks I would've never considered myself a big art collector. And what makes Art Blocks so singular, is that not only is it art, but it's this strange combination of almost like Robin Hood style speculation in terms of which sets are going to go up, which artists are going to have their floor prices increase, this type of talk. With almost loot box style mechanics, or gotcha style mechanics from gaming in the sense that every set in Art Blocks... how it works is the artist uploads their algorithm and when you go and mint say a piece from a thousand edition set, every one of those thousand editions is a unique one of one, it's not a thousand editions of the same thing.And what makes those pieces vary is the entropy you introduce at the time of mint. So it's this beautiful combination of controlled randomness intersecting with an algorithm that the artist has created to create a work of art that the artist, him or herself, didn't even curate. The combination of those things really captivated this audience, who again, never knew they were art collectors in such interesting ways. And it has gotten so many people excited that are particularly crypto natives. When traditional art folks are looking at this space, they say, that's really interesting and it's interesting these, quote JPEGs are selling for 7 million, but that to me just seems like a speculative bubble.I think the more nuanced criticisms or not even criticisms, but reflections on the space, a lot of the most insightful comments came from this conversation with the director of the Whitney, where he said, ""In his mind there's art which is independent of market, as this thing that if you're a student of art history, you can determine what has quality and what's not versus this market force that the crowds determine through traded volumes and floor prices what's art."" And one of the strands you see in the NFT space is this almost counterculture rhetoric of, the traditional gatekeepers it doesn't matter what they think. Art is what we say is art. And you see this most compellingly in kind of meme driven communities. Sam: With that context in mind, it raises this very important question of, we have this expression of what I observed in Richard, as somebody who was prior to going down this Art Blocks in generative art rabbit hole, was not a collector of art at all. And we sort of have this idea of come for the market. And it's undeniably true, a lot of the people in the NFT space are initially and have been DeFi people and crypto people who discovered art and were rotating out, maybe even from eth into NFT art and learned this, but you come for the markets and so many of these people then stay for the art. And the amount of passion that I've experienced. And I was at a disadvantage in this, in some ways, because I was collecting physical art for years prior to NFT art. And so when Richard jumped into this thing, my initial reaction was the same as the reaction we've seen from so many people initially in the traditional art world. The idea of, I don't know what this is, but it's not art and so I'm not going to pay attention to it. And then it was through this process and starting... and then I'll shut up and let Richard get back to some of this.But I think it's worth highlighting how far he came personally to the point, I'd put Richard next to any art collector I know in the traditional art world and say, I haven't met a person who's more studied or more serious or more creatively motivated around this particular genre of art than Richard. And that is worth highlighting, I think, because it's like, what does that mean for the possibility of this genre to expand the overall size of the market of art collectors and introduce people. And we're going to come back to this theme throughout when we talk about NFTs broadly and the increasing participation in creative endeavors, much beyond just fine art or generative art. The idea that they get sucked into something that is much more about participating in the creative process than it is about finance, but in some ways it starts from the financial place. Richard: I think this tension between trading and flipping, to use a more derogatory term of art versus buy and hold collectors, it's actually an evolution. Sam put it really well. You come for the market. When I first started collecting Art Blocks, I was a flipper because I just didn't have the capital to really just buy and hold and suffer the illiquidity of doing so. But over time, as you gain a long term view of the space, you say, if the number of wallets holding, say Art Blocks pieces expands from 50,000 to 500,000, what does that mean for the formative sets? You can start to take a longer term perspective and the things that simultaneously make NFT so powerful, the fact that every purchase in sale is on chain. The fact that when you do sell something, you get shouted out by the community as, this guy doesn't believe in the project anymore. And similarly on the buy side, this person's such a trusted member of the community.It's almost cult like dynamics that intensify what I imagine the excitement is at say a local Christie's or Sotheby's auction times a thousand. And it becomes so wrapped up in your identity of who you are in these digitally native realms that it's a very interesting tension. And one example of this, that's a pretty interesting experiment in game theory, one of the leading generative artists, Dmitri Cherniak, who created the set, Ringers, which is probably the first Art Block set to bring the platform into mainstream consciousness, his set went from floor prices of say one ether... the mid cost I think was... I don't remember exactly. I think it was 0.1 eth and at some point the floors hit about a hundred eth in this set. He created a really interesting experiment where one of his sets, the Eternal Pump, there's only 50 of them.What he said to all the pump holders was, I'm going to create a set called the Wraptures. Initially the supply of Wraptures will be limited to 50, i.e. one for every eternal pump holder. But if any eternal pump holder lists cells or otherwise does anything economic, transfers whatever their Wrapture, the supply of the Wraptures will expand from 50 to 666. And this constraint is a year long game. And Dmitri's intent here was to try to bring more of the art collector mentality instead of the art trader mentality to a space that is dominated by trading. And I think it's such an interesting experiment. As of now the experiment's about a month old, no one's violated the pact yet. But I think as we get closer to the end date, it'll be interesting to see if we can keep up the agreement because there are some folks who have one Wrapture and there are some folks who have eight Wraptures and the interests of all the participants aren't necessarily aligned. So just a fascinating experiment in the space.",2109
258,"Sam Englebardt, Richard Kim - Investing in Immersive Worlds",Lessons from Traditional Art Markets and Collectors," Patrick: Sam, you mentioned that you were a traditional art collector prior to this whole new world that you've been exposed to now. Touch a little bit on what you view as the base level variables or motivations in that world that make it go and how much of them are transferred over to this new world of digital art and which ones are sort of being left behind? The fact that Gagosian has maybe less power in this world is interesting, but does that just mean that it's just a different Gagosian, it's Vincent Van Gogh or something. There's nothing new under the sun and we're just going to see the same reconcentration of influence in this world. Tell me what you've learned from the traditional art world? And also I want to weave into this whole conversation investing and return, even if that's not the core motivation of a collector, unlike most investments, you can discount some future stream, this is really like an eye of the beholder type asset where the market does play a critical role. So I'd love to weave in some of the lessons from you and traditional art collecting and how much that teaches us about, and maybe even the dark side of art, which I think there are some, how that might bleed into this new world? Sam: It's foolish for anybody to believe today that because this art is on chain or connected to blockchain technology that therefore there aren't some of the same information, asymmetries and advantages that accrue to a small group of insiders in this world. The reality is that whether we're talking about traditional art or we're talking about crypto art, there's still a tremendous amount of alpha in the form of a small number of people who have information that's not available to everybody. So it's easy for everybody to talk about, oh, it's blockchain and that means everything's open and everybody knows everything. And it's definitely not the case. And Richard talks about this sum in terms of, even in the world of the highest integrity world of generative art versus projects that we know are created with ill intentions from day one, there are small numbers of people that have information the rest of the people don't have and that's obviously no different from the traditional art world.The opportunity for people to reset that playing field though, and to change who those people are and to reinvent the landscape is undeniable. I do think that if nothing else happens, the people who matter in the evolution of generative art, for example, will be different than the people who have mattered historically in the buying and selling of traditional physical art. So there's been a redrawing of that map and I think that's going to continue. And I think by virtue of people who did discover this first, and if we believe that it continues to be an important area and if generative art, for example, maintains or earns its place, we're only going to know this over time, but if generative art becomes a type of art, or a part of the historical art cannon, then I think it's a really interesting thing.Again, the collectors in the generative world, the brokers of generative art, are this different group of people and we'll see where they take things. The more important that generative art becomes, if it does in fact become important from that lens of art history, then I think the more opportunity this group of people, that sort of emerge this pioneers into space, are going to have to really shape where it goes to me. To me, the observation is someone who collected physical art and not at the level of a close relationship with Gagosian and at the highest end of physical art, although I'm somewhere in the middle in terms of artists that I've collected and I have a collection, but I'm not an important collector in the world of physical art. But I've been involved in it long enough to know that what certainly somebody at my level, I have not had the opportunity other than the occasional chance to meet and mingle with and get to know some artists. And I collect mostly... mostly art on my walls is from living artists. And yet there've been very little opportunity to date to really get know those artists and participate or in any way feel attached and connected to their artistic process.You can go to a gallery event, put in an effort, you get to know them a little bit. That's one really important distinction I think that's driving a lot of this NFT art and generative art world, is instantly and very intrinsic to the process of collecting generative art is a direct relationship with the artist, goes to this idea of it's not just about the output itself, but it's about the community that's being built around the art. And it's about the process in a way that physical art has never been, at least that I've experienced. And so the first thing you become aware of instantly is, wow, I'm collecting generative art, but because I'm doing it in the context and by its nature, it's this digital thing that lives inside of communities, that lives inside of discord that is always on and global and participatory amongst the community of people that are involved, it just feels completely different.There's a thrill to it. I call it this idea of a producer's high that I really believe everybody... and I'm fortunate in that I got the experience or the opportunity to experience this early in my life from getting really into content businesses and being involved in producing so many different types of content experiences. When you feel that and you actually get that rush and you get to feel like you're a patron to the creation of this art or supporting somebody to realize his or her vision, that's an experiential thing that comes with this that you really have to keep in mind and understand if you're going to analyze why people are going to be drawn and maybe why people had nothing to do with the physical art world and never would, are going to be drawn to this. Patrick: It raises for me such a critical, interesting question. Sorry, this is going to be a bit of a long question, but I'd love to spend as much time on it as you guys want to. I'll use a traditional investing term of beta. If I think about the world of NFT art, let's call it, or even zoom in on just generative art, we can zoom in to whatever degree you think is right, does it make sense if somehow I could own an index like product in this space, which I'm sure will come at some point, may not be there now. Is the beta attractive? The beta of equities is attractive over the very long term? All the evidence we have suggests that it is. Something in the traditional art world, Van Gogh, produced I think less than a thousand, maybe 900 works of art total in his life. There's an inherent scarcity there.And to me, I guess the question I have is, the attractiveness of beta has a supply demand story where there's much easier to create supply if you're a popular artist in this world. And maybe Sam, from your previous experience, creating a movie, you can only create so many. They're expensive, they're hard. When the creation of new supply and the time lag between increased demand and new supply is so fast and low and frictionless, as it seems to be in this world, it makes me worried as an investor that there's going to be any value to capture or beta return. So how do you think about those dynamics in this space? Sam: Richard, you should talk about this, bud. Time is going to tell. And I don't know that anybody can say yet. NFT art, it's so young and it's such a new thing, and it's not scaled relative to traditional art. And there isn't enough data that could possibly be collected to be able to say definitively. But it does feel like, again, going back to those things that beyond the creation process and the supply of NFT art, it's going to have to be a combination of the art that gets created, is married to other things beyond... you have to look at the value of the community or beyond just the individual work that's created in order to believe that it's going to have enduring value. Richard: I think it's worth drilling into two platforms as a test case of this question. One is Art Blocks, which we've already discussed. Art Blocks is interesting, because it's a curated platform. So the supply is not infinite, but has to pass Art Block's curation board. The other end of that spectrum is a platform on Tezos called FX Hash. And think of FX Hash as an open minting platform for generative art, where anyone, you and I, you and I could go create some code and drop it on FX Hash. Think of that as the wild, wild west. It's the latter platform where supply is actually literally infinite and yet what's so interesting about it is that the community that's come up around it has become the gatekeeper in terms of which artists are valuable, why are they valuable? If it's a known artist, what are the factors that make one set valuable and another set, not so valuable. What's the right supply for an artist to be dropping? All of these community worries that traditionally were in the hands of a Christie's or a Sotheby's or the dealers in the space, is now outsourced to community. And you would think that model would not work well. I do think we need a bifurcation just to answer your specific question. I think a beta strategy in something like the generative art space is actually a very bad strategy because of the infinite supply issue. What I look for when investing generative art NFTs is things that meet a couple buckets.The first is what is the proxy to the platform itself? So in the case of art blocks, it was Squiggles because it was the first set released on art blocks and Squiggles effectively trade as seed stage convexity in art blocks the platform itself. Then you could say the same for in the case of Quantum Art, which is a photography curation platform led by Justin Aversano that we also invested in. When we invested in that from the fund, we invested half in the equity and half into matching Twin Flames, which were the formative photography NFT that now trades at over a hundred each floors. And the reason we did that, not even so much the artistic value of the photograph itself, but what the photograph represented. In the case of fxhash, it's the RGBs that were created by the founder of the platform. So those first sets will always retain value. And then you get to the second question of, ""Okay, who are the artists that 10, 50, 100 years from now are likely to be known as having released formative work on the platform. And that's obviously a more tricky question. You can look at things like traded volumes and some of the community myths that have been created around particular artists.But I would say that a lot of the value on the platform tends to concentrate in these, call it, blue chip artists. And so then you're left with this long tail that may be amazing art, but unless the strength of the community, and this is to Sam's point, has a certain amount of velocity and staying power, these things generally tend to trade off over time. It goes back to the heart of what is an NFT, what makes an NFT interesting? I think Kevin Abosch had a great quote in his talk recently where he said, ""NFTs are a note around which communities can gather, a living evolving piece of art, a performance that we're both willing and unwitting participants in."" So the NFTs that really engaged community, have an active participants process. Matt Kane's Gazers is a good example of this, it's essentially the lunar cycle and this NFT is going to evolve over hundreds of years based on the lunar calendar. And so a community is formed around that. I think stuff like that's pretty interesting. Patrick: Evolution, meaning the art itself will change based on an external variable? Richard: Exactly, yes. The exact variables aren't even known yet. So it's a process of discovery where the community is constantly finding new things. And it's quite fun. Sam: It's interesting to think too, about this process of risk management, I guess, in terms of investing in NFT artists and the idea Richard's talking about. If you're at least focused on the defining sets, or you could say the artists, it almost feels at this point and you can include, for example, someone like Beeple in this conversation around NFT art and say, and here's an issue where he's got so much supply too, then you got to figure out, well, within his works, which are going to matter? Which is a different conversation. But I think we can all now probably say whether he ends up a chapter in a book or a paragraph in a chapter, it's still TBD, but he's cemented by virtue of being one of the first and of being so intrinsically tied to this idea and this moment in time, it's hard to imagine that he's not going to be an artist in the long term that you look back at it and say, ""Well, okay, there was this thing that happened.""And again, if you believe that you've always got to evaluate art from the perspective of its timeline and the historical evolution of it and the cannon of art through history, I think you can say that about him. You can say that about again, if generative art, which feels like it's such a natural evolution of the process married with this technology of our times, that's how at least we come to saying, ""Okay, within this space, we can narrow it down to some of the artists that we have high conviction. If this movement, or this genre has talked about at all, which we believe it will be, these are probably a pretty safe bet that they maintain in the conversation."" Patrick: Maybe just to put a fine point on this opening conversation around art specifically, it seems like as a category, it is undeniably cool and interesting as a new expression of human creativity. It's hard not to look at some of these projects and just think, ""Wow, that's so creative and cool and new and different."" And therefore it's not surprising that people with means want to collect these things. There's plenty of precedent through history. That's undeniably true in my view. To then make the leap from that to, ""Okay, my opportunity cost let's say is the S&P 500 or something that I should make the leap to including this in my portfolio is the one where I don't know the answer to."" And when investors ask you that question, I'm just curious now with all this experience, how you think about it for your own portfolio. I love the idea of splitting the investment between equity and actual pieces of art as the right way to express the investing view. Maybe just sum up your view on why this is interesting for investors, why they should at least do more work here? Richard: Work here. I think getting access to the space in the right way is really important. One of the things we've been thinking about is, how can we combine, going back to the question you asked around the director of the Whitney, how can we combine top down critical narratives and curation in what we think is an important art movement together with access to emerging artists and opportunities in a way that there is real investment value, precisely because they're undiscovered. And so our thinking there is to really try to create the MoMA for generative art by pairing some of the leading artists and curators in the space with some of the leading collectors and providing a vehicle for interested investors to get access to this space. And then most interestingly, not have the financial exit strategy here, be essentially flipping NFTs, but acquiring this permanent collection and then tokenizing the engagement and passion of the collector community around that through social tokens or NFT memberships, or otherwise. And I think that as a theme is something that is likely to have staying power across consumer markets generally, this idea of tokenizing that latent engagement that has always existed in games, virtual worlds, art, et cetera, but for the first time now is finally able to be captured. Sam: Yeah, I would also say, Patrick, especially if we want to talk about this stuff in the context of a portfolio, and you mentioned the S and P for example. I think you also need to say, in terms of your individual portfolio construction or if you're doing this on behalf of monies that you're managing for somebody else for example, it should go without saying that this belongs still very much, and we talked a little bit about some ways art might branch out as a different type of asset class, but right now NFTs, generative art, all of this stuff should be in that bucket. And either you're collecting it for the reasons you just said, people, collectors find it incredibly cool, find it incredibly creatively interesting, all the reasons you collect art away from financial returns anyway. Or if you really are viewing this as an opportunity, an investment opportunity, it belongs in the high risk venture portion of your portfolio and a small subset of that. And so I think you have to remember where this is and what we're talking about in terms of its place in your balance portfolio is really important. Certainly, we wouldn't say invest in generative art instead of the S and P necessarily, they're apples to oranges.",3772
259,"Sam Englebardt, Richard Kim - Investing in Immersive Worlds",Galaxy's Digital Thesis," Patrick: Now's probably the right time to, done one deep dive already on art, generative art specifically, to zoom back out to the Galaxy wide view on this entire world. We'll classify this world as crypto, Web3, whatever you want to call it, and hear the thesis overall of Galaxy. And then I also want to inject into the conversation, the lens that each of you bring to the Galaxy thesis or view of the world, based on your past experience. Sam, you already mentioned your experience in media. Richard, your experience in finance and trading. I think these are really two interesting sets of lenses to view this new opportunity. So maybe begin by level setting us with what is the overall view of the world from a Galaxy perspective that can let us then go into some of these other verticals? Sam: A minute on the history of Galaxy then is helpful because understanding Galaxy Interactive and its place inside of Galaxy Digital. Galaxy Digital is a publicly traded merchant bank that Mike Novogratz and a few other partners started in 2018. The vision there was really to be the institutional bridge to Web3 and blockchain and crypto, and to provide a place for people to gain access to the space broadly in a simple a way as possible to really enable people to access crypto and blockchain. Inside of Galaxy Digital, Richard and I run a division of a company called Galaxy Interactive. When we're talking, and what we're speaking about mostly, is our Galaxy Interactive perspective. And Galaxy Interactive is a venture business., it's a traditionally structured GPLP venture fund, we're investing our second fund and focused entirely on this sector that we call Interactive, which is really that intersection of content and Web3, and infrastructure technology. We started Galaxy Interactive back in 2018 when we launched our first fund. Our view of the world was that interactivity and immersive digital experiences were quickly becoming the dominant way that most people are engaging with other people in the world and experiencing the world. It was true then and it's certainly true now that people are spending the majority of their conscious time inside of digital worlds via the devices that they have in their lives. And we talk a lot about metaverse and we don't need to go down that rabbit hole necessarily right now, and all the visions of what that could mean. But the reality is, and especially if you think about second screens and third screens and what's going on from the time that you wake up and certainly the younger generations than me, from the time you wake up to the time that you go to bed, you are primarily conversing with and entertaining yourself digitally.That is just the reality of how people are living their lives and where their friends are and how they're building their identity, and it's only getting to be more the case every day. That realization of, ""Okay, we are in the process of, whether we like it or not, talk about the good and the bad of all this, but we are in the process of a migration from a predominantly at one point entirely physical existence to a predominantly digital existence."" And everything that we used to define who we are in the world is at least touched by and increasingly influenced significantly by the digital experiences that we have and the friendships we have in these digital worlds. That is the thesis that Richard and I really bonded over. And the thing is, we didn't come together initially to build Galaxy Interactive. Mike and I, and everybody we'd launched Galaxy Digital, we were building the business. We initially hired Richard as the founding COO of Galaxy Digital. And he came over from London where he was in the FX business at Goldman and came over to be the COO of Galaxy Digital. And then he and I in the first six months of him moving to New York and joining Galaxy, we were spending a ton of time together and I was in my seat originally overseeing the overall venture business for Galaxy Digital. We had a fund that was going to be a generalist blockchain fund that sat inside of the Galaxy Digital Topco ecosystem. And then Richard and I just realized we were completely bonded around the idea that exodus to the immersive digital worlds, and what was that going to mean? And wow, they were really the tip of the spear we thought then, and it's still very much the case was gaming and video games.That was my perspective from having been a media investor and content producer creator for 20 years, every imaginable type of old media that then led me to video games. And by 2018, it was very clear that this is the most interesting thing happening in the evolution of media and content. And Richard came at it from a different perspective, but an equally important one. And you need both, I think, to really understand what's going on in the world right now, which was, ""Wow. So these video game worlds are robust economies in and of themselves., and without talking about crypto, look at what's happening in the way that they monetize them, look at the collection and trading of digital objects, and look at the way people are acquiring these things to build their status and their identity."" And we just really bonded around all these ideas and said, ""Well, okay, this is super interesting because if we're right, we're sitting in this moment of time where there are these two massive growth trends, traditional gaming and video gaming and immersive interactive entertainment on the one hand, and then everything that this evolution of finance and decentralization of finance and trading technologies, all the stuff on the financial side of things, these two worlds are growing at enormous speeds with tremendous tailwinds and they're colliding.""",1165
260,"Sam Englebardt, Richard Kim - Investing in Immersive Worlds",The Hidden Costs of Always-On Markets," Patrick: I was going to say, I want to come back to gaming, but I really would love, Richard, to hear a little bit about before we do that, setting the stage with this concept that you said before, about the financialization of everything. One of the both exciting and also somewhat horrifying ideas of Web3 is that you could insert a market into everything, into a game, into a company, into a whatever, and trade it 24/7. And you come from an FX trading background, deeply familiar with trading systems and how that world works. I would love to hear your view on, based on your history the financialization of everything, what the opportunities to that are and what scares you about it? And maybe here's where we can talk about mental health. Richard: I just wrote a piece on this actually. It was my 36th birthday a couple days ago. I was thinking about this question, what would I tell my 18 year old self? When I was 18, I just graduated university going to law school and I was just in a rush to get somewhere. And for someone who works professionally, I grew up as a lawyer first and then I moved on the markets business, these are all zero sum markets. And I think particularly for those coming from a financial industry background to crypto, they bring the zero sum mentality that is perhaps the most destructive thing possible coming to Web3 because web three is this environment of abundance, not scarcity. And if you bring that mentality, it will come to all the wrong conclusions. So I concluded, I would tell myself that, ""Don't be a trader, be a builder and play these games of abundance, and actually try to restrict your optionality entirely on the speculative sphere of Web3."" Because if you think about, if you unpack what does Web3 mean? And if it really boils down to the financialization of everything, there's three distinct buckets of it in my mind. There's a speculative sphere because you can now tokenize so many different things, the opportunity for markets and best execution and price discovery and all these things lending has just massively expanded. That's one sphere. The other sphere is for participants, how do you earn these tokens? If tokens are the lifeblood of networks generally, one path you could take is come to the space with zero capital. And I get asked this question all the time, how do I get started? There is now a credible path where you don't need to come to the space with 10 Ethereum, make your way by flipping NFTs. You could go discover how can I productively spend my time and participate in as many networks, DOWS, et cetera, that correlate with my interest and values and just earn. Never really think about trading and which projects are going to outdo the other.And then there's a third sphere of the consumer side of it, of spending these tokens on say NFTs or skins in games, et cetera. And all these three spheres today when I hear talk about Web3, they get conflated into one bucket. And what worries me about that is I just don't think retail, mass retail is ready for the financialization of everything. Why? Because the psychological impact of having these tokens, which are greater than a hundred wall assets, go up and down and thinking, ""Oh, I should have sold at that local top. And I should have bought at this local bottom."" It will kill you. You literally will not have the stamina to survive the game. And in my post, I was recounting how I bought 10,000 Eth at 97 cents in 2015 after reading a fantastic book about the promise of Eth. And then I printed out on a paper wall and I told myself, ""I'll come back to this in five years."" And then three weeks later, I was reading an article on Eth and I saw that it was $2.25 cents. And I said, ""Oh my God, I have to sell that. That's a three accent in three weeks. The ROI of that is insane."" What I did when I sold that was I created a mental block in my mind of, ""Okay, I'm obviously not going to buy this thing until it goes back below 2.25, $2.25 cents. And obviously that didn't happen. It just went from there. And so these missed opportunities, they really, really add up over time if you believe the supercycle hypothesis. And what that doesn't mean is everyone go buy, go market buy Bitcoin and crypto. That's a tremendously risky strategy. This idea of earning without capital outlay is something I'm quite focused on and I think is key to the long term sustainability of participation in Web3. Patrick: Yeah, I think it's such a fascinating topic because there's been some stories about the dark sides of say a RobinHood, where in the one sense, I'm a deep believer in the introduction of markets and the price discovery they represent as being a driving force for good through world history, certainly in modern world history. And at the same time, price discovery happens through humans to some extent. And there's just been some painful, trading is painful, trading is bad for almost everyone, in terms of just returns. We know that from equity market data. And it's a fascinating conundrum, on the one hand, I'd love to hear more about where you think we'll see more markets pop up because of Web3 infrastructure. And what the good sides of that ledger are? So maybe we can go there now. What are the most exciting places that we might insert markets in the financialization of everything that have you most excited? Richard: I think lending is really interesting in the right context. Today, unfortunately, lending against things like NFPS is used in a way that frankly fuels some of the dark side of what's happening. And I'm speaking from personal experience here. One of the other pieces I wrote a couple months ago was, I called it The Diaries Of An Accidental Art Addict. What ended up happening is I became so consumed by art blocks and what it represented that there's no end to want. There's always a better piece that you just wish you had. And when you have financial primitives like lending, where you can get 30 to 50% LTV loans against the floor prices of your NFT collateral. And the reason that's possible is because of this idea of composability as a primitive, because NFTs are standardized ERC-721s, it becomes very for a company wanting to be a lending protocol to build a smart contract that takes that 721 and creates a simple marketplace for lenders and borrowers to come together.On the one hand you can say, ""That's amazing. I can't believe we have these composable building blocks being built together so quickly."" On the other hand, what that results in is just everything being sped up a hundred X. And if you start with this fundamentally unstable base of desire, these financial building blocks will compound you probably into oblivion. So the question is, ""What is the healthy version of this world?"" And the healthy version of the world is one where you have marketplaces for virtual goods of all kinds, whether NFTs, in-game skins, membership tokens in communities, whatever. You have these concepts that you have in FX, like best execution and minimizing brokerage fees being put into these meta marketplaces that previously you couldn't extract the value from at all, because these virtual goods, it was never possible to instantiate engagement value into a thing you could trade. That to me is what's really exciting about this is that you can get paid for the first time for doing the things you love and could previously only spend money on, i.e, consume, which is one of the three spheres I was talking about. Now you can earn and consume at the same time. And I think that's the long term promise. Patrick: Sam, what about you? What has you interested and or concerned about this financialization of everything trend that defy what Large might represent? Sam: A couple of things. On the excited and optimistic side buried in what Richard was saying is this idea that by actually participating and not getting sucked into the speculative financial games, but participating in the things you love to do, it's enabled this whole group of people to create value for themselves in a way that they never could before. And they don't need to put themselves at tremendous financial risk to do that, they just need to actually build and execute on a set of skills that many of them have, and are finally for the first time through this scalable in a way that they weren't previously. I'll give you a real close to home story that I find super inspiring about all of this, and it is exactly what Richard was talking about. My sister, Tara, who for 20 years has been an incredible, frankly underappreciated, independent musician and artist that is creative in every imaginable way, both in music and in visual arts and has spent most of the last 20 years of her career building up skills around community building, and initially really in an effort to apply those talents to build an audience for herself and for her own music.And she had no money to bring to the NFT art world in a speculative way, all she had were her skills and her abilities that she'd honed, in terms of how to build all audiences and how to expose people to creativity and share her ideas. And in this period of time, she's radically changed her life, no financial risk, but by getting involved in projects and building community. And, doing all the things that if NFTs were to go away tomorrow, these would still be incredibly valuable skills in the world today, given this sort of evolution to digital. And by avoiding a lot of the dark side that we were just talking about, it's been almost entirely a positive experience for her and it's changed her life financially.And it's enabled her to build a community of people and friends, was never possible when she just had her own music to market. But for me, in some ways away from the financial risks, the most obvious and I've felt it in myself and it's been a constant tension for me, in terms of how involved to let myself get in this world. The part about the financialization, and the trading and all of the stuff that's going on in this world, and some of it is tied to mental health. It's also just directly about what are you doing with your time each day? It is, as anybody that spent any time on Discord, or the more involved you get in the world of NFT is like, the speed at which this is going on and the volume of notifications and the distractions on your life, if you want to really engage in and participate in this world in a meaningful way. And this is true, if you ask my sister, whether you're spending money or you're not spending money, if you're involved in this world, there is a psychic cost to it that we got to pay attention to, because I'm eight years older than Richard and know that he always jokes he's the oldest guy in crypto, but I'm 44 and I'm old for this space. And I'm old for it and I'm also somebody that generally I don't enjoy in any way, spending my time on social platforms like Discord, even though I recognize the importance of it and I'm fascinated by it intellectually, and it's impossible to opt out of it if you're in our business. But I look at it from that perspective of, wow, how distracting is this? And is this world in order to do it at all, are we subjecting ourselves to an exponentially more distracting experience than we had already created for ourselves by introducing the always-on constant barrage of email, and then text messages, and then all the other notification platforms.And it's like, if you participate in this, you realize, ""Oh my God, what is this doing to my ability to concentrate, to my ability to think, to ability to just get quiet and figure out for myself on a daily basis, as we all need to do?"" ""What do we care about?"" ""What matters to us?"" That's my biggest concern. And it's 180 degrees from the minutia of financial market sophistication. It's more about what life are we living? What are we thinking about? What do we value? But then if you ask about the dark side of that, so that's a very personal individual thing, are you or aren't you actually realizing a quality life for yourself, a sense of calm and thinking and talking somewhat existentially now, but there's that. But then there's like, okay, so at scale, like what happens if all the people participating in this and the ones that do cross over into, at least some temporary sense of financial progress or they've changed their lives with crypto or they do this, just think about the more that you've made this your whole life, and your whole purpose and your sense of self. Then what does that do to you, if the financial part goes away, are we in this moment in time where that could lead to radicalization of a whole generation? And, it's all that kind of stuff that I go to when I think about the dark side of this.",2815
261,"Sam Englebardt, Richard Kim - Investing in Immersive Worlds",The Social Impact of Gaming," Patrick: We'll stop the staring into the abyss part of the conversation there. But I do think it's fascinating question like, is this cigarettes? There's already questions about social media, which we got 10 plus years of experience with now. Is this more of the same of what we look back on this in 30 years and say, ""Can you believe we let our 16 year old trade this shit on their phone?"" Like, it's an important and fascinating question. We're not going to have the answers here today. So let's focus on the positive and I want to get to gaming. Sam, we've hinted at your past career in media. Would love to hear both what you were doing in that 20 year period, but also the models that you bring with you, maybe specifically around gaming to media. I love this producer's high concept, people as individuals or as groups love producing things which create wonder or awe in the audience, whether that's a piece of art or a movie, a game or whatever. That seems obviously something we can bet on persisting and growing. So talk me through your background, and both of your perspective on gaming as a subcategory, an important subcategory of this new technology. Sam: I'm also like Richard, I'm a lawyer by training, recovering lawyer, as we both say now and it happened while I was in law school. I was very passionate then about film and had been for a long time. And I just was looking for things, the third year of law school was notoriously boring. I ended up just indulging a passion I had in trying to make films, mostly motivated by a couple of friends I met along the way who were also in similar places in their life. And so, I ended starting my career producing films, and then I never really fully let myself just go down the entirely creative path and I always felt pulled back to doing something in a business context, we don't need to get into all the reasons why I think. But it was interesting, I was passionate and interested in making films, but I also wanted to do something more than just be in our artists out there. So, that led to really a career in traditional media investing and building businesses and really every possible old media, as we say. Like if it was a business in the media sector that was in or had been in secular decline, I was probably involved with it in one way or another, from 2002 to 2015 or so with a long time friend and partner. Initially, I went to work for him, a guy named Michael Lambert who had his own amazing career in media. I went to work with him, and then we ended up partnering. We built a couple chains in movie theaters, and we rolled up record labels, and we were involved of the production companies and all of that. And that just, I think very naturally, if you were doing old media from 2000s, led me to digital media and more emerging media tech, just mainly out of curiosity and things were happening in the space.YouTube had launched, and the iPhone was released, and streaming video is becoming possible, and you see all those things and it was just even back in 2010, it seemed impossible to miss the fact that video games were going to be incredibly important in this story and in the way that people were consuming content. I invested my first game studio. I convinced Michael to let me have a little allocation of one of our portfolio companies to build a portfolio earlier stage venture vets. And one of the first ones was a video games studio called seismic games, which ended up getting sold to Niantic in 2016. That led me down the video game rabbit hole and that led to investing in some, back then, emerging VR and AR technology companies, an eye tracking technology company called Eyefluence, a couple up on Google. And, it just was like opened my eyes to this whole world. And, I found it super interesting. And, it's also actually how I wound up in Bitcoin and crypto, because I think the world of crypto back then, you were either somebody coming from the real hardcore, like hacking community, or you were coming from the video game world. Because it was the video game people that were already comfortable and had been comfortable for years with the idea that digital objects could have value, because they were critically important part of the early MMORPG's and people were already actively then even trading digital objects, and mining digital gold in Warcraft, and creating secondary marketplaces for their purchase and sale of these objects, and all the things that we think about now with digital objects and blockchain. It was like those people had accepted this ahead of most other people in the world that these digital things could have value.And so, it's like the pioneers in that world that I met through the gaming world that then convinced me like in 2012, I guess when I first bought Bitcoin, ""Hey, that you should pay attention to this."" And one thing that was consistent for me through all that was seeing the emergence and the emerging importance of digital technology and the video gaming in particular. And it just seemed to me, there was always is going to be a place and I still believe there will always be a place for passive lean back entertainment. And there are times when you're not going to want to have to engage, and make choices and you just want to be entertained, or you just want to allow yourself to be sucked into a story. There are other times and probably the majority of the time going forward, where you really want to actively create a narrative for yourself and be part of making the story. And, that's where video games and everything that's emerging from this trend are so important. What that leads me to think about now, and as we look at gaming, and blockchain and crypto, I think the observation I have is how hard it is to actually tell great stories. If you've had the opportunity to engage with traditional media, and understand film and TV, and especially content pre the last 10 or 12 years, where everything got chopped into shorter and shorter blocks.And back when the format still allowed for and required the telling of a great story in three acts, and evolution of our characters and the journey that they're on and all the things you think about with storytelling, that I think are universally true. And, we've been talking about them going back to Plato and Aristotle and I don't think anything's going to change going forward. And we need to remember that, and I think some experience with traditional media and traditional storytelling can really inform how you think about video games and how you think about, especially like as new genres of games and games intersect with blockchain and all this stuff. Some fundamental things are not going to change. I think storytelling, in particular is timeless in terms of what ultimately attracts people to great stories and how great stories are defined. Because really what it is, is existentially what we as human beings are going through in our lives. And so, that's a big part of what inform everything that I think about when we look at companies to invest in games that studios are building. Patrick: Richard, I think there's an interesting, like other side of this coin in the Web3 context, where obviously like table stakes is you have to have a great game. If it's not a good game long-term, people don't play it, like who cares about anything else? But then within a great game, if you've got two great games, a distinguishing feature of a winning game, and maybe therefore a winning investment in a studio, or in a platform or something may be determined by the economic structure of the world, the rules of the game, the rules of the currency, etc., the financial incentive system. And I would love to hear your view on, I guess this is a game specific question, but also just bigger, like the design of economic systems all this sudden, people call it tokenomics or something, is a really important thing. And we've seen with things like Axie, where people that were in these play to earn games for a time were making these incredible wages. They fell off a cliff. I think they've now, or at least they did a one point fall back below the minimum wage or the minimum amount that people were making and some of those geographies. The design of these incentives is critical to the long-term success of the ecosystem. Talk me through how you think about that side of the coin taking for granted, like there needs to be good games, people will not play them if they're not fun. But, what's your take on tokenomics and the importance of that discipline. Richard: We like to learn by doing and one of the things we did in the third quarter of, I think it was 2020, we created a discord community called RNG, Random number generator. I really wanted to drill into this question you just asked of, can you go from nothing to something, creating a token and wrapping a community around that and creating long-term games and use cases for a token. And so, we launched this thing and in the few weeks, it was the most mental experience I've ever had in my life, like thousands of people flooded the discord and we had the silliest games that people would compete for. And some of them people spent all night staying up, competing in. So this token that literally did nothing, other than a promise's going to hold some interesting value. And I had one of our portfolio company, CEOs, Raph Koste, who's a legendary game designer was involved in Ultima Online, Star Wars Galaxies, come in.And I said, ""Hey Raph, isn't this the greatest thing ever? ""I mean, you've written books on this, but I just created a token and I just did everything you thought you knew in two weeks."" ""What do you think of that?"" And he had one of the most amazing responses to that. I actually just want to read what he said, it sticks with me to this day. He said,"" Community exists because of what they share first, values and interests."" ""Money is a way to reduce friction and improve trust between people who don't share values, interest and the like."" ""Money exists, so you can engage in exchanges with people you do not know, or trust or like."" ""Communities exist for the exact opposite reason."" ""You do not build the community around the currency, you build the currency around connecting communities."" And then he went on to describe how... What was strange about RNG was that the unifying force was crypto, and crypto is a very big tent. Because within that big tent, you have sub communities of gamers, thinkers, funders, makers and so on.And it's not ecosystem, it's a crowd. And every human community on earth is centered around a town square and some organizing force. And so he was not saying, I'm unclear on why this community exists. Over time, I discovered he's right. And I think those words are something that every profile pick community and every community that's kind of high on rising floors and such should really think about, because it goes to this question of what drives long-term sustainability of any community? Like the first question I ask myself on any token is, why would someone buy this? And it seems like such an obvious question, but in all the talk on play-to-earn, what you hear the most is some variant of, ""Oh, it goes back to the Vitalik story, I wish I could have sold my sword in the game, I can't believe I didn't own my things."" And that's all great, but that's the supply side. Where's the demand side. Who's going to come in, in the context of a system of constantly inflating virtual goods and want to buy this stuff. And so, it got me thinking pretty deeply about what drives sustainability. And I think the most insightful thing I heard on play-to-earn in the last year was at a cocktail party from someone entirely outside the space. I was telling this individual about the wonders of play-to-earn and asking her like what design heuristics she thought might drive long-term sustainability.And she replied very simply, ""A virtual world that mirrors real life."" I thought that was actually a very deep statement, because it goes to kind of what Sam was describing at the end of what he was just saying, that simulation, this idea of simulation and this world where we can kind of learn something about ourselves that we just don't get in the every day. And, that these impactful experiences are the ones that are this almost alternate reality that teach us about our true selves. I think that's why kids love playing Minecraft. If I watch my 11 year old play Minecraft and build these virtual worlds that are amazing. And I said, ""Hey, why are you spending all this time in Minecraft and not The Sandbox, where you could be earning tokens for your time."" And his answer was very simple in Sandbox, there's no Redstone and without this concept of the building blocks of electricity, how could you build a living world. The core to this simulation environment and what makes simulation sustainable is user generated content at the end of the day. And, I don't think user generated content in a vacuum works well. Loot is a great example of this, where you literally have these NFTs that have some words on it, and it's like, go build a myth, the narrative, whatever you want to call it around this stuff. And you saw some early experimentation, but unless you have some more top down storytelling, as Sam was saying, to kind of bind together that UGC. One reason you see the most successful mods in gaming come off of games like StarCraft and such is, because you have that great top down experience first and foremost. Sam: As I listen to that, it's such a reminder that it's the balance. And if you're building a game or you're telling a story of any kind right now, today especially, absolutely you need to think about like, how do you introduce enough tools and opportunities for user generated content for people to feel empowered and not enough, so that they just are off the rails and don't know where they're going. And this is true, like if you think about whatever the meeting, if you think about film and the fact that like it's not an accident that great stories are told through the lens of a camera, which has a very finite range. You're able to point people to where you want them to look, and they're going to take from that what they experience and everybody's going to bring to any content experience, their own unique perspective and history and point of view, but ultimately being directed enough.And when you start thinking about game development, or I remember in the ongoing evolution of something like VR, where the promise is, oh, you're going to be able to put a VR headset on and look everywhere. It's a really interesting, empowering idea. And again, this comes up all the time in metaverse conversations. But it's also hugely problematic because at the point that you introduce the ability for people to look everywhere and there's no more real direction of a camera, the dilution of the story you're trying to tell, and even just giving people enough rails to tell a story for themselves becomes really, maybe an insurmountable obstacle to people having a great content experience. And that's going to be the thing that I think every creative person as they start to build games, or as they start to introduce these ideas that increasingly rely on user generated content to allow community to build. We're going to be constantly up against this tension of what do they need to be guided towards and ultimately, should they be democratically able to create for themselves?",3320
262,"Sam Englebardt, Richard Kim - Investing in Immersive Worlds",An Investor's Perspective on Gaming Companies," Patrick: Coming back to like an investor's perspective on all of this, Richard, I thought that answer was so interesting. So many interesting aspects that we could dive deeper on, community before token, and mimicking the real world and all of these things. And then, there's been the reality in gaming that some of the most successful, both usage and financial outcomes have been in platform companies. You can think of Minecraft like a tooling company, you think of Roblox like a platform or a tooling company that allows the creation of other stuff on top of it. So when you take that reality, and then think about investing in gaming or gaming related companies or projects in Web3, how do you think about where that return might accrue? Are you thinking about it in those terms, or is it more bottom up? What can we learn from what kinds of gaming companies have won in the past and apply that to the future or not? Richard: What's interesting is the types of content investments we've made are those that in success can parlay the UGC dimension of what they're doing into a broader platform. But I'm very skeptical of content pitches that start out purely as UGC plays for the reasons we've just discussed. So what you really want to see is that storytelling, that top down great player experience, and then leveraging the mythology around the characters and allure developed in that world to inspire users to create variance on that theme, and then use the power of Web3 to monetize some of those creations. I think that's a heuristic that we'll see be quite successful going forward. It doesn't start because you say we're going to be a platform, and any pitch that starts out that way when they have zero users, I'm immediately quite skeptical of. Sam: They need to start us, here's the world we're going to create and again, that's the top down perspective. We're going to create this world and this is the experience, and people are going to want to live in it and spend time in it. And then these games, you've hit on it though, Patrick, in terms of blurring of the line between a game and a platform and that's increasingly... I mean, part of the reason why you're seeing games become so venture investible, for example, over the last few years is because that line has been blurred. The great games today are both content experiences from a top down and they evolve into places where people can spend time and create a persistent life for themselves. I think the best games will over time be somewhat in distinguishable between, is it a content experience or is it a platform? And, we'll be asking ourselves those questions all the time. Richard: Yeah. And we're also so early in the blockchain gaming space, like there's a real risk of over-indexing on some of the code early successes in the space. Like Axie, that I'd say 99% of blockchain gaming falls within a few buckets today, some variant of buy this NFT, and stake it and earn rewards. I think the term I've come across is gamify, that's one bucket. Then there's the other bucket of buy this NFT, like say your Axie's, and then go and battle them, and level them up and earn the self currency type of framework. And I think these initial use cases are interesting and teach us a lot, but they're not how this stuff is going to go mainstream. When you watch the videos of people like Asmongold after the Square Enix announcement on their NFT plans and you actually drill into the objections. The crux of the objection is that gamers view NFTs as like micro transactions squared in terms of how much exploitation there is of the consumers who, going back to our point about simulation, all these gamers just want is suspension from reality. And to not have to worry about, ""Oh my God, when I buy this sword, is it a good buy or a bad buy? And what do I do with it?"" And all these questions. It really suspends the immersion that you seek as a gamer. How you retain that immersion. I'm playing Breath of the Wild for the second time now. And it's just such a beautiful game. Imagine you're playing Breath of the Wild and you have a marketplace only for every herb you collect and all these things. We saw this with Diablo III and what that does to a game. How you bring open market primitives to closed loop immersive worlds, I think is a really interesting question.And I think the path forward there involves giving gamers value for their time in a free to play way, without asking them to buy anything. Over time, by virtue of spending time and engagement in these worlds, they'll earn the equivalent of a soft currency or a grind currency, like in Axie this is SLP. They can keep that, or sell it, or do whatever they want with it. But to the extent you want to be more of an owner in this community owned game. Then you can go and buy this hard currency in the ecosystem to which economic rents of the activity in the game will look for over time. And I think that's a really interesting bifurcation of players on the one hand earning soft currency for their time that they can monetize, versus more hardcore believers who want to go more on the financial side, become truer owners, having that option as well. And I think the introduction of these concepts to gamers in a way where they don't even know it's crypto is one of the themes that excites me in the coming years. Patrick: What was the lesson from Diablo III? What happened there? Richard: What Blizzard found with Diablo II was you would have, through eBay, these players coming together and basically exchanging items because you could trade items. And they thought, ""Oh, well, why don't we just influence this marketplace functionality and create the auction house?"" And that did, and it really resulted in this player experience where everything you did in the game was guided by the extrinsic motivations of wanting to earn a buck in the marketplace.And it really detracted from the core player experience. And was this cautionary tale that you often hear as a reason why blockchain gaming is not going to work. Gamers generally have this attitude that everything interesting has been tried before and usually failed. I think there's a way to learn from the past while also improving on some of the deficiencies that have taken players out of the mental state they want to be in. And really give them what they want without talking about it. Sam: If you think about it, in a really simple way, if you think about a gamer who, whatever the game may be about. Let's just take a gamer who's an incredible shot in a first person shooter. Or somebody who's great at exploring worlds in an MMO, or whatever it may be. There's almost no reason to assume that that person should have, or will have any of the financial sophistication to then convert over and understand markets and trading and all the stuff that we've been talking about. You almost have to ask yourself on the Venn diagram, where will those people overlap? And to the extent that they don't, how do you make sure that the people who are playing this game are going to enjoy it and be able to do something? And Richard alluded to that. The stress of wondering all of a sudden, if you don't have the ability to participate in this world in the way that you thought you did, can be really just a viscerally unpleasant thing for people.That's why I think it's really worth this question of, we ask ourselves all the time. Undeniably, the TAM of blockchain games alone on all the games that ultimately require or take advantage of these financial skill sets. That's looking to be like a big enough business in and of itself. And there's a lot of reason to be super optimistic about where those will go. But I think the question of whether that will cross over into traditional gaming in some of the ways that we talk about, is an open question. Because again, it just isn't that these are overlapping skill sets amongst people or interests amongst people.",1767
263,"Sam Englebardt, Richard Kim - Investing in Immersive Worlds",How to Improve Web3," Patrick: My second to last question for you both is a bit of a tough one because most of this story is in the future, not in the past. I'm trying to come up with new ways of saying it's early, because everyone keeps saying it's early and it's starting to bother me. But clearly, in this case, it is early. If it is the thing, if it is a massive value creative event, like the internet, like many people believe it might be. There's tons of uncertainty, so it's hard to have tons of contrarian views. But if you had to identify something that maybe you most disagree with the Web 3.0 investing community on, is there something that comes to mind for both of you? Richard: Yeah, I'd say on the investing side, you've seen a massive capital influx into token projects because of this idea that, if you get in early, let's say 30 to 50 million type of valuations. On launch, you see these token networks often trading at fully dilutive valuations of well over a billion. In some cases, closer to 10 billion at launch. And it's this massive unlock. And you have all of this capital and productive activity flowing from the notion that your 20 to 30 million valuation has turned into a billion to 10 billion valuation. But that's not actually true in the sense of, what you're looking at with the 10 billion FDV number, fully diluted valuation number, is the top of book mark on a token. Not taking into account any liquidity depth. And more importantly, not taking into account investing schedules. This issue of non-comparability. Take two tokens. Imagine they're the exact same thing, but one token something resembling a Fair Launch with no insiders, investors, whatever. Basically, it was mined by the entire community and therefore it was more distributed without any vesting schedules.And then take the same token and have it owned 25% by investors, 25% by team and a bunch to insiders basically. And you have, let's say your standard four year token vesting unlock. That latter token, I would argue, from a purely financial trading and hedging standpoint, strikes me a lot more similar to a binary option in terms of its hedging profile. Than it does a continuous thing with liquidity along the spectrum. I think this idea of token non-comparability is going to be a really important thing, not just from a financial reporting standpoint, as you compare fund performance, for example. But from a actual productive allocation of capital standpoint. Because the reality is we're just seeing terrible projects get funded at valuations of 10 to 200 million. Companies that would've gone bankrupt for lack of ability to raise funding, hired a Web 3.0. I think hopefully the effects of this will be localized in terms of just those investors investing that capital just realizing their own losses. But you would hate to see a broader skew of productive capital as a result of this fundamental misunderstanding of the FTV. Patrick: Sam, what do you think? Sam: I guess a related point, but slightly differently. I mean, I think general inflation of financial KPIs and actual use KPIs in this space is really alarming. Even by some pretty sophisticated investors, or you would think. Where they're looking at token performance and inferring from that, things that have to do with the success of a game or the idea that people are going to ultimately be in that world and build things and then care. And it's like, in so many of these projects, actual use is nothing and the value. I mean, it goes to Richard's point. And some of that is because people don't understand or aren't digging into what a fully diluted token value means. And some of it is just because they're speculating on token prices. They're not considering the fact that none of this is going to matter if people aren't in the software, playing and building things for a long time to come. And that's the part where I just think we still are seeing very, very few examples of enough people in these worlds for it to matter. And on a relative basis to traditional games, for example. They shouldn't even measure a blip and yet, we're seeing valuations that are shockingly high. Patrick: I love both answers. That's a great closing point on what I've enjoyed about the conversation, which is this mix of excitement with two different, but relevant real world previous set of experiences that you bring to the table. And that it's okay to be excited and skeptical about a lot of the details.And from an investing standpoint, that's actually critical. You have to be that probably to do well. I ask everyone the same closing question. Excited to get to ask it twice. Richard, and we'll start with you. What is the kindest thing that anyone's ever done for you? Richard: Yeah, this one's pretty easy for me. It's going to sound somewhat contrived because Sam's on the call. But when I came to Galaxy, I came from Goldman where I was running the crypto business and in my role as FX, COO. That's something of a career high for me. And then, when I joined Galaxy, I think there were certain things that didn't align with my expectations. It was something of a blip in my career. And it was a time when I really thought, ""I've been in these zero sum markets for several years. And how am I going to reinvent myself?"" And there was a moment in time when I felt like my only two friends were my 19 year old analyst at the time, and this guy, Sam, who really took a chance on me in saying, ""Hey, let's forge this amazing shared destiny together of, there's a lot of potential from Web 3.0, crypto and gaming. And let's go see if we can build a business around it.""I think sitting here three and a half years later, it's been pretty incredible to have the blessing of having raised $650 million in the space and hopefully more soon. We're just getting started. To have gone from that career trajectory where you feel like you're on top, but actually don't know anything. And then go and relearn everything you thought you knew, I think is a very healthy thing to go through. And one where, in this world that's changing so quickly, I'm just really grateful for having gone through that. Patrick: How about you, Sam? Sam: If it's not obvious, first of all, from Richard's answer, it's like I always describe him as the hundreds of venture investments, I guess in my life, I always describe Richard as the best venture investment that I ever made. It's like, it should be pretty obvious to everybody that got a chance to hear how his mind works and also, the humanity behind all of it. I've had the good fortune, I guess, of so many acts of kindness directed towards me over my life. I don't even know where to begin to pick one. It is like in so many ways, the blessing of my life, for sure that I've just had people that have been so wonderful to me. I mean, I think ultimately, if you think about in my case, having parents who never really put boundaries on all the crazy things that I wanted to do, or told me once that I couldn't go do them. And I was a very strange person growing up in terms of just getting obsessively, interested in a variety of extraordinarily random things. I mean, there was no way you could look at the stuff that I dove into over my life and make any real sense of it except to say I was curious. And fortunately, I had parents who just said, ""You know what? All right. You want to go do that? Go do it. And make it your own and do it well.""And in hindsight, that was really the kindest thing that anybody could have done. Because I think it was by them enabling me to just go explore that I was able to feed this curiosity that I've carried through in my life. And most importantly, it taught me to just find people that you care about and that you want to be on the journey with. That's manifested itself now, obviously with Richard and with a couple of great business partners I've had in my life. And my fiance, Megan. And it's just you learn, you look back and say, ""Well, okay. Am I happy where I am? Do I think I've figured out a pretty good way to pursue life?"" I think I've got to attribute that to the lessons I was fortunate to get from my parents. Patrick: As a dad, it resonates so much. And what's cool about the internet or the digital age is it feels like the opportunity to do well in niche curiosities is higher than ever and growing. And if anything... Sam: Absolutely. Patrick: It may even flip, where the best opportunities are not in the traditional past, but in the unusual past. Fostering that as a dad or as a parent is really important I think. Love it as a closing answer. Guys, this has been so much fun. Really appreciate the time today and all the lessons you've shared with us. Richard: Thanks, Patrick. Sam: Patrick, thanks so much for having us on. Richard: It was really great.This site uses cookies to improve your browsing experience. By using this site, you are consenting to this policy.",2114

265,Ricky Sandler - Building an Investment Compass,Leadership in Great Investment Firms," Patrick: Do you think that most great investment firms can or should be led by a single investor? Ricky: Patrick, thanks. Great to be here with you, and I believe that the answer to that is yes. I believe that somebody needs to be CIO, needs to own it. He or she needs to have really strong lieutenants who have a ton of responsibility, who can deploy capital. So it doesn't mean he's the only one deploying capital, but I think at the end of the day, management by committee is dangerous. I do believe that a single CIO structure is important, how that all fits into someone who could be chairman or the CIO, but you need accountability at the top to set kind of direction. Patrick: And how does that most manifest in a productive way, meaning maybe in a way that would be harder by committee or with co-CIOs or something like that? Like what are the episodes where that power becomes the most valuable in your experience? Ricky: So I'd say, one, I think there is one person who is viewing all the opportunities across all the different sectors or analysts and is able to say like, ""I know that's a really good idea to you, but I have six other ideas over here that are better and you don't see that you're just looking at this world."" So that's one. I think two, some single person at the top who's working with other people begins to see his people's biases. And some people come in pounding the table, pounding their chest, great debaters, and their idea is actually mediocre, and some people come in, ""I kind of think this is a pretty good idea, I mean, there's some risks."" Knowing your tools and people is important and that is hard when you're more decentralized in terms of decision making.And maybe the last point is I think an investment committee could lead to consensus think and ways that are not as good. I love debate by committee and we have three sectors that we view the world from, consumer, TMT, and we call it FIBHO, which is financials, business services, industrials, healthcare, other, because that's kind of how our portfolio... And we have sector meetings every week and we debate among a group of six to nine people. And I love that, but ultimately I think decisions at the top are important. Patrick: I love the idea that Paul Enright taught me, which is that a CIO can be a great analyst, but often, the skill of allocating capital across a set of ideas in the way you've described is quite a distinct skill from being a great individual security analyst. Which do you think you're personally better at and which do you enjoy more? Like where do you get your joy in the investing process on a repeated basis? Ricky: It's an interesting question because I love digging into the stocks, but I think I'm good at zooming out and getting out of the weeds. So I think I'm better as an allocator than I would be as a digger and someone that's doing FOIA requests and walking trade shows. I'm better at having good people who do that, seeing those things. As a CIO investor, I'm much more of, ""That's a great idea,"" not, ""Let's go buy tech stocks or healthcare."" I have some of those big picture views. I'm a individual company person at heart. That helps me help them the most because I can kind of distinguish between pretty good and great and add a different perspective to the whole debate. Patrick: How do you do that? You love the individual companies, you've got a talented team bringing you great ideas, how do you help them? And in what ways are you better at that via experience than you were maybe at the start and 10 years ago or whatever? What is that skill that you're bringing? What are you literally doing to bring the best out of them? Ricky: I'm a heavy participant in these sector meetings and kind of direct them. And so my ability to boil things down to important things, shift the discussion to what will really be important for the business and for the stock I think adds a lot to the discussion. And I think having both seen so much over my 30 years plus in the business and seeing also lots of different sectors and different things, I think I'm good at distilling that and then hopefully helping them distinguish between I could sort of say pretty good and great. And I was an analyst first, so I can start picking through their models and look at the cash flow statement and say I'm kind of getting to the weeds of things as well.I think it's that longer term perspective. I think the key is you go over time. We all have a lot of wisdom and experience from all the different things we had and it's important that we don't get too colored by the wins and scars because you can have too many ends of one or two, but draw broad conclusions and things that generally work or generally don't work, but also have younger people around you to kind of challenge you sometimes to your close-minded, ""I don't buy those kinds of businesses,"" or, ""This always works."" And I think that's the push and pull of someone at the top and a team of younger people who I say a lot of value in naive energy, someone who loves an idea and it's a little bit naive, but it can open your mind to a different way to look at something. Patrick: And this could be in today's environment or just more generally, what are the most common types of what I'll call fool's gold that you encounter that you've been trained to recognize? Meaning an analyst brings you something for some set of reasons or whatever, it's something where you say, ""Yeah, yeah, I realize why you think this looks good, but here's the reality or the thing you're not considering,"" or whatever. If you think of fool's gold conceptually, what comes most to mind? Ricky: So one I think classic one is comping a stock or evaluation to itself, to another set of businesses or to a period of time, which is just a period of time. And evaluations move a lot and I think that an analyst can get anchored into... A very recent example is these high growth companies have corrected to pre-COVID valuations. And I might say actually pre-COVID valuations for growth stocks were pretty high. If you look back three or four years before that, they didn't trade there. Now, that might have been wrong, this might have been wrong, but anchoring it like, ""It used to trade here. And so if it gets back to this multiple, this is where it could trade.""So I think that's kind of one common mistake that people make. I think the other one is this notion that we're just trying to buy great businesses that great things happen to and we're trying to short bad businesses, that bad businesses happen to. And the problem with that is if it's priced like a great business and it turns out to be just shy of a great business, you're going to earn a subpar return, and if it's bad and it turns out to be a little bit better than bad, you're going to lose a bunch on the short side.There's inherent expectations that we are in the stock business, which over a very long period of time, yes, stocks move in line with businesses, but they do so much of this and that. And if you think about an investment timeline, I tend to think of our longs on like a three year basis. And that's pretty long in today's environment. The dislocations from this, ""I just own a business that's going to grow for 10 years,"" I mean, I see this a lot on Twitter, like, ""I'll take this portfolio 10 years from now,"" I'm like, ""Do you know how long 10 years is? Do you know how many you're going to have to stomach big changes? Do you know how much the real world changes in 10 years?""Google was created like a little over 20 years ago. 10 years is a really long time. And I'm a long-term investor, I think about businesses that way, but I do think that that notion that we're just trying to buy good and short bad is a bit of fool's gold and we're to buy mispriced securities and short disappointments and things that are going to underwhelm their investor base. That's what we're trying to do. We're trying to buy mispriced securities among a subset of ownable businesses. So I don't want to buy bad businesses, but I think that's a big thing that I see, particularly among the last five to 10 year investor base because they haven't seen as many cycles.",1935
266,Ricky Sandler - Building an Investment Compass,Identifying Opportunities in Mispricings," Patrick: I think it's so important to point out that while buying great businesses has been great in this past X period of time, a big chunk of that return if you decompose it is multiple expansions. So my friend Carl Kawaja says everything eventually trades for 12 times earnings. Apple did and Microsoft did and all these companies did. And at the start of this great run where the lesson seems to be buy the great businesses, you have to realize a huge chunk of that return is going from five time sales to 40 times sales or something like that. And so mispriced security becomes the key term here, which leads me to the really important question of the pricing mechanism itself. I know you've thought a lot about market structure, market participants, the actual investors and their strategies that set prices. So if it's ultimately mispricing, a price setting mechanism is really important and the participants are really important. So talk me through that evolution because it's changed so much in your career and the state of it today is critical to success. Ricky: I'll start with the answer and then work backwards a little bit. Stock prices are moving around in a much bigger way, much more frequently on non-fundamental things and are much more divorced from fundamental value in a much bigger way than at any point in my career. If we just said, ""Pick these four or five companies, bring in Bain, McKinsey, and two great investors to kind of give you a fair value,"" the number of things that would be way above and way below and how far they'd be is way wider today. That is a great thing for an investor on the long side, I'll get into this in a second, it poses a challenge for an investor on the short side, I'll talk about that, and it's all caused by, I think, changing market structure.What's happened is, in short, the bottoms up fundamental investor is basically irrelevant in the daily trading and the daily movement of stock prices, maybe except for in the couple of weeks before and the couple weeks after a major earnings event or something like that. Call that two thirds or more, 75% of the time, they're kind of irrelevant, maybe 80%. We've gone from 20% or 25% passive to 55% passive investing today. That means that a lot of the market is just price accepters, price takers. It's there and I just continue it. Of the 45% that are supposed to be active, we now have quant funds, ESG funds, retail investors, momentum investors, macro investors. We have a lot of people who are not bottoms up fundamental investors.And so the world of I think what adds the most value is a small world. Now, that's a wonderful thing. If you told me competition in your business went down a ton, which is what I would tell people, you'd be like, ""God, that's amazing,"" and yet everyone's like, ""It's so hard out there. Investing is hard."" like talk through it because we lived in a world where the market gave us signals. If a stock was acting poorly, there was some chance that somebody knew that they were going to miss numbers. Now it's like random. And if the same stock is acting well, you're like, ""People are figuring out my thesis,"" and it could be just random now, or these other players.Random makes it sound even worse. People doing things for different reasons, a macro investor, an ESG investor, a pod who's using it as a part of a short basket to neutralize its factors. I mean, there's just big, big players out there that are not bottoms up fundamental investors. So that has created all this mis-pricing. And for a longer term investor on the long side, this should be purely positive. Why is that? Well, if I think the stock's going to go from 10 to 20 and it goes to six first, I have less risk on the table. I can buy more. If I did my work, it's easy to buy more and you end up with more alpha if it ends up at 20. If I think it's go from 10 to 20 and it goes to 17 in two months, it's a bigger position. I can sell it naturally. I can turn my capital and use the volatility to my advantage.The inverse is not true on the short side. If I think a stock's going to go from 20 to 10, okay, but it goes to 30 first, I have a bigger position. I have more a risk on the table. I actually can't add. I might have to subtract. I know I have unlimited risk, I might get scared out. That dislocation creates a portfolio construction challenge. Obviously we're seeing, whether it's the meme stocks or the retail investors or other things that are going on where there's a lot of new investors who don't do the kind of work that we do setting stock prices that creates a total construction challenge.So I think this is a definite change over my career that exists today. It's great for the long side. And the keys are, number one, use volatility to your advantage. Don't think the market is smarter than you if you've done your work. The market is giving you less and less signals today than it ever has. And then on the short side, we've had to rethink our portfolio construction some to navigate this, but it's like theoretically good, but practically doesn't work that way because of how short positions get bigger. So now you've got more risk on the table and you have unlimited open risks. So it just could that different set of practical considerations. Patrick: We've spent a ton of time, I think rightly so, with guests in the past talking through the principles of good and bad businesses, which you've mentioned is, in the long side, let's say, necessary but not sufficient for a great investment. You'd want good or great and a company with at the big mispricing, right? Would be the sort of the Goldilocks scenario. I'd love to do that same walkthrough, not about company quality, but about what I'll call mispricing quality, but in the same way that we can describe certain features, common features of a good business. What are common features of a good mispricing in your view? Ricky: I think when you can look at the other side, the narrative, the supply demand of the stock and say I know why this stock is trading here, they've had decelerating revenue for five quarters. I know people in the sector don't like to own decelerating revenue, or there's been margin pressure. By the way, I think that's going to change. So I think it's mispriced. Being able to visualize that while the stock is mispriced, you understand what is mispricing it. To me, that's the most clear thing, but sometimes it's simple supply demand like a distribution. A lot of sellers, a company was spun out and IPO'd and then a company distributed all its shares and there could just be simplistically supply and demand that can do it. Sometimes there are events like investors hate uncertainty. And so, if there's a legal issue or other things that could create a probabilistic big mispricing. IE, the market is pricing this like a 50/50 event, but it's a 90/10 event, but just because the uncertainty.So I think there's certain things in human emotion. I think we do know following a period of earnings disappointments, you get investors who believe that A, there's a negative price momentum. B, a negative earnings momentum. People don't trust management and there begins this whole narrative. This is a bad company and every company goes through ups and downs. And so, understanding the human emotion elements I think can be part of it. So there's a few recurring examples of it, but ultimately it comes down to I understand the guy on the other side. He's totally wrong. He's doing things for other reasons, but I understand it. Those are the best cases of dispricing, because not only do you understand why the stock is where it is, but think you have a path to that change.",1763
267,Ricky Sandler - Building an Investment Compass,The Professional Investing Landscape," Patrick: I can probably name on not that many hands, the number of other active equity investors with a pool of capital as big or bigger than yours. People would recognize their names. How do you interact with those people? If at the end of the day there is quite a bit of concentration in terms of who is allocating the big pools of capital, those people matter in setting prices. And you're part of that landscape and they're your competitors, but maybe they're your friends and frenemies or whatever. Talk me through the dynamic of your social interaction or professional interaction with the other big hedge fund and long-only investors. Ricky: I love to talk to other investors that I think are reasonably smart and sometimes different than me, because I begin to understand some of these dynamics we just talked about, like why stock will be trading here and you have someone else who's got a different framework. I go to a lot of idea lunches and dinners. I have conversations with other big market participants. A lot of times, not even about stocks. So I can go to lunch with a peer and we can talk about analyst process and compensation and business aspects. I talk to a lot of young people because I teach a class up at University of Wisconsin and I talk to a lot of young people. And one of the things I always say is, ""Find your own investing compass because you got to be comfortable with it."" And so you're going to meet all these people and talk to all these people and you're going to hear all these things. You're not going to recreate the wheel, but you're also not going to be just like Warren Buffett or just like Stan Druckenmiller. You might pick a few things and you create Patrick's investing compass.This is what I believe in. And part of why that's important is because you need conviction amidst volatility and you've developed it over time. I learned from other people, both investing things and business things. I'll share with you one of your prior podcasts, Steve Mandel. And I had a Zoom with him a couple weeks ago because I reached out on a business related issue. We didn't even talk about markets or stocks. I like that and I think understanding the other players in the game and how they think, learning from other people, even if it's little pieces, I'm an open book to other people. What do we own? Why are we doing it? It is such a big world of capital out there that I don't think my great ideas of running a business and running a portfolio, you have to actually be able to execute it and there's an art to it. And I don't worry that somehow there's some great secrets out there. It's kind of putting it all together that's more important. Getting the right inputs is important. Patrick: What investor comes to mind as someone that is either just really different than you or you often or mostly disagree with, but you nonetheless can't wait to talk to each time you do? Ricky: I have on different ends of the spectrum. There are more deep value types, like a David Einhorn who's had great success and then been through a bit of a tougher period, but is still a really thoughtful person. I wouldn't say I always disagree with him, but I... Different philosophy and we might only have a name or two in common. They'd be at both ends of the spectrum. And then there's the super high growth. I put my former boss in this camp of owning great high growth, best companies and how he thinks, and I like that aspect and he's incredibly thoughtful. And there's other investors like Steve Mandel that would do similar types of things. So for me, those extremes, I'm somewhere in the middle of the deep value guys and the high growth, great business guys or gals.",832
268,Ricky Sandler - Building an Investment Compass,Defining and Measuring Success," Patrick: How do you think about the investment that you're most proud of historically? Maybe tell that story or the episode around it. Ricky: I've been managing for 27 years and there's so many stories. I would say Green Mountain is one that comes to mind because it was a controversial name. We had done a lot, a lot of research. Not only was it our biggest position and we owned some call options, but I pitched it at a couple of big conferences. And then relatively in short order, they got taken over for an 80% premium by a really smart group that validated the work we had done. And I would say, this is a recurring theme for us where there is a growth company that goes through its difficult period. You can look at Peloton today and say it might be going through something similar where it's good, has great growth, people think it's amazing. And then something happens and it starts to come down.So I think Green Mountain, Keurig and at home coffee, single serve coffee, they invented that category or at least dominate that category. And I think that a combination of factors caused some growth to slow. There were patents that were expiring that were going to crush competition. They were going into the cold business if you remember, and people were like, ""See, this business is bad."" And people were actually capitalizing the losses in cold into the earnings. So they weren't looking at just shut that down. And Green Mountain was spending a ton on CapEx. So the nitpicky value guys were burning a lot of money, but Green Mountain was building a manufacturing capability to be able to serve the people that everybody thought was going to compete with them and provide a bunch of services and be the low cost manufacturer, in addition to being able to get some fee for the system, even if the patent went away.And so we could see the core business of selling pods and earning a profit per pod was doing well and was going to continue. And everybody was all caught up in a zillion other things, losses on cold, new competition, CapEx. And going back to what I said it to you, I could understand the other side, why they were doing that and I could also understand why they were missing all this. And this is one that got rewarded big and fast. And a lot of them take a lot more patience. I had the confidence because I could really understand why people disliked it. I think one of the things that for us is really good, I think being short sellers makes us better on the long side. So I could pick through these issues that people had and say, ""No, it's not an issue."" Or, ""There's a reason for that and you're missing the good reason,"" or whatever. Patrick: There's no getting away from the fact that this is ultimately a very P&L driven business. Success is pretty clearly objectively defined one way or the other. So obviously that is part of the motivation. And a lot of the people that have done really wellness in this get really wealthy. They make a lot of money. And I'm curious how you think about motivation. If P&L is ultimately the scoreboard that matters in this business, is that the right motivation? What is the thing that keeps you coming back to the well that's healthy that you think is a good thing? And are there examples of things that kept you coming back to the well that maybe you think were bad in hindsight as the type of motivation for investing as a career? Ricky: Yeah, I think you're right in your supposition that P&L is the ultimate arbiter. I'm a very competitive person. I have been my whole life and one of the things that I loved about the business, I used to say is, ""They print the answer in the newspaper every day."" Now we don't actually read the stock charts anymore, but that was true when I started. And so I liked that ultimately we get to figure out who's right and wrong over time and what's right and wrong in P&L. I think for me, what started out as just a competitive drive to win and be better than other people and just have better performance, somewhere along the way in building eminence, I work with incredibly great people. They are smart, they're hard working, they're good people. We've gone to great lengths to hire really good people, train them.I'd probably take a different view of this than others, which is that this is not a commodity and it's not like if your P&L's bad, I turn you over. There's a cost to finding people, to hiring people, and then to training them and into trusting them. That's very high. And I also want to come in every day and love what I do, so I got to be around people that are like that. So somewhere along the way, it became about building a great firm that could endure beyond me. Part of that's going to be 40 year track record. You can't divorce yourself from P&L. You have to have a long enough horizon to measure that. What's the appropriate measurement? It's not daily, it's not monthly. Yearly's not terrible. Three years is pretty good. And beyond three years, you're probably getting a little too far afield. So there are some measurement issues, but I have this annual investor conference and I used to put up building a 30 year investment track record.But then a couple years ago I realized I was in year 21 or 22. I was getting close to that. And then I updated that to build an enduring investment management franchise. And I think part of it's that I think it's really hard. There's not a lot of people who have been able to build... At least in the hedge fund industry. It's probably been more true in traditional asset management where there's been handoffs. Doing something that's hard, IE 40 year track record and building something that can sustain, those are things that keep me motivated. And I build the structure into my life and day where I can work hard and still enjoy my life, which is important, having that balance for everybody. We have a gym in our office. I don't question people like, ""Where were you? You got to get your work done. You got to be productive, but you have your time."" So I think that helps attract the right people and have people stay. And so the six PMs that are below me have averaged probably 12 years in eminence.",1397
269,Ricky Sandler - Building an Investment Compass,The Future for Expensive Businesses," Patrick: One of the curiosity I have is just your view, given everything we've talked about on the phenomenon of crossover funds. And valuations more generally speaking, you've alluded to some of this. I think I know where you'll go with this answer, but give me your opinion on this style of investing. There's been so much capital raised and deployed into very late stage private businesses from investors that also do publics. What do you think's going to happen here? Ricky: I think the prospect of looking at public and private is fundamentally a good one. You get to compare and you can allocate capital one way or the other. And ultimately, the public market in the long run is going to be your arbiter of where all these private companies need to go. They need to sell to a strategic who needs to put it into their system and be public. They need to take it public and fully distribute it. So being in both, I think at a high level is really good. We have about 5% or 6% of our portfolio in privates and doing the research on these private companies, really important. These companies are disrupting your public companies up on the new trends. I think that part of it makes total sense to me and I'm a believer. I think where things got out of whack is in these private company valuations, I think that they were chasing a really small group of public company, growth companies and paying ever and ever higher prices and rounds D, going to rounds E, to rounds F.I say like, ""You guys can keep trading amongst yourselves, but when you come to the public markets, Google trades at 20 times earnings, and it's a phenomenal company. It's going to crush you all."" The thing, we have to get to some sense of real value. The other phenomenon that I hear from some people on crossover funds is investors say, ""Well, I don't have to hedge. I don't have to short against my private exposure."" And there's this notion I'm trying to fight against that somehow P&L volatility equals risk. And this is something that has changed in the market, but a long short fund that doesn't run like Citadel and perfectly match.If you run with some leverage, actually you have greater volatility now than you had before, maybe even greater than 100% long-only portfolio because shorts don't directly hedge longs as much anymore. But I wouldn't argue that that's greater risk. And the phenomenon that follows that is somehow these private companies that get marked once a quarter or less are less risky, which is insane because my stocks hit mark every day, and risking some young growth software company seems insane to me. I think this is the phenomenon that created the private equity industry, the fact that allocators want to keep moving money to private equity is 2008, we all had bad performance, but you could take your money from us. Private equity had smoother numbers and they couldn't take your money and they got the chance to make that back. And that created a cycle of that. So there's a fools errand in looking at P&L, and that's... I think going back to the crossover fund specific question, I think there are some people that own privates, they're not even hedging their privates with shorts because they don't mark to market and they think that that's the right thing to do.And I think we're going to enter the next two years where we're going to start to see private company markdowns. Not any specific crossover funds, but I do think when I look at private company valuations and where they're raising at. And then you can start to see the IPOs that they come, they trade up for 10 minutes, and they trade down. And ultimately they're going to have to fully distribute in the public markets and I think that will start to prove to people that paying these crazy multiples for young companies is very risky and probably not a good risk reward. Some may work out, but a lot may not. Patrick: I'll repeat it again. Carl Kawaja's idea, everything will eventually trade for reasonable earnings multiple at some point. That's where you got to end up. I'd love to take the lens that you've helped us understand that you see the world through. I understand this question's going to be a little weird, because fundamentally you care about companies and the opportunities that individual companies represent, but those boil up into something, right? The portfolio looks a certain way relative to the S&P 500 or whatever and I'm just always interested through, if you collect a unique lens and set of experiences, how you then view the world at any given point in time. So I'd love to hear you riff on that a little bit. What does the world of 2022 seem like to you, feel like to you? The things that get you excited. The things that have you worried. Just given that you've got a unique set of experiences, I'd love to hear your view on the world today. Ricky: I've said a bunch in the last month or two, this is going to be the year where real hedge funds are going to actually show their metal. And by that I mean, individual stock shorting, moderate long short ratio, using some balance sheet, using volatility to your advantage, not being a slave to the P&L. And the reason I think that is because this has characteristics that are very post-1999 to me. Some insane valuation, bubble, concept things that are going on, we can look at whether it's the IPOs that are happening in SPACs, the retail investors, the fact that people accepted 50 times sales for companies. It's just like, ""We're going to make a 10 bagger, and then we're just going to own it for 10 years."" Let's see how that plays out. You could have said that about Microsoft and Cisco the 1999. And they both did well in earnings, but for a decade or longer, you didn't make any money.You lost money. So price matters. The big distinction is that I think on November 15th, the Fed actually started withdrawing liquidity from the system or it became less easing. They talked about tapering, and then they talked about tapering and then they kind of... And if you look at when all this stuff peaked, that was actually when it peaked. I do think a lot of this was about liquidity, excess liquidity. And we are without question on the other side of something major. We had the most accommodative Fed anyone's ever seen or heard of or read about in history books for the past 18 months. We had massive stimulus from Congress in levels that no one could ever think about. And then now the Fed is going to be on a tightening cycle as far as the eye can see until one of two things happens, until either inflation is sustainably at 2% or lower and they can sort of believe that, or they hike too far and the economy has a problem. We're just on this path.And so that inflection point, I think is a really good one for fundamental investors. And beneath the surface, I think there's a lot of interesting longs and a lot of interesting shorts, and we've had this dislocation. So if you looked at what created the dawn of the hedge funds, it was the popping of the tech bubble in 1999. Guys had incredible years. We made good money in '99. We were 50% in 2000. We had a good 2001 while the markets were down. It was almost like your returns didn't bear any resemblance in the indices, and that the growth of the industry and up until the GFC, the industry did what it was going to do. And then the GFC created a whole new set of things that I could... This isn't just like that. There are differences and rates aren't as high and the companies are more real, and I'm not trying to say it's exactly, but there are a lot of parallels.And I also think that even with the Fed starting to tighten/raise rates, the economy's good enough. I don't think the market's done, but I think that you can pay anything as long as the fundamentals are going in one direction. We're dreaming to dream on electric vehicles, and somehow the whole electric vehicle complex has market caps that can't be justified based on 10 year out economics. It doesn't make any sense. That's going to come back to earth. So I think that's one real important framework for how I think about the next couple years. One anecdote I'll point to you is we have a long fund and a hedge fund. The long fund owns all the same longs as the hedge fund, just resized to a hundred percent. And we have a fee structure that's 75 basis points plus an out performance fee. And we have a hedge fund, which is very traditional, which runs with some leverage and lower net.And at many points along the way, if you just said, well, what should I go into, Patrick? Pick the hedge fund. It's got all the flexibility, we can use leverage, I can be short bonds. I can do all sort to clever things. And in late March of 2020, my hedge fund was 110% net long. The truth is that a lot of people, I said that my long fund's done better for the last several years. And not that the hedge fund's done poorly, but it's been pretty good while the long fund's been great. And I get this question again now, and I say, I would've been wrong telling you this, and I'm going to tell you this again, but the hedge fund is the better place now and it feels like the timing is more right. So that would be kind of my perspective. And I think the thing that's important, I think a lot of growth investors want to believe that multiple expansion came from low interest rates.And I think it came from two things. It came from economic uncertainty in 2017, 2018 and 2019, therefore people wanted to buy growth. And growth was actually expensive pre COVID, relatively speaking. Some of it justified, some of it not. And then it came from liquidity. And I think both of those things are different now. Liquidity is starting to come out. And actually we have more economic certainty with the strength of what's happened coming out of the pandemic and consumer balance sheets and savings. There's a lot of reasons why you feel pretty good about the earnings and you're not worried about broad economics. Now, if the Fed hikes too far too fast and kills the economy, we'll have to see how that all plays out. But that would be kind of my big picture view. Patrick: Can you say a bit more about, you mentioned liquidity a few times and its impact on maybe multiples/prices. What is the causal link or connection there? What's your model for thinking about where liquidity comes from or what changes it and how that flows through into equity prices? Ricky: I'm going to give you two answers here because I am famous for saying that liquidity is as much as a psychological phenomenon as it is a real phenomenon. Liquidity comes from availability of capital at banks, the cost of capital, and it comes from ultimately how easy it is to get credit, to be able to invest that money. And I think the that's maybe the ultimate, you can talk about Fed balance sheet and putting money into the system, and the ultimate economic answers I think lie in availability and cost of capital. Which real rates are still negative. Liquidity is still good, but it was the best we've ever seen at some point in time. Congress was going out and giving out six billion dollars to people. The Fed was buying up assets. 10 year rates got down to like 50 basis points. Credit spreads came all the way down.So cost and availability of capital, those are the real reasons. Those are the economic reasons. Liquidity is a psychological phenomenon at certain points in time, which is that your desire to take risk, your desire to actually borrow that money, invest in that capital project, look out an extra year in your earnings model, that is a psychological phenomenon. And I like to say the world is reflexive, and it is. Markets could take the economy down. If we have a bad stock market, eventually the next thing earnings start to come pressure. And it wasn't actually there, but that affects business leaders looking at the world and starting to make tighter decisions, tighter hiring, consumers having less money, and it feeds on itself. And I think liquidity has similar psychological phenomenons. If people are more risk averse, if they have trouble in their business or in their investments, they're less willing to make that next investment. I think there's a psychological element to it too.",2727
270,Ricky Sandler - Building an Investment Compass,The Most Interesting Sector Right Now," Patrick: Do you think that the, I can't remember your acronym, FIBO I think is what you called it. Everyone's become so enamored of consumer and TMT and technology and all this kind of stuff. Understandably so, right? It's become a dominant force in markets, market cap wise. But there's this big other group FIBO in your case, that seems to have been entirely forgotten. My favorite example is that when I started, energy was 12 or 13% of the market and today it's like 1% or something by market cap. It's crazy small. Talk us through that segment, getting back down to your bread and butter of individual companies and sectors, talk us through that part of the world through your eyes. Ricky: If I am to look top down, I would probably tell you I think healthcare may be one of the most interesting sectors right now that there is. And I'll tell you why. For the first time in all of our careers, healthcare became cyclical during COVID because the healthcare system was the center of COVID. So somehow the elective procedures, which were not cyclical because people didn't have money, they were cyclical because hospitals didn't allow you to come. Sales reps weren't allowed to visit doctors' offices. High growth healthcare and high growth tech, after we got through COVID diverged. Tech kept going up and healthcare went down. And I think we sit here now where a big piece of healthcare, which has reopened benefits and is actually going to have a snap back and grow up faster, but what's more interesting about healthcare than most reopening is after healthcare, after a company X, Y, Z has its reopen benefit, it becomes non-cyclical growth, which is kind of what you want.One of the challenges with reopening is you get the reopening and then maybe you don't own the greatest business in the world or a ton of growth, or what happens after that. So I think healthcare is really interesting and part because of what happened in COVID. I think financials are interesting for the same reason you said on energy. Nobody's made any money in this sector. It's been terrible. People kind of hate it. And we're very selective in financials and we own a few, but I do think it's hated. I think rates going up help. I think these companies, their balance sheets are a lot better and there are better businesses in there, what people remember. Industrial is kind of a big mix of everything. I actually think the guys that wrote the book on studying the Titans... Patrick: I just saw this. Yeah, I haven't read it yet. I know what you're talking about. Ricky: I'm halfway through listening to it. It's a great book for investors, because they talk about how the industrials... Patrick: Lessons from Titans is the name of the book. Ricky: That book, industrials covers everything from commodity things to great business servicey type businesses. And at periods in time, aerospace was young and growing. That was like a young tech industry, gas turbines. You can look at a whole lot of things in industrials and they were the tech of the old and went through their own cycle. So that's sort of an interesting sector. That's the ultimate bottoms up sector. If I were to tell a young person sector to go into when they're young, that would be the sector. It wouldn't be TMT. Businesses are so varied... You get a wide lens in that sector from great businesses like these business servicey, growth businesses to your ultimate commodity and cyclical businesses. And so you see it all.",822
271,Ricky Sandler - Building an Investment Compass,Advice for Aspiring Asset Managers," Patrick: You mentioned in this unusually long tenure that a lot of your team members have had with your firm. You mentioned some of the key players like pods, where the turnover, at Citadel or wherever else, is incredibly high. And it does seem more like these are very valuable commodities, but these positions are treated almost as commodities and can sort of turn through. With that in mind, what advice would you give to younger and investors out there? You just said go into industrials. Do you encourage young people to consider going into this sort of career that you've had and built, given all the changes in dynamics. And if so, what is relevant advice for them in today's world? Ricky: I do. I think markets continue to be more inefficient than anything we've ever studied in school, and that is a good thing for investors. I think this is a business, and industry you can continue to learn and it's very humbling. So I love it and I would encourage somebody. I think the advice I would give young people...One is what I mentioned to you before on finding your investing compass. Don't just try to be like one person. Try to take pieces about other people and figure out what you yourself can believe in and internalize and build your own investing framework out of that. The second piece of advice that I give young people is something that I didn't figure out to later in life and I could have done it a lot better is start building a network thoughtfully. What does that mean? That means that when you meet people and you're going to get introduced to different people who can be helpful, it's probably up to you to start to maintain that relationship. And that doesn't mean being a pest.Every once in a while. Hey, I read this article and I thought about you and one of the things you said, goes a long way to building your network. And then on most cataloging people among industries and expertise. Because as we go on and do our research, drawing on people's experiences and expertise is really, really helpful. And when I was young I got introduced to a ton of executives and I worked at Mark Asset Management, the top executives at Viacom and Time Warner. And I didn't do a great job at keeping those relationships, and I could have. And they respected me for asking good, smart, analytical questions.I think being thoughtful about that and being proactive about that is a really good piece of advice. And then maybe the last thing I would say is, who you work for is more important than where you work. Take investment banking, which is what a lot of young investors start as a stepping stone. I would much rather work for really good group of people at Jefferies or Ladenburg than I would work for someone that didn't care that much at Goldman. And I think young people get enamored with brands and other things. Ultimately, you're at this phase in your career where the people that you work for and their interest in you is really, really important. Patrick: This has been such an interesting conversation, I think, because of your compass that you've developed, that you've described. You have a different take on not just overall markets, but sort of the style of which we invest and what we're seeking, the good pricing versus the good business as an example, relative to a lot of the investors that have become very in this cycle. So it's a refreshing conversation. I ask the same closing question of everybody that I talk to. What is the kindest thing that anyone's ever for you? Ricky: I've had a lot of kind things done for me. So my current wife, we've been only married a year, who has been incredible to me and incredibly helpful to me as we started dating, and I was going through a divorce after 24 years and three grown, but not grown children and also trying to run a business and a lot of other things. And she was just incredibly understanding and compassionate about the difficulties of all that stuff and helped me a ton through a very difficult personal period to also be able to do my day job, which has run the business and run evidence. Patrick: Wonderful place to close. Ricky, it's been so much fun. Thank you so much for your time. Ricky: Great to be here. Thank you.This site uses cookies to improve your browsing experience.

272,Orlando Bravo - The Art of Software Buyouts,Introduction," Patrick: My guest today is Orlando Bravo, co-founder and managing partner of a leading private equity firm, Thoma Bravo. Thoma Bravo manages over $90 billion of assets and is best known for investing in software and technology businesses. It was Orlando who led the firm's early entry into software buyouts some 20 years ago, and he has overseen more than 350 software acquisitions since. There are few, if any, people better-placed to discuss private equity and software investing. Please enjoy this excellent discussion with Orlando Bravo.",117
273,Orlando Bravo - The Art of Software Buyouts,Opportunity Set vs. Capital Flows," Patrick: Orlando, when we talked the other day, we were kind of fishing for places to begin this conversation. The one thing that stood out probably more than anything to me was this notion that there are probably more opportunities for great return in private equity than there is capital, in terms of committed capital in traditional fund structures. It just seems like a very strange idea in what seems like a bountiful period of capital availability. I'd love you to expound on that idea to begin here. What's behind that opportunity capital mismatch that you see today? Orlando: Well, Patrick, first of all, thank you so much for having me. Patrick: My pleasure. Orlando: I really appreciate it. Look, the proof is in the numbers. You see growth equity investors, whether they come from private equity world, venture world or hedge fund world, investing those growth equity funds in a period of nine to 12 months. Then on top of that, you see what you would call the traditional private equity community, the control investors, that would take usually four to five years to fully invest the fund doing it in 12 months, 24 months. We at Thoma Bravo have always invested fast and sold fast. There are many, many, many reasons for that, but now you see the whole community doing that. The reason is the market, both for private equity and obviously for growth investing, is becoming much more tech-oriented. These tech companies are going public and are achieving scale faster than you could raise capital to go out and invest in them, and that is only going to get worse. Even if you look at assets that are at scale, at a billion dollars plus, they're now compounding in the SaaS world at 20%, which means they'll double every four years. It's more of an issue of where do you decide to spend your time to go invest or buy business? Patrick: How do you think about it from the perspective of Thoma Bravo and the challenge you have in front of you, which is you have to raise funds? You have to have those funds be reasonably diversified. The size of the equity checks may be growing. You mentioned it's crazy that some of these companies are doing two, three billion dollars of revenue in what might seem like a niche area and growing fast. How do you adjust your business and your model to be able to take advantage of these opportunities? Orlando: Well, our philosophy has remained the same since we started doing software 22 years ago. The tactics are always evolving. On the one hand, the investing tactics, the deal tactics and the operating tactics have evolved within the same philosophy umbrella about them. Investing, the challenge 10 years ago was winning the deal and finding the right deal. Deal pipeline generation was a big thing, and then your win rate was, obviously, extremely important. Now, the challenge is, it's more of an investing challenge, out of all the opportunities out there, which one do you decide to focus on? What are the top three or four in our private equity business that we want to buy this year and why? To think that through, it gets even more complicated, because we look at this as a positive, but over the last five years, we have been buying growth, not earning returns through just operational improvements, it's earning returns through that, plus being correct on growth. That's harder to do as well. Now, the market is serving us, on the other hand, these phenomenal growth companies that did not exist 15 years ago in software. Patrick: How would you describe the difference between the kinds of businesses, software businesses, that you're focused on versus those that are traditional, later-stage growth equity investor, maybe coming from hedge fund world or from the VC community that has become so dominant and so popular in the last 12, 18 months? What are you doing most differently from those more minority type, but late-stage growth investments in some mature tech businesses? Orlando: Well, first of all, in our private equity business, we are also involved in growth equity investing from a perspective of buying a minority interest, these companies that will be market leaders. The biggest investing difference is in our Flagship Fund. We are buying the market leaders of today, the number one player in that vertical market in the case of apps, or even horizontal market, or the market-leading company in infrastructure software, or the number one player in different segments of cybersecurity. But the most important difference is, where do we get the source of our returns from? In our Flagship Fund and in our private equity in our control business, we are looking to fundamentally improve the way that companies run both bottom-line and top-line acceleration. We do that only in partnership with the existing management teams of these companies. It is a very fundamental approach to operations, which is very intensive. For example, every month we have an ops review at each of our companies for four hours, at least, with a CEO and all of her or his direct reports. We are there looking to solve operating problems by being creative and inspiring existing management to think differently about operations. They know their businesses so well. They know their markets incredibly well. They have the following of their employees, but we bring to them an approach that is different, and hopefully, very value-add to their already existing activities. Patrick: How do you run one of those four-hour meetings? Is it really standardized across the firms? Just give me an outline of how those are run and operated themselves, the meetings. Orlando: It really is standardized, and it's not that different from what you would see the best strategic buyers run their different business units. What we do is we have... Our board meeting is very short, because those are approval processes, those are general items that the board, given its corporate duties and fiduciary duties needs to get through. We start with that so we can get that out of the way. Then what we do is we review the P&L of every functional area of that business, whether it's customer support, professional services, marketing, sales. We review the P&L and the activities, in case the company's organized differently, of every business unit, of every geographical area. We do that with all of the direct reports of the CEO together in the room, because they have to collaborate through this. Everybody owns their area, but it's tied to everything else. We're constantly looking at best-in-class metrics for each of these functional business units or geographical areas. We're also able to engage in a creative dialogue with the leader of those areas in terms of how improve it, so that then we can take more of those profits and reinvest them in growth. That's the model that we pursue. Patrick: Would you take us all the way back to the very first deal? I think Prophet 21 was the name of the firm that you did in the software world. I want to start there, because obviously, this has become an absolute dominant trend in the world of investing, of businesses, et cetera. But back then, when you did your first one 22 years ago, it was a very different situation. I think the evolution from then to now is really important for people to understand. Talk us through the unique dynamics of that deal, how you came to it, how you got the idea, how it was financed. I know that was very different back then. I would love to hear the story of the first technology software deal that you did. Orlando: Prophet 21 was a deal that our team originated because we had an investment team at the time after the dot-com bubble burst in 2000. We were looking to do something different than all of private equity, really. We were searching for it. Carl Thoma, my mentor, was open-minded enough to allow us to do that. The theme that we had at the time was you can buy software maintenance streams... remember, it was all on-premise two years ago... you can buy software maintenance streams less expensively than almost any other form of recurring revenue in different industries, media, radio, which was popular then, transaction processing, and that quality of that revenue is even more sticky than those categories. Now, the challenge was that that universe, which is a challenge today, by the way, but the challenge then, having us not done that before, was that these companies were unprofitable, especially coming out of that bust that happened in the year 2000. We had to say, theoretically, with 90% gross margins, these businesses can be high cashflow generative, and therefore good candidates for a fundamental control-type investing.In doing our work, we came across Prophet 21. The company was for sale. We were able to succeed, actually, without much competition. That was interesting. It was one of those unusual deals where there was not that much competition, even though there were players starting in the software industry back then that were very good and had similar ideas as we had. It was interesting, because that company had never made money before. Now, it wasn't losing all kinds of money. It was close to break-even, so management did care about that. That wasn't a completely irrelevant concept to them. Secondly, the company had never done a lateral acquisition and the company had inconsistent performance. We bought the business and part of the reason was the price looked great at around two times maintenance revenue, one times two. Imagine, remember those days. Patrick: Charming. Orlando: Exactly, those were the days. We decided through meeting the person that became chairman of our operating committee, that the best approach was to back existing management for all the reasons that I mentioned before that existing management has. They really wanted to win, but have them work with our operating partner in terms of improving that company. Of course, three years later, you end up with a success story, a five margin, good growth, six software acquisitions, and it was a great investment. That experience really made us very passionate about the possibility of working with existing management that deeply cares about that business, that doesn't move from company to company, that lives in that environment. They provided software for small and mid-market distributors, so they knew all the distribution customers, they knew the culture, they knew how they talk, how they trade, how you have to discount it. They know that world and were good at it. If you can marry that with an operational approach... as my partner would always say, ""Everybody needs somebody to learn from""... if you can marry that with what we would bring, you would not only have the possibility of great success, but also it was a good approach to doing business. It felt really good. Then we did a second deal, and the same thing happened with existing management, and then a third one and so on and so forth, so we quickly developed this as our mission.",2369
274,Orlando Bravo - The Art of Software Buyouts,Software Investing Philosophy," Patrick: I'd love to zoom out and talk about the software industry, maybe even the enterprise SaaS-specific sector of it, where you've done a lot of your work and some of the weird features of it. You mentioned some of these businesses have 90% gross margins. Everyone herald's software as like the best business model ever, but I think the average public market business, or maybe even the private market ones, they lose a lot of money still. Obviously, there're reasons for that, but I'd love you to just walk through what seems like a huge dissonance between the average SaaS company and the type of company that you're trying to run and manage. Orlando: There is no difference in the business model between that average and what we're looking to do. In essence, when you see us buy control of the business, we are underwriting our plan, not what is going on in that company. In many cases, we're buying break-even businesses or businesses that may be losing money. That's not the way it's going to be run in partnership with management going forward, because the model would break and you couldn't support some debt into that transaction, which is highly creative. The challenge is for the market inefficiency here is that public investors who are extremely smart, creative, highly-educated, and great, for some reason they believe that ""investing in growth"" is the same and goes hand-in-hand with losing money and having a negative margin. Those two concepts are completely different. They many times have nothing to do with one another, and many times high profitability leads to higher growth because what high profits means, really, is that first you have operating management that innovates correctly, that runs those different functional areas in a way that is operationally sound. They measure all their activities. They look at inputs versus outputs. They readjust to what is working. Being highly profitable also means that you have a good enough product and you're charging a price for that product that allows you to produce that profitability, where for example, the yearly increase in the value of that product merits a price increase that is higher than your labor inflation, a key point today in this inflationary world. If you do that really, really well and you provide so much value to your customers that you capture some of that in your price, and every day you become better at your operations because you learn from the past and you're actually measuring this, it means that you have more money to invest in tactical growth, which is sales and marketing or distribution and more money to invest in strategic growth, which is product development, R&D and new initiatives.See, when you're highly profitable and you're growing very fast, it also means that management is making the right investment decisions in growth. You're an investor. You see all kinds of different sales channels. Well, if you lose money and you can lose money, sure, you'll try it all. You'll try direct sales, channel sales, inside sales, web sales, marketing. You can try all kinds of marketing plays. When you're really profitable, it means you're doing the right ones that fit your product and your business and what your customers need. The same thing is in R&D. You could have 20 R&D initiatives, and if one works and you grow really fast, that's great. But how about the other 19? I can get really passionate about this. The other fallacy that I see with investors in this space is saying, ""Well, this company's growing really fast now. It's 200 million in ARR, which is plenty of scale by the way to run it profitably, and I'm going to model what management told me, which was a 30% operating margin in year four. I understand why they're losing a lot of money now is they're growing at 50%."" But see, the operating world doesn't work that way. That company in year four is not all of a sudden going to change how they plan, how they think about initiatives, how they tell their direct reports what's important and what's not. It just doesn't work that way. They'll never get there. You've got to start now to get there. Patrick: What do you think most explains... I think I have these numbers roughly right... the average SaaS company, maybe in the category has a slightly negative EBITDA margin, losing money on an EBITDA basis? I think probably your portfolio is closer to 35 or 40% EBITDA margin today. That's a huge gap. What are the major explanations that make up that 40%? I mean, you've started to talk around some of the attitude differences, but literally, where do you think that change in margin most comes from versus the average SaaS company out there that's loss-making? 1 Orlando: I think that comes from investors really incenting management teams, just on top line. We work in a free market, capitalist, incentive-based system. If you're running a company and your investors tell you, ""I don't care about the bottom line at all. Go grow revenues as quickly as you can,"" that's the directive from the shareholders and that's what's most likely going to happen. Now, those investors, at what point in time did they become indoctrinated with this business model? We could have a philosophical discussion about that. Patrick: Yeah. I'd love to hear. Orlando: Right. Is it that early-on VCs, teach these companies that way in order for them to, of course, grow in winning their markets? That's the great thing to do, but also by doing that, do these companies need to raise more money and therefore there's more room for investors to get the equity and then so on and so forth? It's very interesting. One of the things that's just so important to say is we believe in both high growth and high margin, and they're not mutually exclusive. One actually drives the other, because when you also get growth, you should drop to the bottom line a higher margin than your existing margin in your business. In software where you have the marginal cost of your product is nearly zero, you do have to provide support, and of course, you have to pay for the distribution. Patrick: If the business models fundamentally are the same and we're dealing with companies that all have high or very high gross margins, where does the most mis-investment tend to cluster and happen, or is it just spread out? Like are people over-investing in R&D and trying too many things and over-investing in, as you said, different sales channels that maybe aren't smart and profitable just to get top-line growth? Are there most common mistakes that you see amongst these companies that are sort of mis-investing capital for sake of revenue growth only? Orlando: It depends on the project. This is, as you know, a project-based business, so we don't subscribe to the view of applying 500 things to every single company. We subscribe to the view of every company's different, every culture's different, and what are the top three, at most, things that need to be done in order to make this a successful operating investment, fundamental investment? The thing that I can tell you in general is so many of these companies, since they have such high gross margins and are winning in their marketplace are making a lot of decisions based on gut feel. Gut feel has served these companies well. If not, they wouldn't have been the market leaders that they are today. There's, once again, nothing wrong with that. What we see that we bring to them is an analytical approach to decision-making, everything being guided by the data and the numbers. Now there's a big exercise in being able to gather the right data by functional area, business unit area, geographic area, because you have big buckets of revenue, big buckets of costs. You have allocations. You have all kinds of complexities. When you let those operators know where exactly do they stand on direct revenue and direct cost in their activities, what they do creatively always exceeds our recommendations, even on top of our metrics and processes, many of which are relatively widely-known by the great companies out there. Once again, it's coming back to desegregating these P&Ls to give people the visibility of how their decisions are impacting the profit and loss statement. Patrick: You mentioned when we talked last, the notion of market leader being incredibly important as a term and concept for the type of firm that you target. Maybe just describe in as much detail as you can what market leader means. I mean, there's probably some obvious definitions, most revenue in a category or something, but what are the dimensions of the concept of market leader to you and the firm? Orlando: It's a different question in software than it is in many industries, given the fast pace of innovation. For us, it's the best product in however we have defined or the industry has defined that software sell market. That is really, really important, because these product cycles do take a lot of time. In the SaaS software world, especially around cyber, CIOs don't want to buy chief security officers, chief information officers, don't really at the end of the day want to buy five, six, seven, eight products in the market. These are extremely important strategic solutions and they will converge on the top two or three over time. Making that product call in these companies is very, very important to us. That's where the investing and sector knowledge comes in to help make that decision. Patrick: It's really interesting if you look at and aggregate your portfolio, it's probably bigger than any cyber company that exists in aggregate. It's one of the biggest software portfolios in the world. But when you dig in and look at some of the portfolio companies, probably most people wouldn't recognize the majority of these companies despite their significant size. I think some of that's because of the emphasis on cyber insecurity. Maybe you can just walk through why that sub-sector has been such fertile ground for you, and maybe why more people aren't able to name these companies. I mean, it's sort of a strange dissonance that you've got this massive portfolio, the returns have been spectacular, the margins are what they are, and yet there's less familiarity with this space and the business model. Orlando: What a great point. It's a bit of a source of frustration when taking companies public because of that, because these are heavy enterprise technical solutions to corporate customers. It could be SMB, small, medium-size business customers or it could be the largest companies in the world, but these are not therefore consumer household names. You can't go to a cocktail party and ask somebody about how their kids are using Snapchat or not and have those continuous discussions. Be a user or a consumer of them. For that reason, actually, the public markets, that 2.7 trillion market cap that is sitting in the SaaS world today, there's a lot of valuation and efficiency around these companies because when things get volatile... I know, so we always say volatile means down. Nobody says the market's volatile when it's going up. Well, that's like a Wall Street, maybe, broker term to not scare their clients that was developed. But when the market is down and things are bad and public investors are trying to figure out what they own, some of these names get left behind because how much time did they have to understand them, when there's so many of them and they provide complex solutions. They're also in the world of extremely smart public investors on highly competitive market for returns. Given the growth that enterprise software has had, there's a lack of investors that just specialize in this. You'll see TMT groups, you'll see tech groups within these public investment firms, but do you see just enterprise software only? Typically, not. Now, that's a limitation on what we believe are some great assets that are out there, but that's also an opportunity for others to focus on.",2613
275,Orlando Bravo - The Art of Software Buyouts,Private Equity & Future Return Potential," Patrick: Maybe say a little bit about the evolving nature of just like the private equity fund world itself, its size, it's opportunity, the opportunity for return. Maybe we start with SoftBank. SoftBank seems to be the whipping boy for people making fun of their fund size and their presentations, but maybe they got something right in terms of how much capital they formed to be able to go after some of these big opportunities. What do you think about that landscape today, sort of the private equity fund size and competitive landscape? Orlando: Look, at first when they have that big scene, that size fund to do my minority investing, I have to admit that I was skeptical about it. Now, I am highly impressed with the whole thing. It was very forward-looking and visionary to say the world of technology and software, it's going to create these massive companies that are going to stay private longer, and that have huge hands and there's room here for a differentiated, very large source of capital that can move quickly and entrepreneurially in order to serve the needs of this new world. I'm highly impressed with it. I don't know the details of the performance, so I can't comment on that, but the concept now just makes perfect sense to me, and I view it as quite visionary at the time, I guess, hence the fund's name. As we see it today, there is no limit to fund size. It's not even close to what the limited partner private equity community in general can provide. It is so far outpacing the capital being allocated to the sector. When once again you have a company at a billion dollars growing 20% a year without the benefit of added acquisitions and many of these companies are highly inquisitive. When you add to that the importance of buying some of the players that have the best technology in the space, this is just really only getting started. It's going to be a challenge for the whole investment community around this to adjust to this new world. Patrick: If we think about the potential source of return for you and your LPs through history, and then perspectively, maybe one convenient way to break that down would be like operational improvement, multiple expansion, or hopefully not contraction and leverage as a source of equity return, as well, how do you think that's changing? Like you mentioned, it's funny thinking about Prophet 21 for two times revenue. That's changed a lot, so multiples have expanded a lot and that's been one source of return for this style of investing. How do you think going forward, we should think about where return will come from across those three categories? Orlando: Let me take the easy ones first. Leverage has always been very little for us, because if you look at our first five years in software, 2000 to 2005, there was very little leverage in the industry. Maybe in 2004, it kind of got started. Credit Suisse was one of the first syndicated-type lenders in investment bank, but before that, you had to do almost like maintenance revenue loans with private banks. Wells Fargo was great at doing this at the time. The market was very, very tight and very small, and therefore there wasn't a lot of leverage back then. In hindsight groups like us earned it on operations and then multiplied expansion obviously happened. I don't think people were underwriting that, but it still happened. But in those times, 2000 to 2005, there was very little leverage in that component. Leverage came into the market, really, in 2005, but that was short-lived, because the financial crisis came in, in 2007. Then by the time we were sort of out of the financial crisis, 2011, really, by the time you can build your pipeline of deals and look at the market-leading companies, then the software-as-a-service transition was well on its way.Now, the targets that you're looking at are higher-growth SaaS companies that are becoming the business of their customers. We made that transition. We went to pursue at a higher valuation world, the higher-quality, faster-growth company. Instead of looking at values and reminiscing on what we were talking about, the two times maintenance revenue, one times revenue and saying, ""That's no longer here. We're really sad about it. What one or two deals can we find that are ""cheap"" relative to the market,"" we looked at that in a positive way and said, ""Wait a minute, our first 10 years in software, because it was an on-premise industry, you could only buy, really, solutions that are back office-oriented, that are automating paper-based processes. Important things, but nowhere close to buying SaaS businesses on the front end of their customers and that are really becoming their entire business. Of course, you have to pay higher multiples for that, but with that comes completely different growth and time and value proposition. Then on those, the multiples are high, and therefore the leverage component is not nearly the majority of your capital structure. Patrick: If you think about this perspectively, how do you think about then if we set leverage aside, operational improvement and operational fundamental growth versus multiple expansion from here? Like when you're underwriting a deal, are you assuming that the multiple will sort of stay the same? Obviously, that hasn't been the case historically, but things have come down a lot in public markets, as we're talking today, but some multiples are still crazy, crazy high for software businesses. How do you think about the mix and what can be relied on going forward? I guess what I'm really asking is like, how good is the opportunity for returns in this kind of investing today? Orlando: We have never subscribed to the view based on what we all come from, of buying high and selling higher. A lot of us are the product of the dot-com bubble burst. We lived through that, and in that environment, even when you had in your portfolio software or not, you had to go do quite a bit of operating work. We almost have, still, PTSD over that environment. Every time we make a decision, we still think, ""Does that look anything like that?"" Our partners talk us down. They're like, ""No, it has nothing to do with that. That was 33 years ago. It was just a coincidence. This is a completely different business."" But that's the conservative nature and culture that we have, which by the way, sometimes has limited us to pursuing yet other things. One of the biggest mistakes we've made is not doing more deals. There's not unlimited capital, so we're with what we've done in the past. In terms of multiple expansion, it depends how you look at it. You can say that groups like us, even model multiple contraction, because the EBITDA and the earnings and the operating income isn't there today. It may look as if you're paying a pretty wacky price based on the earnings today, so we don't necessarily look at our entry that way and match it up with a certain X, because we're really thinking about revenue multiples and then creating an engine or the profitability then comes in and makes it a fundamentally sound investment based on earnings, not just on revenue and the revenue growth.In terms of how attractive the opportunity is, I can talk in general about that. I can't talk about our specific model for that. The public market opportunity in enterprise software is so good today. These assets at the current valuations on average present a compelling investment opportunity. One way to look at it is, currently the Standard and Poor's 500 is trading at around 23, 20 PE, and the S&P grows earnings at 7% a year. If you buy the index, based on that growth, you own it at about a 16 PE at four years, the profitable software index, that's the thing, is the profitable, which you do have a large enough number of companies to call that an index. It's not like there's just seven or eight. But when you look at that profitable index, it's growing earnings at 20% and it's trading for a PE of 32, 35. It just depends. Maybe it's at 30. If you buy that without counting the superior business model of software, where you produce a lot more cash flow than with that, and all those dynamics, you will own that also at a 16 PE in four years. What would you rather own? These recurring revenue, almost a hundred percent recurring revenue companies with much better terminal growth rates that have sometimes the ability to really break out in terms of their performance, or the S&P 500? My answer is pretty clear.",1853
276,Orlando Bravo - The Art of Software Buyouts,Selling Well & The Art of Dealmaking," Patrick: One of the other really interesting features of your history is the speed sometimes with which you sell. There're some great examples here of very short-hold periods. I love the idea of exploring why and when to sell an asset, almost all the attention goes on why and when to buy something. Obviously, we've talked about the features of market leader and the changes in dynamics of multiples and all those great things, the stickiness of these and importance of these businesses to their customers, but no one talks about when to sell. You had some really interesting ideas here and your history has been, I think, kind distinct in the short holding periods. Talk us through what you've learned about selling well. Orlando: Traditionally, we have not been afraid to sell. That has been how we, philosophically, think about exits. That's a very important point, because I do see a lot of people in our great community really being nervous about that. How would that make them look? Is this the right time? What ifs? You can get quite paralyzed on that. There is nothing wrong with putting up a good return, leaving the company in great hands, whether it's private equity or strategic, and having them make a lot of money out of it. As a matter of fact, we feel that for the private equity community, so that's the most visible way of tracking our assets, that when they get sold to a strategic. The companies that we've sold, we're very, very proud that they've done really well for other funds. The way we say it is that means they want to work with us more, and we have a similarly limited partner community in all of these vehicles, so that's a good thing. We have a strategic buyer that has bought three companies from us, and I'm sure that they bought the second one because they liked the first one and so on and so forth. That means we have a good relationship there of selling. See, but that's what happens when you work with existing management, and you put really good processes in place and that existing management is not mercenary. They belong in that business. They have a mission about what they're doing. They stay, they continue to do well, and that gives you a longer road for wherever that asset ends up at. The words that we use on selling is, you should lean on selling when a strategic buyer approaches, because if they're here today, it's likely that they won't be here tomorrow, because they'll either buy something else, they'll either build the product organically, or next year they will change their set of strategic initiatives. Patrick: I love that concept of the strategic approaching you as a sign to sell. What a clean, simple heuristic. How does that play out in holding periods? How short can these holding periods be? If they're less than a year or two years or something like that, I think there's been examples like that, how different are other companies really from when you bought them to when you sold them? Given that they're already big and it's hard to change things, how much difference can you affect in a company in that short period of time? Orlando: You sound like one of our investors here when they do due diligence. I like this, so I'm used to this one. That is the whole byproduct of working with existing management. When you work with existing management, you can develop your business plan with them way before you close that deal. Sometimes you got to work on it before you close the deal in case there's a big lag between signing and closing. Therefore, in the software companies that are people-based, that move very quickly, you can make changes very quickly. Now, if you come at it with your approach that existing management has made too many mistakes, if people make that judgment, then whatever you put on paper on your model, you have to look at again, because did you really model the disruption of changing leadership, the time that it takes to get new leadership, the time that it takes that new leadership to learn the business before they can take action, because some managers like to spend some time really understanding what is going on before they have a point of view, and you could be two years into it before doing that. We feel that our approach is very difficult to do, because you do have to inspire people to think differently. That requires a lot of trust, a lot of patience. It requires knowing that people move at different speeds of getting some things and not getting others. It's a journey that we love, but it does allow you to run efficiently quite quickly, and therefore you're open to the changes that happen in the strategic buyer market. Patrick: What do you think would be the most surprising things about what you've learned about dealmaking to those that have never done it before? Orlando: On the one hand, it's really not that hard. If you really look at the big picture, if you have a great idea of something that is very compelling to you, that you understand deeply, pick up the phone, call the counterparty. People are a lot more open than you would think. Just go for it. Of course, you're going to have to raise the capital, but if it's a good idea, you'll be able to raise the capital. It's going back to one comment that you and I have spoken about is, right place at the right time. It's hard to go wrong in the U.S. economy in private equity in software. I mean, that's all a phenomenal combination. Now on the flip side of it, when you look at each tactical detail during the deal process, that could seem difficult, and you just have to live the journey many different times. There're so many small decisions to be made that lead you different ways on that deal, that the more active you are in doing that and the more experience you get, the more obvious it would go to. Patrick: Even with your great experience, I have not been through this nearly as many times as you, but it's just shocking in the few times I have, the amount of details that come up and how hard they can be to get through. I suspect that having done so many deals, there're still difficulties. What remains difficult each deal or most deals for you, despite your huge experience? Orlando: See, the key is separating the things that really don't matter from the ones that really, really matter because you're right. There're a lot of details. How crazy can you go over each one of them? The division missed the month in this area that call with that division did not go as well. Do you really have management buy-in? Also, some of these things you don't really know until you close the deal and you working together. I still think that the most difficult thing is that you have to earn it every single time. It doesn't matter what your past history is almost, in however many years, however many deals. What matters to your potential management partner and to that board is now. They appreciate the past and what. I'm not saying they don't, and that's very nice of them to do, but what matters is what you do now and earning it each time is hard. That's why my other answer is, if you haven't done it, try it, because it's just as hard for somebody to convince the counterparty and just work with them that has done it 500 times than for somebody that's doing for the first time. Sometimes doing it for the first time is an advantage, because you may not come with certain judgements or experiences that may allow you to be more open. By the way, that deal that you're doing is the most important deal of your life, which they may appreciate, as well. Patrick: What part of the process do you still enjoy the most? What stage or what part of this do you wake up with the most energy and excitement? Orlando: There are two and those are easy. One is, I love the competitive dynamics of the deal, absolutely love it. I learn a lot from our peers. I love the game. I really, really do. I joke with my colleagues that when the deal activity is low, I'm all depressed and do useless things. I just absolutely love that creative element of it. One of the things that I love about the deals is doing the right things, sticking to your word, being open with people on very stressful situations, because these companies sometimes have never gone through a transformational event that is this big. The second thing, and this takes longer, that I really love about our business is making those promises to existing management about how we're going to behave, what we're going to do together, and seeing them tell us two to three years after the fact, reminding us of those meeting and saying, ""You know what? You never changed your mind. This has exceeded our expectations. It really worked. This was the best time we've had."" We've had those comments before and that means the world to us, and I really enjoy that personally.",1970
277,Orlando Bravo - The Art of Software Buyouts,Leadership & Nurturing Talent," Patrick: You have this fantastic phrase, I just love it, that if your job title has a C in it, you're not allowed to complain. Say a bit about that idea, and then I'd love to explore any other similar ideas that you have about leadership or running companies well. Orlando: I appreciate you noticing that. I didn't mean that for CEOs of our companies who have a great relationship with us and so does our team. It's just in general, the C level title has proliferated. I remember it got started during the first dot-com movement where you have the chief development officer, and these are big jobs and they deserve that title, but when you get it, you have so much responsibility for other people and there can be so much drama in our organization, so much internal competition that becomes unhealthy, people that care deeply about their jobs and are equally competitive that need your help in parsing out what matters from what doesn't matter. Your role is not to increase that level of drama and potentially useless conversations and not value-creating anxiety. I'm not saying you're positive just to be positive, but a big part of your role is telling people, ""You know what? That's okay. Go make a mistake. It's okay."" Or if one of your colleague's hurt, go help them. We can fix this. Just let me know as far in advance as you can, and we can do this together, because for all those things that you can ""complain"" about, you can actually find a positive and say, ""Ah, this happened. Why don't we try this?"" Out of it comes something so much better, and that creative, positive approach, especially with young people now that are so talented, but have so many ideas, that positive, collaborative, creative approach can do so much. Patrick: Are there other deeply-held beliefs like that one about operating excellence that pop to mind from your experience working with so many operators? Orlando: Really good leaders delegate quite a bit of authority and responsibility. They have the experience to know when to get involved, to help, and when to not. They make things a lot more simple. We have a lot of experience and we continue to learn a lot about leadership, management, operating management, C-level executives that think about how every decision that they make impacts the P&L. That's big. There's not a lot of them in the world that really think that rigorously the P&L impact of every one of their decisions. Also, a leader can be both strategic and growth-oriented, as well as detailed and operationally-oriented. You see it, and when you see that, you just should establish the closest partnership you can, because it doesn't happen too often. Patrick: What does the word, service, mean to you as it relates to all of this that we've been talking about? Orlando: I just feel that the best guide as you pursue your journey in the world, as an individual, as a business leader, as a philanthropist, what are you about? What is your mission and therefore, what is your company's mission that you're involved in? What is your foundation's mission that you're involved in? The more you can understand what you're passionate about and have an opinion on, the more those worlds converge and become the same. They're more clear, your path is, on what you spend your time on, on how you make decisions, and on why is it that you're driven to help others, in what way. I can tell you, for me, my mission is to provide opportunities to talented people, especially young adults, that otherwise wouldn't have that chance. When we look to buy a company and the company has issues, because many times in private equity, something has happened. The company misses numbers. They missed a product cycle. Something made them more open to an ownership change, especially in the public markets.Well, we work with existing management. Now, these are the most talented people in the world, but I do feel that we're giving them a big opportunity to do things differently, create well, and do it in a way that is collaborative and good for their own organization. We adapt ourselves to their culture. That is very meaningful to us.If I look at the work that we did when we started our foundation, the Bravo Family Foundation in Hurricane Maria, the way we did relief, because we had no experience in doing hurricane relief efforts, but we used the same philosophy. We went directly to community leaders that run those communities, that know their people, that live in it, that know the problems and have the following of those disadvantaged communities, and we backed them. What do you need? You drive it. We'll back you. Now, we'll help you in terms of measuring results and supply chain issues and everything else that they had going on. When I think about the overall different areas of the foundation, we have this wonderful rising entrepreneurs program where we look to give these young, talented entrepreneurs in Puerto Rico capital, access to VCs in the U.S., access to our CEOs, one-on-one mentorship, a program of how to build and run a business that we build. That is, we are backing people at the source, and hopefully, giving them an opportunity that they otherwise wouldn't have. Patrick: I really love the mission of representing a sort of on-ramp, if you will, for talent, that doesn't come from the entrenched systems. I wonder, as you think about business growing accepted truth, that talent is now the constraining factor. Capital no longer is. Maybe back when you did the Prophet 21 deal, capital was a constraining factor, but now there's plenty of capital. Today, what we need more of is talent. How do we do a better job of on-ramping the kind of talent that you're focused on bringing into the system. It seems like there's a lot of room for improvement there. Orlando: Big time. One of the great openings that we all have is when different investment groups... I'm just talking about finance now, and it's beginning to happen in tech... but when different investment groups said, ""What are we really doing about being more inclusive and about hiring different people and more diversity and mentoring women for leadership positions in private equity and investing, running these companies?"" That whole memo that our community got, I don't know, seven years ago is actually now also opening up a world of where do you get this talent from? We have now so many great case studies, that as we move people up through our organization that have different backgrounds, many of them did not come from Harvard or the place where everybody looked to recruit. Once again, that's an incredible institution. It's nothing against that, but talent is everywhere now, and our community, our industry, we're lucky to be a lot more open to different places, therefore people, therefore, that did not go to the schools that we went to and that, therefore, are not like us. One young person at Thoma Bravo told me this years ago, which I always used, and I thought it was so insightful. She said, ""Don't think about culture fit. Think about culture add."" The way we think about it is, why have we been lucky? Of course, right place at the right time has lot to do with it. But also, our culture has a lot to do. It's not our metrics and our processes. Other people have that. It's how we come together as a culture to make decisions. What does that culture stand for? It stands for being open-minded, being collaborative, thinking differently. Is that culture, therefore, consistent with having a homogeneous group? Absolutely not. We have to move it forward. Patrick: What an awesome idea. Culture add, not culture fit. I mean, it's like an elegant... That person's very smart. That's a really, really interesting distillation of the concept. It's also kind of a good excuse to talk about this notion of decentralization. You mentioned this in leadership, too, that the best leaders run pretty decentralized, push power and authority down onto the experts versus being a micromanager. I think you think this coming decade's going to be defined by decentralization. I'd love to hear all the ways in which you think that that is true. It's a big buzzword, obviously, but an important one. How do you think that will define the 2020s and beyond? Orlando: Let me go back to operations. When you have these organizations that run in a very centralized way, I feel that these leaders are tricking themselves into thinking that success was due to them. It's actually success in spite of that, because when everything needs to flow to the top, it just takes too long to make decisions. You're too far removed from the day-to-day operational realities to be able to really make good decisions. You can empower people as a leader, you can instill your philosophy, your values and mission, but by doing that and letting them be their own artists and making their own right or wrong decisions that are closest to the action, you're going to just do so much better organizationally. Then, if we were doing an organizational behavior in business school, I would really, really argue for organizing yourself in that way, and we have done that. At Thoma Bravo, we work with CEOs on this similar philosophy. When therefore you extrapolate this to the world of technology and you think about Web 3, which stands for, really, the exchange of ideas around the world, regardless of national barriers, cultures, places, you name it. You have, ideally, an interconnected network of ideas where everyone that has a passion for something that's similar or similar subject or similar something, they're contributing to that community in an open way to find better ways, faster ways, more equal ways. That is being inputted in this sort of centralized system or database that is an interconnected, decentralized process of collaborating. That is just incredible. That's one of the reasons why I'm a big believer in the tokens and currencies that support this system, because they're the collateral for the system. They're the ways of measuring the value of each of those communities and systems, and they're as real as any currency created by an old set of rules and financial system. Patrick: We were talking earlier this week about some of the security and these protocols and their potential. I remember when I first got interested in, say, Bitcoin, it was the security angle that was really interesting to me, the encryption algorithm, the cryptography. Given that you spent so much time in this world of security and cybersecurity, how do you think all of this affects that world in the coming decade? What is most interesting to you about the technology of Web 3? You've just outlined sort of the ethos of Web 3, but what about the technology side? What pattern matching do you see given your unique experience with technology and, specifically, security companies? Orlando: I'm more interested in the social movement that it represents, actually, about that empowerment, because it's also a movement that allows so many people that have not participated in our financial world or our economic system to actually participate in it fully, and potentially win, and potentially do better because of that openness and that constant exchange of ideas. I do feel that blockchain could present better use cases than database software in a number of areas, and in the enterprise that is so early, I'm constantly looking for use cases that could replace SaaS and database software as we know it. There're some, but not that many, because that world is more focused on creating financial system and on the consumer, as well. But there are some now on the security side and you probably have a lot to say about this. There are some phenomenal CSOs and security experts that really are extremely worried about it. We're trying to figure that out from our own investments in SaaS software, cybersecurity and SaaS software. We're really trying to figure that out. Patrick: Going back to the world of private equity and investing, where we opened our conversation was all around this unique evolution of size and scope of these businesses. What, if anything, do you think is broken about the private equity model? Where does there need to be innovation? We've talked about middle market innovation, continuation funds, things like this, weird price distortions versus what public price might be on a business. Just give me a sense of maybe what needs innovation or might be a little bit broken in the private equity world and structure specifically. Orlando: All of those that you mentioned, some good ones, continuation funds, long-dated funds. The world's colliding between venture hedge funds, private equity SPACs. All these are ways that the financial community has been looking to innovate in order to match or try to keep up with the innovations that are going on in software and tech. Isn't that interesting that it all kind of happened together at the same time? Because we're all trying to pursue, how do we finance and get involved and participate in these companies? It can't be in the old way only. You would not be able to address the opportunity and improve upon the challenges that were therefore being served up to look at investors that's out there. I would love to see one huge innovation across what I call the original sources of capital, sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, even endowments, and that is to start looking first and foremost as software as not an industry anymore. So, not looking to measure how much ""exposure"" you have to it, because it is the entire business of companies.For example, if you look at verticals, you'll have companies that focus on manufacturing, retail, hospitality, real estate, like we have RealPage, and they have nothing to do with one another, except they're called software. They're more and more running the entire business of those segments. I think that's coming, but even a bigger one is to have these pools of capital, not differentiate private equity from their venture allocation, from their infrastructure allocation, to others and create almost these barriers to where capital should flow. Why doesn't an investor group look at a given big segment and say, ""I'm going to look at software, and in that segment, I am agnostic as to whether I'm going to invest directly in the public markets with a manager in the public markets, in private equity, in growth, in ventures."" What is the best way to deploy capital in that ecosystem? That will open up the free market and capital flows into their most efficient ownership structure and their most efficient use. Patrick: I normally wouldn't ask this question, but your specific interest in young talent, even though it's a cliched question, I think you're the right person to ask. What advice would you have for those young, talented people early in their careers about building a great career? What does a great career or the great careers that you've seen unfold, what do those share in common that could serve as advice for young people that are ambitious and want to get going? Orlando: I'm such a big fan of young people, because every graduating class, my experience in working with them as they come up through our associate ranks, is every younger class is better than the predecessor. They're more knowledgeable. They're deeper thinkers. They care more about the social impact of their actions. They're more philanthropic. They're more mission-driven. They're more complex. But my first big piece of advice is, the world is waiting for you with open arms. You can do anything you want. Now, of course, you're going to have to work hard at it. You're going to have to learn through making mistakes. You're going to have to listen carefully to mentors, see what mentors fit you better, but it's all open. Private equity, for example, if you think it's mature, it's just getting started. People thought that when I was interviewing in 1998, out of Stanford Business School in Stanford. I got those comments from some great leaders in private equity there, ""It's kind of mature. It's hard to get in."" No way, where the industry is now, and the same applies for whatever your passion or your interests are. A certain amount of confidence in a humble way is very important. You will accomplish what you want.The second thing is, do what you want to do now. Don't do something in order to do something else later. Some young people ask me, ""Well, do you think working at a company is a good way for me to get into venture capital or private equity?"" I say, ""Look, if you feel that right now you really want to work in operations at a company, go do it. Go crush it, but don't do it to do something else. If you're really interested in venture, go work in venture."" You will develop your own set of weapons in that environment and your own skillset to make you different. Then the third one is, keep your ears open, your heart open, your mind open, because there are mentors all around you that legitimately want to help you. Who do you decide to listen to, because they all want to help? Individuals have that in us. Patrick: It's a great excuse to ask my favorite and traditional closing question that I ask everybody. What is the kindest thing that anyone's ever done for you? Orlando: Oh my gosh, there are just so many. I don't know how far back to look at it. That friend at Brown, when I was ready to go to law school to really grab me, take me to buy some wing-tipped shoes, because that's the way you were supposed to dress and put my name to be interviewed by Morgan Stanley on the door at 2:00 PM. I got that job and it pushed me into a different career and probably into what I'm doing now. I had this great mentor from Puerto Rico who unfortunately passed away years ago, who worked so hard with me to leave New York to go to Silicon Valley in 1994, because that's where he saw a big opportunity for me. I go back to all these career things that people did for me that have helped me along. Patrick: Wonderful stuff. Orlando, this has been a total pleasure for me, a totally unique perspective that you bring to bear. Even though I've done a lot of these with great investors, your style of investing is different from any that I've done before. So appreciate the insights that have resulted from such a neat career. I thank you so much for your time. Orlando: Thank you so much, Patrick. I really have enjoyed this.This site uses cookies to improve your browsing experience.

278,Nick Saltarelli - One Foot in Front of the Other,Introduction," Patrick: My guest today is Nick Saltarelli, co-founder of the functional chocolate bar business, Mid-Day Squares. Nick started the company with his wife and brother-in-law a few years ago to build on a simple idea. If big chocolate bar brands were to start today, what would they look like? In our conversation, we discussed the importance of Mid-Day Squares hundred million dollar revenue target, what's wrong with the CPG industry today and how to keep a long-term mindset while making the most of every day. Please enjoy this unique conversation with Nick Saltarelli.",135
279,Nick Saltarelli - One Foot in Front of the Other,Mid-Day Squares & The Motivations Behind It," Patrick: So Nick, we met yesterday. I meet so many interesting people just chatting about your business over Twitter. Maybe just begin by telling us what Mid-Day Squares is. Like literally, what is the product and how did you think to start the business? Nick: Yeah, so I like to say a lot of people like to put us in the bar category, but we're really trying to reinvent what a chocolate bar is. So Mid-Day Squares, we call it a functional chocolate bar. The number one question I always get asked is, well, what's a functional chocolate bar? It's meant to give you a little bit more than just that sweetness and that kick. So the whole bar was designed to curb cravings, give you hunger coverage until your next meal. We called it Mid-Day Squares because you're supposed to be hitting it in the afternoon. But more importantly than anything, the hypothesis of the company has been simple if Hershey's, Nestle, Mars started today, what would those companies look like? In our opinion, they definitely wouldn't be bringing to market the chocolate bars that you know them so well for. My wife came up with the recipe fridge. She was making the product for a while. It was not obvious at all that this was going to be a business. And then what made it the business was I got a piece of data. I can't name it publicly, but from someone in M and A. I love reports. Any type of reports, I love reading them. And I was just reading it. And what was so fascinating, I heard through so much reading that plant-based proteins were on a tear, but the real chocolate report was really interesting.And so real chocolate is chocolate that can't use palm kernel oil, has to be above 50% in cocoa mass and can only use a regular sugar. So no sugar alcohols, none of that stuff. The report from 2009 to 2017, this type of chocolate was just seeing unprecedented numbers. And it was led by companies like Lindt, Hu Chocolate. And what was so fascinating to me when I was reading the report was everybody that was in the real chocolate category. And I think this is why largely big titans in the industry missed it per se, is if you went to go look at the plant-based category, it looked like chocolate bars had existed. But all of the bars in the plant-based category that had function and used chocolate were not using real chocolate. They were using chocolate couverture, which is palm kernel oil based chocolate. And it's really shitty. It's like a thin little one millimeter chocolate experience . On the real chocolate report, what was fascinating is every single bar that was there was rectangular in nature and really thick. And that's where that moment was. And Les, who's now my wife, was my wife at the time was making this product for me. We were roommates and it was just like, this is the thing that we got to bring to market. And that 2017, we went, we went and made that product happen because I felt that there was just a huge opportunity in chocolate. Patrick: We certainly will talk a lot about market selection and some of the things we were chatting about yesterday. But maybe begin by telling us why you're so publicly open about what you're doing. The reason I found you was I saw something about you're on a quest to build a hundred million dollar revenue business. You're about a 10th of the way there, which is no small feet in a product category like this just a couple years in. What's your motivation? You seem to have a unique set of motivations for doing this, whether or not it was chocolate or something else. Nick: My whole life, man, I've been misunderstood. I think my other two partners have been understood a lot too. I've always been a massive dreamer at every single point in time. One of those things were put down by people. And so I think why I'm so public about it is that I really believe people need to stop having these constraints on what they can do and why they can do it. I've been speaking about trying to build a business like Mid-Day Squares for as long as I could remember. And it was always like, that's just not obtainable for you. That's not possible. And then when I grew up though, I had this really unique experience of being able to see something. And you know this is where privilege comes into play, I think. My dad was an immigrant from Italy. He came over at the same time as this other family, roughly, called the Saputos. And he became very close with one of these gentlemen and I had the good fortune of, my dad passed away when I was 10. But up until then, I would go every Saturday we would go for haircuts and I would get to be a fly on the wall of listen to these two gentlemen speak. And I saw literally a business go from, Saputo family started a cheese manufacturing plant in their garage in Montreal. And they're today, the second largest dairy conglomerate in the world. They trade, they have about a 13.5 billion market cap, and I kind witnessed this all unfold. And this is where people chastise me a lot when I say like, it seemed simple. It seemed like it was a simple thing with a lot of hard work, a lot of grit, a lot of that, but it didn't seem unobtainable to build a massive company like that. And I just had this bug that I was like hooked on that.Especially, when you're under 10, you don't really know exactly what that bug is, but you know that you're really excited about things and that kind of spun a journey of life that took me in so many different directions to finally getting to Mid-Day Squares. And when we got to Mid-Day Squares, I think why we're doing it publicly is you don't realize how many good people there are in the world. And my brother-in-law, who's my partner, Jake really introduced me to the idea of, I guess we call it on Twitter building in public, but I don't like per se the word building in public. Just really sharing everything you're going through and ambition. When you share ambition... So why that hundred million dollar marker is there? I like to say it's not because it's some dream. It's actually a concrete game plan that we have, a concrete market size and it keeps us accountable. It keeps me accountable by continuously saying where we're at on the journey, how we're getting there. And so there's accountability built into it but two, it brings on a tremendous amount of people that want to help. And Mid-Day Squares has literally gotten into every retailer because of people I've met on Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, you name it. But then finally, the most important piece on that whole thing is that building something and saying those things makes people feel uncomfortable around you. And my goal in life is to show that you could just do it. And we've been videotaping everything from the beginning. We possess nothing special as individuals, us three as founders that suggest that we have a better shot and making a hundred million come over the next person. And it's worked tremendously along the way. I can't tell you how many messages we get of people like, okay, this motivated me to do this or this motivated me to do that. Because at the end of the day, we have nothing special. There's really only two things that we have hard work, determination, and the ability to tell great stories and connect with an audience. If you have those two things, I think you can literally go as far as you want in the world or not. Patrick: Going back to the experience, watching the cheese business scale. I'd be really curious to hear what major lessons you took away or continue to take away from your relationship with that business. And also just what that hard formative time was. You mentioned your dad passed away when you were 10, how that changed your trajectory and impacts all of this? Those two early formative experiences would be interesting to go a little bit deeper on. Nick: Lino Saputo Senior was always relentless and all the conversations I would hear him have with my dad, it was always extreme focus. I can't explain it, there was this like relentless focus of every year if you put a few bricks in front of the next break, you built an incredible house. And so when they were, let's call it a non-public company, they were this really large family business. And when they were this really large family business, I think they had a lot of things going for them and a lot of things not going for them. And Lino was always super in touch with what wasn't going for them. And for instance, I remember him early on in '94 or '95, talking about taking the company public. You have to understand this is a non-high school graduated human being, who's an immigrant from Italy, who never had any business doing anything in the public markets. And I remember just that, I'm making this happen and this is what's happening. And all he started to do was surround himself with the right people. And I even remember he took my dad, they were doing a course on public markets and he took my dad to one of the courses with him. Like a general course . You know what I'm trying to say? Like... Patrick: Not Goldman Sachs, of course, a seminar. Nick: Of course. Yeah. Literally a seminar that was being hosted, I think by one of the banks. And everything he said he did. And my takeaway from watching that happen was, oh, this gentleman makes everything he says happen in a really basic way by just putting one foot in front of the other. Two, everybody around them would always say, I remember when he did the big cleanup. So he reorganized the entire business from a family business to get ready to be this massive growth trajectory. Oh, they can't do it, they have no business growing outside of the Quebec market, not even out of Canada. Then they went and they bought a company that was bigger than them. And they were scrutinized for that. And everybody just kept on throwing rocks at them. But here he just kept on putting one foot in front of the other. I think he's like the third richest person in Canada. He's always on those lists. Now that is not part of the reason of why I look up to them. Why I look up to them is they made really unachievable tasks seem so simple. And I think the smartest people in the world do that a lot because it's not complicated. It's literally one foot in front of the other, long-term vision. I'd really love to speak about long-term vision at some point versus short term vision. Because I think my generation's play with short term thinking and that long-term vision, there was one thing he always said in every decision he made, Lino Saputo Senior was, ""We're building the biggest chief company in the world. This is a legacy business and I hope it's going to be here after I die.' Every decision he made was always optimized for that. I don't think it's luck or even a mistake that they're the second biggest cheese conglomerate in the world.Or dairy conglomerate, not even cheese anymore, just cheese. My dad was a huge piece. He's a great entrepreneur, my father. He was a food distributor. So I grew up in the food business. I literally lived in food warehouses or manufacturing plants. And as you know, my dad died when I was 10. And so I only got 10 years with him and people always ask that's so young or so short. Here's the thing I'll say on that subject matter that's really, really important. I look around at some of the people I know in my life that still have their parents in their lives and they don't have relationships with them or they have negative relationships. And so I think time is really irrelevant for how long we get to spend with humans. It's like what type of quality we have. And so the 10 years I got with my father were incredible. I spent every single Saturday with him in a deep way. He was a hard worker, so we didn't get much time in the week, but every single Saturday I would go and spend a full day with him. And the one thing I always loved about my dad is he treated me like an adult when I was a kid. He never spoke to me like a kid, ever. Even though I may have not been able to process the emotions of what he was going through or maybe I didn't have the intelligence yet, but he always spoke to me like he was speaking to somebody his age. Which really helped me, I feel develop earlier and just have a different view of the world. And then two was this larger than life figure of enjoying life. And that's why, for me, I think the way he died was really tragic.And I speak about this pretty openly because it really taught me moments in life. And I know it's cheesy. But he died, we were in a car together driving, didn't feel well, said he had to pull over and had a massive heart attack and died. And we were literally in a conversation while it happened. That experience of death and that you can experience death in so many different ways, but seeing it happen like in a regular moment, the way this conversation is happening, really warps your entire vision of like what time and space and energy actually means. Because from one moment to the next, it was over. There's some serious learning from his passing. One was that your plans in life don't mean anything. My dad had plans and even to the best that he tried to protect what would happen after he passed away, it all went to shit anyways. His partner was misgiving to us. I won't name his name, because I've made peace with that. But he put our family into a really stressful position. So plans don't mean as much as we do. And I think he spent probably too much energy on a life that he was going to live verus the life that he could have lived. And so, although we had an extreme amount of great times together, we didn't spend enough time together. That really has changed my life completely. I know today we call it work life balance. I don't know how I feel about that expression, but what I feel is presence. I've always felt extreme presence. I always feel this rush because he died at 42 years old. So people are always like, Nick, what are you in the rush for? Yeah, I'm not in a rush. I just know that I'm not promised tomorrow.So I act accordingly. Like I really, really do. And so I think the best thing you can do is act as if you're not going to live forever and plan is if you're going to live forever to the best of that balance. And I think a lot of people put too much value on future moments versus the current. After he died, I completely just changed. I was horrible at school before he passed away, I was horrible at sports and after he passed away, I excelled at everything. And I think that was largely because I realized that the only person going to get shit done for me is me. It was very lonely 10 to 20, even though I had a great family and a great mom. It was a very lonely time because everybody was suffering in silence. It was a tragic ending, but it changed my whole game. I mean, I went from being a kid to an adult quickly and realized that the only person that's going to pave the path is myself. I had a good fortune of having a father that taught me both through his learnings, but also what he didn't know he was going to teach me, which was dying and having to have all of life unfold after that. That was it, man. It made me who I am today.",3439
280,Nick Saltarelli - One Foot in Front of the Other,Long-term Thinking & Influential Mentors," Patrick: Can you scroll back a little bit with this? You touched on it the long term versus maybe the short term focus, our younger generation tends to have. I like the idea of the balance of planning as if you're going to live forever, but focusing and acting as if you're not. It's kind of a interesting, weird thing to hold in your head at the same time. What does it mean to have a long term plan to you and what does it allow for that wouldn't be allowed for, if you didn't have that plan? Like what does it unlock if you were coaching other entrepreneurs on using this tool to become more effective, how would you coach them? Nick: Let's take sports for example. I started off really, really bad and became really, really good. I remember again, there was a gentleman that came into my life, Rory Olson that we could speak about as well too, that saw potential in me. Took me under his wing. And the reason I want to say this to the audience is don't think that I came up with any of this stuff on my own. There was a lot of people coaching me through. And so Rory put me with one of the top sports psychologists, his name's Howard Schwartz. He's out of Montreal. He does all MLB pitchers. Howard really brought the idea of A, stopping to focus on where were we going to be specifically this season. He asked me what my goal was. I said, I want to make the NHL. So my goal is a point in the future that is very far. So we have to stop optimizing per se, for what's going to happen in September at training camp, because I might not get the results I want in six months. But if we keep chipping away today, we're going to get somewhere in a long time. And that pressure of saying, ""Hey, I may not be the best next season. But if we have a game plan and we stick to the game, plan, time will do its thing."" At a young age, that alleviates a lot of pressure from you.So when I was showing up every season and getting a little bit better, to my peers, maybe I wasn't succeeding. But to self I was succeeding in a major way, because I was one step closer to this far vision of the NHL. I remember as I was really starting to hit top tier, where I started going into the top five goalies in Canada, that's when people started to take notice. I remember somebody asked me one training camp when I came back one summer and I was really at the top of my game, what did you do this season? I said, ""Well, it's not what I did this season. We started this game plan five years ago."" It's not a last six month thing. So I think entrepreneurs think that when you read the headlines and the media and everything, that results always need to be within 12 months. That's true to a certain extent based on where you are in the trajectory and what the narrative is and how you're raising funds. But ultimately the longer the vision, the more you're going to optimize for things that your peers are most probably not optimizing for and decision making, that will allow you to actually have a competitive edge over the long term. That's where it's a mind for a lot of people, is that it's not instant gratification. So humans tend to avoid things that are not instant gratification. To bring it back to Mid-Day Squares, to make the correlation to how even it was similar to what we were doing in hockey.When we started this, the goal was to be build the next Hershey's. In order to do that, we needed a product that was 10x better than what was on the market. In order to do that, we most probably had to build a manufacturing plant, and we get into the reasons why we had to build that manufacturing plant. But nobody in the game was building manufacturing plants. All my peers in CPG, think we're mental for having taken that route. That route makes sense, because when you're building a plant, forget it. If you think you can build a manufacturing plant and get the profitability in under five years, you have a serious thing coming for you in terms of realization. Everybody was not wanting to make that decision. But for us, we weren't trying to get anywhere quickly in five years. So it didn't matter to invest in a manufacturing plant and take that really long term vision. I think in a decade from when we start, people will ask us, ""Wow, how did Mid-Day Squares get here?"" Well, I'll say exactly like in training camp, it didn't happen this summer. We made a decision six years ago. That's now only paying off. Patrick: I'd love to go to Rory Olson, who I think, as you said, took you under his wing and taught you a lot. I'm going to ask you what he taught you about a couple things. So what did he teach you about the art of deal making? Nick: Rory Olson is this incredible Montreal entrepreneur. He was the first person to start 56K modem, when the internet was pumping out in Canada. So he was the largest internet provider in the 90s, sold that company. Again, everything he did from nothing, poor as hell. Grew his way. Only started making success in his mid thirties. Largely, people would say he was unsuccessful up until then and just kept on staying in the pocket and getting involved in businesses. What Rory's skillset was, and I'll say even till this day, is he would get intertwined with big companies. At the time, it was Bell, BC in Canada and multiple of these different types of companies. These conglomerate had assets within them that they had no idea what to do with, a lot of the time. They would end up getting stuck in the belly of the beast. Let's call it. Roy was really good, picking them out, convincing the boards to spin them off to him or sell them the assets, and then turn those assets into really see accessible businesses. It started in the 90s, they were in selling long distance minutes. So he was with Bell. He was a reseller of long distance minutes. And then they had this little division that was growing pretty quickly, which was their internet division, but they didn't know what to do with it.So he bought out their entire division and they started what ended up becoming Canada's largest internet provider, and he sold that. Then after that, the world knows his biggest success. The world knows it today as Paysafe. They're the third largest payment wallet in the world. I'm pretty sure. So he founded Paysafe and it was out of Montreal. Again, went back to Bell. Bell, at this point in time had this division that they didn't know what to do with, which was a credit card processing division. It wasn't set up for the internet era, took the asset from them and became really, I would say the largest payment processor in 2000, 2001, 2002. Spun that company off, took it public. It was valued at two and a half billion when they took it public. He just kept in doing this.So at this point I had really come into his life when he was hitting it big. He had just took the company public. That time Paysafe was not called Paysafe. I forget the name of it. We'll get back to it. But he took that company public and removed himself from that. We were starting to get really, really close. I was friends with his daughter. I ended up dating his daughter. He only had three girls, never had a boy. So we became really, really tight. He just started taking me everywhere, literally everywhere. And then that led to one more monster company, which was Airborne Entertainment. I worked for each one of his companies up until from the age of 13 to 20, every single summer in real jobs with him. So for instance, Airborne Entertainment, I'll never forget. We were sitting on a couch one day, iPhone didn't even exist yet. All had flip phones and he's always looking for deals. He was always looking for businesses that needed some type of turning point to take off. So there was these two gentlemen that he knew in Montreal that had a deal for ring tones, music ring tones. They were doing some good capital with it. They were bringing some good revenue, but they didn't really know where to take it further after than that.We were sitting in the room one night and he saw all of us on our flip phones, text messaging. At that point he was like, ""Wow, this is going to be huge."" And they actually created the first app store. So they were before the app store on the iPhone, called Airborne Entertainment. I saw that company go from a startup with three people to a hundred million dollar exit in two and a half years, three years. Literally just bringing the team together, getting it done. To the point just to show you the relationship, is when we sold the company to the Japanese firm. Throughout the entire due diligence, Rory brought me to every single meeting and the due diligence process. Brought me to the first opening meeting with the Japanese firm. When we sold- Patrick: And you were a kid? Nick: I got to be 15 years old, at most. Patrick: Wow, cool. Nick: And when we sold the company, I was the first person in the room to hold a check. A lot of people said, ""There was a check."" Yep. There was actually a check that came through. It was 95 million in change. I just looked at this and I was just like, ""Wow, we did this in two and a half years."" Like, ""You did this in two and a half years."" That puts very, very insignificant part in it. And that just changes your perspective on everything. So Rory is a legend in Montreal, every entrepreneur here knows it from the biggest to the smallest. And this was the man that put me in the game. Patrick: All right. So now we can go back to specific lessons. I love the story. What did he teach you about the art of deal making? Nick: Every single deal is literally one phone call away. Even if you do not know at all, any person on the other side of the table. It's literally as simple as if you see value creation, it doesn't need to be more complicated, then the next step is to pick up the phone and get in touch with a person on the other side at all means. A lot of people will say, ""Well, that's easy because Rory had a network."" No, that's not true. He didn't have any network in a lot of the areas that he would end up selling the business to, or end up bringing investors in. It was the grind for him to find who he was going to put the deal together with, and bring the right people to the table to get it done. Two is, you do not have to conduct yourself as an asshole. And that one thing that he would constantly drill into my head, was even when he was dealing with sharks, people call him. I think sharks is this fancy word to tell people that are assholes, that they're sharks. They're not apples. They're sharks. Is that you don't yourself have to ever move an asshole in the world. If you treat people well, those deals will go further. Even if they don't go through, those deals will come through somewhere in the future.That is so true to the point where, I want to say, Mid-Day Square's first investment was from a person I met six years before Mid-Day Squares existed at a rooftop cocktail event for a startup. Even though we both knew, we were trying to get something done for years together, it never got anywhere. But that love that we always treated with each other came through. I remember when we did our first raise, everybody was like, ""Well, that was so easy. How did you pull that off?"" So no six years of relationship building in these things. And then lastly, I know I said too, is every bloated company has incredible assets. Every bloated company. Go fishing all the time. Till this day, he still goes fishing in there. He just bought over a company called VOTI. They do all high speed x-ray technology outside of airports. So their clients are Amazon, packages going through. So there's so many packages being moved. That there was this fledgling manufacturing operation in Montreal, that was trying to go after military operations. But he saw e-commerce exploding and that the need for high speed x-ray machines were going to continuously increase. So again, bought himself into a distressed asset and has really turned it around. I think they're pretty much almost one of the leaders, almost all Amazon centers use their product. But every bloated company has dead assets. Dead assets are just two moves away from being billion dollar businesses. Patrick: You alluded to a little bit maybe, about capital raising specifically. So you've had to raise investor capital a few times and I'm sure will in the future, given your capital intensive way of building this business. What lessons did he teach you there or have you learned there? Nick: So always be fundraising even when you don't have a business. No joke. Trevor from Alliance Consumer Capital. So he was the VC that funded barkTHINS. Had really huge success with it, has now created another firm called Aria VC. He could go on record and say this. I tried calling him and I tried messaging. I tried emailing him, in 2016 and said, ""Hey, I don't have an idea yet. I'm an entrepreneur. I really think that because of my background in technology and software engineering, bringing an outsider mentality into CPG, that we can have some success. I know I don't have an idea yet, but we should probably get to know each other."" And so I've been doing that for a long time of where I cold call venture capitalists when I don't have ideas, to build the relationships before fundraising actually starts. It's funny, because a lot of people will think you're absolutely out of your mind. Like Trevor had told me at the time, he didn't take it seriously.That's fine. I don't take it negatively when people say that, why would you take me seriously? I haven't proven to you why you should take me seriously yet. But with a hundred of those types of messages, two, three will get back to you and you start building this network, to build an incredible army of capital. So Rory was always doing that. Second was, do events and do them a lot. One thing don't network. Network on steroids. I mean that's one thing he would always do is network on steroids. What that means is, if you're showing up to a networking event and you're not on the speaking list or you're not putting it together, you're probably doing networking wrong. Now that doesn't mean that going to a networking event is bad. It just means you haven't elevated yet to how hard you could unlock networking. It means you're just going in the right direction. I remember I had no name in technology in Montreal, nobody. But I was really into TechCrunch in 2014 and all that. I was following all the editors. One of the editors, John Biggs ended up doing a Kickstarter for a children's book that he was writing. I ended up, for $500, I would get a dinner with him in Brooklyn. All I had to do was give 500 bucks to support his children's book, had nothing to do with anything. I bought that package. I ended up getting a dinner with John in Brooklyn, went there. This is again the opposite approach to everything, don't ask. Stop, give. Just be a steward of value and life will treat you well.Showed up to the dinner. Didn't ask for anything, just listened to John's story. Just kept on asking him like, ""Here's my skill sets. Here's where I can help you."" He was marketing his book. I was really good at that stuff. At the end of the dinner, he's like, ""It's so weird. You don't want anything."" I said, ""Man, I'm just pumped to be here."" He's like, ""Well, I got something for you."" TechCrunch had never been to Canada at that point. They do TechCrunch live events. He's like, ""Would you like to host TechCrunch in Canada for the first time?"" I'm like, ""What? You're going to trust me to do that?"" He's like, ""Yeah."" He's like, ""You seem like you can pull this off."" I'm like, ""Hell yeah."" So I get back to Montreal. All of a sudden, everybody starts answering my phone. I knew I didn't have the capacity to fill up an event, but I knew two guys in the scene that did have it. So I just started calling them. There was this guy LP, who owns busbud.com, which is the Expedia for buses. And he was huge in the scene, knew everybody and everybody. I'm like, ""LP, I got TechCrunch. They never been here. This is going to be a huge event. Could you help me put it together?"" We did so well in Montreal, TechCrunch gave us Toronto too.Just by being out there with good vibes, not really demanding anything in return, just really being a steward of adding value. I was able to really turbocharge my network quickly because when you host TechCrunch and you get to put your name with that and the people around it, everybody's like, ""Well, who the hell is this kid? Who is Nick?"" And that was my moment of building what ended up being this incredible community of entrepreneurs, VCs, which actually led to the investment in Mid-Day Squares. I say this story because there's no reason why I should have been the person to host TechCrunch. The only reason why I got that was simply by asking what could I do for people that I see online? How could I help them? And in return shit happens. And that was something again, what are mentors? Mentors aren't necessarily people that give you playbooks. I just watched Rory. We literally just had a conversation a week ago. I tried to tell them, ""Dude, just watching you operate, taught me how to operate."" In and of itself, was the advantage.",4028
281,Nick Saltarelli - One Foot in Front of the Other,"CPG, Manufacturing & Marketing"," Patrick: Let's get back to Mid-Day Squares now, which is, what I was so fascinated about was obviously the product is very good. I think I originally discovered it because I was just looking for stuff to snack on that wasn't too unhealthy during the day. Several people recommended it and I tried it. It was excellent. It got me fascinated with some of the strategic thinking around the category of CPG. Everything that's sexiest these days is pure technology. Here we are with a low SKU, high manufacturing, heavy and operationally intensive type business, very different. I'd love to hear your view on this idea we were talking about yesterday of low SKU count, global distribution. What's wrong with CPG and why such huge categories like chocolate, even though it seems obviously picked over can be huge opportunities? Nick: So I went to University of Iowa and I had this one teacher that really, really changed the entire thinking of everything for me. I think this is so important for the audience. Literally the beginning of the year, put on Y axis, X axis on the board and started plopping all these thoughts. It was computer science or physics class. I can't even remember. But it was one of those two that we did at University of Iowa. Basically he put all these dots on the graph and then he drew the median line through it. And then he circled the outlier on top, the outlier on the bottom. He said, ""I don't really give a what you guys take away from this semester. As long as you take away this one thing."" And this one thing could be applied to everything. This is the beauty of math is that, it is physically impossible to feed a data set with average inputs and have an average outcome. I know that sounds so simple, but it was like, ""Oh my God, that's so true."" If you give a data set average inputs, whether you know it or not, you revert to the average. If you need to have an on average outcome, you must by definition, make above average bets or below average bets, but be out of the average. It doesn't guarantee that you're going to have a positive success or a negative success, but it guarantees for sure that you will have an outlier outcome, if you really feed the data set with on average data inputs.So that change my entire process of thinking. Everything ... Literally, if you come to my condo on a whiteboard, it says, ""When you find yourself on the side of the majority, stop and reflect."" I was in software. Now the thing though is, I think you know this better than anything. In investing, the only way to beat it, you got to have contrarian bets at some point in the place. You have to be against the herd on thought and in some way, shape or form. For me, it was increasingly obvious that people were rushing into technology, and I think people were rushing into it because the business models made a lot of sense, but people a lot are forcing products, that's just my opinion, into what could we build in software? Not everything has this exponential growth, great SaaS products, there's great this, great that, but not everybody has the ability to go and take that. In my viewpoint, I had nothing there, but I kept on looking at what was happening in CPG, and I was like oh my God, there is really massive opportunity over there. So I started researching a little bit more and what you realize is that CPG, one, is not a winner-take-all market. And when we were doing more research in it, you start to realize that all of the founders that were coming into the CPG market were looking for easy wins. So I think the media created this warped vision of CPG that you could go to a manufacturer, put on a fancy label, and become a multimillionaire pretty quickly. And so all these people started to rush into it. Here's the fun thing though about this whole thing, and market cycles exist everywhere, by the way. You see it in public markets, cycles happen everywhere. So somewhere in the late '80s and '90s, divestitures started happening at big CPG amongst Procter & Gamble, people had this idea that they were now at critical scale, that they can offload their heavy CapEx assets, and their brand was good enough to say hey, we're going to be the marketing arm and we're going to allow other people to manufacture this product. And that set this entire new precedent for CPG to the point where investors started to actually shy away from any type of CPG founders that wanted to pursue manufacturing. Now, why is this piece important? This piece is important because if you go into a grocery store, if I give you any aisle, I blindfold you and we take five random products in a category, you will probably not be able to taste the difference between those five companies. And the reason is the consultation from the '90s to now has happened in a massive way that there's very few manufacturers at scale making product.So what's happened is that CPG companies and manufacturing companies are no longer aligned on product development. And so I would say R&D has completely just been shat on in CPG, founders coming into it usually have great ideas that are squashed, and they happen at Mid-Day Squares, by contract manufacturers. And the reason is a contract manufacturer is incentivized to basically make everything on their line as homogenous as possible. So let's say you're using wheat flour and I'm using regular flour, and the contract manufacturing is processing for you, and I come to them with my product, they pressure a lot of people into trying to change their ingredient decks. They'll say, ""Hey, why don't you use wheat? We're already carrying it in our distribution center. Why don't you do this? Why don't you do that?"" And what you notice quickly is they're trying to push you into the mold so that they can have the highest possible efficiency on their machines with the lowest possible turnover. Lots of founders, I believe, are scared of an opposite choice, which is not to go the co-packing route, and they end up succumbing to the pressures of contract manufacturers. And so you consistently have these products that are being turned out that taste the same. They literally use the same flavor houses, the same supply chain on raw materials. And so that, for me, was just like holy crap, the bar in CPG is so low that if we actually create a product that tastes delicious, I think we can do massive damage. So that was hypothesis number one. Hypothesis number two is let's not go into a super niche market. At this point, when I was doing a lot of reading on food, we launched this in 2017, I became super interested with my wife in developing a food company in 2015. We had no idea it was going to be Mid-Day Squares. And so when I was doing a lot of reading, I realized that a lot's changed. If you look at all the revenue from publicly traded CPG companies, this is where it becomes fascinating, 80% of revenue is usually derived from three core SKUs. And we're talking massive portfolios.Hershey's portfolio is so big, but yet 3.4 billion or 2.4 billion, don't quote me on that, comes from Reese. Only Reese. Right there, it's so obvious that you don't need large SKU count in order to make monster revenue. We started focusing on what are the areas of business in CPG that are huge, and ready-to-drink beverage is huge, snacking on the go is huge, and chocolate. This was crazy. When we started looking at the data on chocolate, I think it's up to 140 billion is traded annually, and I'm not even sure that calculates what's happening outside of Europe and North America. It's the fastest growing snacking item in emerging countries like China, China just surpassed the US in per capita consumption of chocolate. It requires no education. Almost anywhere you are in the world, if you give somebody chocolate, they know exactly what you're doing. It's a form of endearment, it's a form of happiness, it's a form of you just know, you don't even need to speak the language. It is monster. And that was like hey, all our peer founders or even big companies are so focused on this monster diversification, that if we stay really, really core and focus on global distribution, we could probably build a really monster company. That's contrarian. I know you're probably sitting here and being like that makes a lot of sense, but we are scrutinized for that all the time amongst investors and the industry, but literally the number one algorithm that we use in decision making at Mid-Day Squares, every single person uses it here, is what do we believe the herd would decide on in a decision we are going to make? And let's explore a completely opposite decision to the herd. That doesn't mean that every single decision you make has to be contrarian, it means you should probably take a pretty good fucking look at every decision and ask yourself are we making this decision because this is what people are telling us or because we've derived this decision from our own data? And that, I think, has been something that's been very powerful for us at Mid-Day Squares and the decisions we've made. Patrick: Yeah, I get the point on manufacturing, where to have a better product, you need to control it so you don't get jammed in this weird perverted incentive system of global co-packers, but give me another of how you made a different decision. And it could be one that worked out or didn't. Like you said, you want to be non-average, that doesn't always mean right. Nick: Yeah, exactly. Patrick: A key point. But yeah, give me another example of doing something just totally differently than would be typically in the playbook. Nick: Going into the fridge was something that everybody was telling us you cannot build a big business in the fridge. How are you going to build a big business having a refrigerated supply chain? That question kept on coming up and when you speak with investors or people in the industry, the answer is not ever an educated answer. That's always a telling sign for me when it's time to scratch really deep, it's, ""Oh, refrigerated is very hard."" What the hell does that mean? What does that mean? Why is that bad just because it's hard? And so when we were looking at it, there was two things here that was really interesting to go into the fridge was one, A, we believe that you can actually develop a product that tastes incredible in the fridge because you don't have to optimize for two year shelf lives that I think are going away. And B, it allowed us to stay away from Hershey's Mars contracts in every other store. So when we were going into the stores, especially early on, we were never competing with them, and we still don't to this day, on shelf space because they're in the shelf stable section, and they usually have contracts in those areas. Number two, produce has been around for as long as we can exist. Produce has six days shelf lives. Six days. We have 100 day shelf life. I think going into the fridge was a huge contrarian move at the time and the reason why it was exciting, I'll give her shout out, [Miyoko] is a woman that has been helping us, she worked at Mars for a long time, and Miyoko told us, ""I really believe in what you guys are doing and I can assure you that if you go after the big guys playing their game, you will get destroyed. They understand two year shelf stable better than you will ever understand it. But if you invite them onto your territory to play your game, you really have a shot at beating them because they actually have no idea how to handle short shelf life.""It goes back to this ideology of where you start to say okay, what are they doing? What could we do that's opposite and give us a competitive advantage. That was one of those decisions. How we made chocolate was another decision. Everybody in the industry said it's not worth making your own chocolate, you should probably use Barry Callebaut, Cargill, pre-made chocolates. I don't know if you know this, but Hershey's doesn't even make their on chocolate anymore, they outsource it to Barry Callebaut does all their chocolate. That made semi-sense, but the problem is that when we were looking at chocolate suppliers, we had to use their specs on chocolate, we had to always conform to what they wanted out of us. And at the end of the day, and this is something I'd like to talk about a little bit too, is for entrepreneurs that are going to take on big CapEx ventures, take those many steps to get there and get conviction, when we were looking at the chocolate that we were going to make, they would always tell us, when we're speaking with them, ""Hey, if you guys want custom chocolate, you got to start buying by truckloads.""We don't have the money to buy truckloads. So now we're put into a corner of where we have to choose to make a chocolate that everybody else on the market's using, and I remember my wife really pushing us to say screw this, we're going to learn how to make chocolate from scratch. We're going to control a supply chain. That's going to allow us to control fat ratios, that's going to allow us to control how it hits the mouth, and really make a chocolate that's unique to us. And again, early on, everybody said that's a waste of time, that's a waste of energy. You shouldn't be chocolate making, you should be focused on branding and putting the manufacturing together of the whole product, not on the actual chocolate. And we doubled down on that process as well too, and to this day, when everybody was crunched in the supply chain, I think we were in a really good place because we didn't have to rely on the end of the supply chain, we were just figuring out how to get cocoa in, we would get to make our own chocolate. And to this day, I really believe if you put our product in your mouth and close your eyes, you would know it's Mid-Day Squares, no matter what. Patrick: I love it. Especially on the cold chain thing. I'd pinged a few friends just in preparation for today, like what should we explore? And like you said, a lot of people said talk about cold supply chain because it's much harder, implying like all things equal, it's a bit of a knock on the business just because there's a higher hurdle. We all tend to think harder is worse, but if you can do it, it's actually definitively better because there's less competition. Just such a interesting insight. How have you handled all this on the marketing side? So I heard about you a certain way, which is through this open building thing that you've been doing, but what other orthogonal approaches have you taken to marketing? Because it sounds like the CPG business, at its core, is a marketing business. It's a branding, marketing, asset-light business, if anything, that then outsources everything else, even if it's Hershey's outsourcing chocolate making. So what have you learned in the marketing side that's differentiated, that are unique? Nick: Two really interesting insights here, two of the biggest CPG companies in the world own their media houses. Ferrero Rocher, in the book making Nutella World, fascinating book, by the way, at one point the owner says, ""Screw this. We're not outsourcing our marketing anymore. We are buying an agency, we're integrating it, we are controlling our own media house."" and Red Bull. Red Bull does not outsource any of their media, it's completely vertically integrated. And so when we were getting ready to start the company, I'll be very honest, I'm an introverted extrovert, so I spend all my weekends, pretty much me and my wife were alone in a forest up north, but my brother-in-law, who's our third partner, is the most extroverted person ever. I was watching him for a year prior to starting Mid-Day Squares, he had this company called Chase & Hunter, and that company was fascinating because he didn't really know what he was doing operationally, there was no real business. He just knew that if he went to colleges and got people excited, that there would be some type of widget that could be sold into that community. And he tried so many different things and nothing was really sticking except for this sweatshirt that said Chase & Hunter on it. What was so fascinating to me was the community that he was building. Literally every university student in Canada at one point was rocking these sweatshirts over their actual Alma Mater. Then it got out of hand, he was flown out to two NFL camps to do pregame speeches. It was crazy. I saw this happening and I'm just like what the hell is going on over here. And we would speak all the time, and he said, ""Man, I don't know. I just show everything and stuff happens."" And so we started playing with this idea where we wanted to work together really badly because I feel very strong operationally, he was really strong on storytelling. When we started putting together the pitch of how we were going to really get Mid-Day Squares out there, it was his big day. And number one, it took us three months to even convince him to join this company, but on his opening day, he put together this presentation.It was actually brilliant. At the time, I wasn't sold on it right away, but it was literally Elon Musk plus Kardashians plus Shark Tank equals Mid-Day Squares. Showed us Shark Tank's numbers, they were on to the number one viewership for their time slot. And so he's like, ""I believe this next decade is going to be for the entrepreneur what the last decade was for celebrity chefs. Our job is to tell a great story of entrepreneurship without the hustle porn, and do it in a way where we record everything, and act like a band."" And this was another fascinating ... He had all the '90s bands. He said, ""Let's take the playbook of the '90s of music bands, like the Spice Girls, Backstreet Boys, and let's act like a musical band. And instead of selling records, we sell chocolate."" That was the big pitch, and I was like, ""Okay, I see this. Not sure if it's going to work. How does this help us sell chocolate?"" He said, ""Because at the end of the day, if people become emotionally connected to us, they'll become emotionally connected to the chocolate because the chocolate, it does its job. We've created to great product, now we have to get the emotional connection in."" So literally two months before we got to market with Mid-Day Squares, again important for the listeners, because a lot of people use this as an excuse, nobody had followers. We didn't have followings. Not one of us had followings. I think my Instagram had 500 people, of all people I know. We just started recording what we were doing in development for the product and we would post it every day on our individual, saying something coming soon, something coming soon.People were excited about locally, in Montreal, what we were going to do. Oh, that's another contrarian piece that we'll get into. And then as the excitement led up, people literally started messaging us saying, ""What are you guys doing?"" And so the day that it happened, we announced Mid-Day Squares, we started a chocolate company, everybody was like what? And what we did that day was we put each product on our site for 50 cents, and we only did it in Montreal because we couldn't pay to ship it out, so we knew that okay, let's get a 50 cent credit card transaction coming through, gets rid of all people that want free product, and people went nuts buying the product. And we were on the Gram all day as it was going on. And then what ended up happening was all these orders came through, that allowed us to have more content to speak to our audience, and then every time we would make a delivery in person, we'd put this Polaroid, at the time. Again, Jake came up with this idea, content driving always back to our storytelling capabilities. We had this Polaroid that we would dress up every morning for two hours, we'd put on all sorts of different costumes, just to make people laugh, and we would find something a little personal about them that we would write saying thank you for the purchase. Those 50 cent orders turned into a viral campaign because people were getting the orders, reposting our Polaroid picture that had our at handle at Instagram, then they would come to our Instagram and we would be showing everything that we were doing, building the business, we would show the pictures, and I tell you, to this day, man, it hasn't stopped.And the production quality just kept on getting crazier, and crazier, and crazier. I would say we've built the entire business off of telling a reality television show style episodes on our social media, and then Jake had the brilliant idea of bringing that storytelling to LinkedIn. And LinkedIn is typically a boring platform for content, so we were doing Instagram storytelling on LinkedIn, and that exploded. That's how we started getting every retailer in the country was through that aspect. And our first hire ever, contrarian. Boom, another contrarian move. We hired a videographer, not a salesperson. We had no budget, and we went out there and hired literally a person to videotape everything we were doing all day and turn it into mini episodes. When we were pitching out for our first round, that was a big concern for investors. They're like, ""I'm not understanding here. You're telling us you're building a manufacturing plan. You have three people. Your first hire is a videographer. You're spending this money on this."" This is the classic, ""You should be spending your money here."" Always, ""You should spending your money here."" Okay, great. And it really just exploded to, now we have our media team's, five people. We had a producer that we stole from a television channel. She was doing stuff on TLC in the US. So it really works like a newsroom, we have storylines going at all times in Mid-Day Squares. The production and editorial team comes together in the morning. They kind of figure out where the week's going, what challenges we have ahead. And then they try to capture the story in a meaningful way, to the point where, this is how powerful storytelling is and I tell this story all the time. Last summer, there was a mass shortage of powdered coconut sugar. You could not get it in North America and we bring it in from the Philippines, usually. At that point, we couldn't even get one coming in. So they had sent us a batch that, for whatever reason, was declined by our quality assurance team. And so, now we had a gap of where we weren't going to be able to get coconut sugar for two months. If we didn't get coconut sugar for two months, that means we were screwed because we didn't have labeling. It's not like you can just put any other sugar because you don't have labels. If your labels don't meet the requirement, you can't ship.We were jonesing, we were about to go into a period of, where I really believed we were going to end up in a situation of shut down production for two months. So we were hustling, trying to get shit done, call after call. We just couldn't get a solution going. And then we were in a room and we were like, ""Why don't we just go to the Gram? Why don't we go ask our audience to help us?"" So we put out, we broadcast this message being like, ""This is what's going to happen, if this doesn't happen, could you guys help?"" I shit you not, in 24 hours, this woman from New York State gets in touch with us. Her father had a plant that basically had all this machinery in it. And at this point, we realized we were able to get granular coconut sugar. So our problem solving had shifted, instead of looking for powdered coconut sugar, let's figure out how we turn granulated coconut sugar into powdered coconut sugar because we could get granulated coconut sugar. And this woman had a machine in her father's warehouse of machinery and said, ""Hey, I'm going to send it to you. It's free of charge. All you guys got to do, is pay for shipping. We're rooting for you.""And 24 hours later, a machine shows up and we solve our problem. And ever since that day, we go to the Gram for everything, all of our problem solving. We were laughed at for a large part. For instance, we would go do dancing. Every meeting, whoever we were in front of, we make them dance. And we get up and we loosen it up, we put on some good music and we dance. A lot of people ridiculed us for being children at the beginning and acting unprofessional. That good vibe started to spread, to the point where to this day, we've been brought in from Google's offices, Facebook's offices to pump people up. And it became a huge part of our marketing effort, of getting in there and selling good vibes because what's better than a moment where you're sharing that good vibes? And I think a lot of the Mid-Day Squares' growth trajectory is showing to people, that you don't have to take yourself too seriously and you could still build a billion dollar business. You don't have to sell your soul in the making and you don't have to act the way you believe society wants you to act. And I think that's catching on big time with our fan base. Patrick: I absolutely love it. What a cool story. Maybe one of the most interesting parts of the whole story, in the story filled with interesting parts. One thing we haven't talked about, is the literal manufacturing. I'd be really curious to hear what you learned from your time in China. Obviously supply chain, the control of it, the politicization of it. It's become a topic nobody thought about ever, three years ago, to something that everyone is talking about for every business. So give us the same sets of lessons that you've learned here about, what it means to build a good manufacturing operation. What lessons you learned from China and where you see this all going in the future. Nick: So my friend's father gave us this great opportunity to go work in China and do quality assurance for everything that they were manufacturing over there, the huge lightning company. We lived in Hong Kong but we would spend Monday to Friday in all of the manufacturing districts in China. And so, I got to really live in those plants, feel them. I think one of the main things that you learn in manufacturing is that, the process of how you set up everything, is more important than when anything is running. What I mean by that is, in China, they are so regimented to the setup process. Meaning, you get all of your efficiencies in how you set up your day, your plant, where things are located, how movement structures are going to happen. If you don't get the start right, the flow doesn't happen the way you want it to happen. Making things doesn't need to be more complicated. It could be as complicated as you make it or as non-complicated as you make it. I think the mentality here in North America is, you have to start really massive in manufacturing all the time, which is not true. In China, you see mom and pop manufacturing shops being set up every day, that start with shit infrastructure and grow into incredible infrastructure. Mid-Day Square's case in point started, we got to a million dollars of revenue, manufacturing in our condo, literally. We moved all of the materials out of the condo. We got it certified by Health Canada. We had to build a second kitchen. It wasn't a polished kitchen, we just weren't allowed using our core kitchen.You start building process in line and that is what launched us into manufacturing. I've heard so many stories of processors setting up super big plants, like $50 million plants at the get go, before revenue came in and then they go bankrupt. And so, what I would say is, I'm working really hard with our government in Canada and RBCs and Scotias, to help people that want to get into manufacturing, build momentum and fund manufacturing, while their margins suck. If you started with shitty manufacturing operations, your margins are going to be low but this allows you to build momentum, to build revenue, to show to banks, to show to investors, that we have demand and now, we can actually start automating. So let me take that to Mid-Day Squares. When we started, we were at a $1.40 of manufacturing costs. So every pack costed us a buck 40. We have that down to, I want to say, 19 cents now or 18 cents. We've gotten it all the way down on there. Our product cost has decreased. The actual raw materials in purchasing power has decreased by another 40%, from where we were in the condo to now. And the reason why is, we were out there at the beginning, trying to get funding. We wanted to build a plant. Nobody, nobody, nobody would fund us, not our government, not our banks, not investors, nobody wanted to fund it. So what do you do, if you want to build a manufacturing plant? Well, you either have to have money from somebody and/or you start building demand with shitty gross margins.We've always been scrutinized for our shit gross margins early on but we had a plan of where we'd got to and I would say, Boulder Food Group, shout out Dayton Miller, Boulder Food Group took a huge risk on us, gave us that first check into the business, that allowed us to stay in the pocket and build more momentum, until we finally convinced our government to help fund our manufacturing process. And so, what I would say is, what I learned from watching the Chinese is that, they have all types of different grades of manufacturers. In North America for some reason, we don't champion that. We only champion really sophisticated manufacturing plants. We don't allow for mom and pop manufacturing and that's a mentality that needs to change, in order to build a really rich manufacturing ecosystem. You need to get people excited about that type of building, where you start slow, build momentum, get funding, invest in automation, invest in plant and go. Also, on the manufacturing piece, I just want to give a huge shout out to Lezlie, who's my partner, also my wife. She built the whole thing with her team from start to finish and just made it happen, when nobody said she could. So shout out to Lez.",6700
282,Nick Saltarelli - One Foot in Front of the Other,Future Plans," Patrick: I mean, it goes back to your whole philosophy that we've talked a lot about, one foot in front of the other, is the path to a lot of really interesting big outcomes that weren't pre-planned. The steps are what's important. Love the mentality. What should we expect from you and from Mid-Day Squares? Today, you've got three products. I highly recommend people try the peanut butter one. That's the one I'm partial to. So try that, if you wanted to see what the story's all about. But what should we expect next? Nick: We just raised $10 million to continue our growth trajectory. We're launching distribution in the US and Canada every day. So in Canada, we're in almost every grocery store, except for Costco and Walmart. And in the US, we have Sprouts, we have Whole Foods, we have Target coming on line, hopefully Trader Joe's soon. Mid-Day Squares is really, get to $100 million of revenue within the next three years in the North American market. We're finishing out the full build out of version one of the plant here. So it's 90% automated, we're getting it to 100% automation. And then right away, we're flipping the switch of, how do we expand our manufacturing footprint? And so, we're going to release two to three more flavors. To your point, what we've learned, we've learned a lot. We're going away from two squares down to one square packages. We're shifting. The next products that you see come out, are going to be super mainstream flavors, like the peanut butter flavor. So we're going to do two more ultra mainstream flavors. And then, we're trying to grow as fast globally as possible. What we've been working really, really hard on is, we finally got the blueprint of the manufacturing down packed and all of the manufacturing plant is built from items that don't come from Canada, sadly, supply chain, going back to that. So it doesn't really matter where we build these plants but it's about making sure we're servicing North America in an incredible way. And Mexico's our next stop. We have huge demand building in Mexico. The question is, how are we going to service Mexico? And it will probably have to be in a plant.And then, we need a plant in the EU because UK has one of the largest plant based communities globally. And so, Whole Foods has already started getting the ball rolling with us to distribute there but we can't do it because of the shelf life component. So I think that this is an interesting case for a lot of the listeners who will love this too and this is where history is so fucking important for entrepreneurs to read. Everybody says, ""Well, why don't you outsource your manufacturing in those countries?"" I answer that question as, ""Go read Coca-Cola's disaster and Pepsi's disasters with selling franchising rights to manufacturing."" There's also a huge company called, Bariatrix in the protein bar space, that sold their franchising rights to Europe. The European entity is now bigger than the North American entity and is trying a hostile takeover on the North American entity. The problem with selling franchising rights is, you put yourself in a really, really peculiar situation of incentives not being aligned. It's almost impossible to get those incentives aligned on contracts. I would argue and this is what I say to our investors a lot too, ""It's crazy, I understand to have to run manufacturing globally but if you go look at what Coca-Cola is having to spend now to buy back the rights from manufacturers that they sold their manufacturing rights, it's pretty obvious for me, that manufacturing is a core competency, is something we should hold very close to our chest.""And so, going back to the beginning of our conversation, I am a huge believer, Leslie is a huge believer, Jake's a huge believer and my partners, in tight SKU count, global distribution. And so, 90% of our energy goes in every day. I know you asked me that the other day, where do you spend most of your time? It's fundraising to continue to grow our footprint, from a manufacturing perspective and two, getting the operations down packed because once you have the ops down packed, you will create a competitive moat that very few are able to compete with. If I was sitting here with Peter Rahal, who started RxBar, who I'm the biggest fan of, I would say, I wish he didn't sell RxBar because he had more left in the tank to bing that distribution globally and really push forward and own that supply chain. And I think founders shy away from it because it is very hard to do it and you get tired. But when you get tired, I say just take a one month vacation and come back. It's better than selling to the conglomerates. So that's my opinion. Patrick: Love it. Well, Nick, this is so cool. I love the internet in the sense that, we could meet randomly yesterday and have this great conversation today. I really appreciate the time today. I ask everybody the same closing question, what is the kindest thing that anyone's ever done for you? My suspicion is your answer to this one's going to be interesting. Nick: I know exactly what it is. I had so many kind things but I'm going to give a shout out to my cousin, Frank. My dad passed away and my cousin, Frank moved into my house for nine months, to just be with me because he knew I was having a really rough time. He stopped everything in his life. He was 34 years old, in the prime of his life, stopped his whole life. Got out of his apartment and just moved into our house and just stayed there for nine months and didn't leave, until the house was ready to mourn the death properly. And I think about that all the time. I don't think he understands how big of an impact. I think he downplays it when you say that. It's the nicest thing anybody's ever done for me. Patrick: What an awesome, incredible way to close the conversation. I suspect like me, most listening are going to be rooting hard for you and your partners in Mid-Day Squares. Such a fun, interesting conversation, totally different than typical- Nick: Do you mind if I plug the podcast for everybody that's listening? Patrick: Of course. Nick: We go deep. Our podcast is a round table between us three founders. It's called, Mid-Day Squares uncensored. We round table the trials and tribulations of growing the business. Patrick: I love it. Nick: It's pretty deep. And if you want to go deeper on Mid-Day Squares, we go deep on there. Patrick: I'm going to be a listener. Again, Nick, this has been a total pleasure. Thanks so much for your time. Nick: Thank you brother.This site uses cookies to improve your browsing experience. By using this site, you are consenting to this policy.",1593
283,Jenny Johnson - Seven Decades of Investing Expertise,Introduction," Patrick: My guest today is Jenny Johnson, president and CEO of one of the world's largest asset managers, Franklin Templeton. Jenny joined the business in 1988, and has worked in the organization ever since. In early 2020, she became CEO of Franklin, which now manages some 1.5 trillion in assets under management. I should, of course, note that I met Jenny as our two firms explored a partnership, which we cemented three months ago when we announced that Franklin Templeton would be acquiring O'Shaughnessy Asset Management. During our conversation, we discussed Jenny's thoughts on leadership, how she manages the needle moving problem that afflicts many large companies, and the ways in which she sees private markets becoming more accessible to retail investors in the future. Please enjoy this great conversation with Jenny Johnson.",175
284,Jenny Johnson - Seven Decades of Investing Expertise,Four Ps of Leadership," Patrick: So Jenny, I was toying with where to begin our conversation today. We're going to talk about so many different areas of interest, but leadership is one that to me, having spent a little time with you, I'm perhaps most interested to dive into the details on. So my opening question for you is about the roles of a CEO, both things that the CEO should do and shouldn't do. I'll start with the positive, the things that a CEO should do. What do you think are the most important roles and functions of a leader in the CEO seat? Jenny: I always like to say that I came up with this, my four P's of leadership, and so I'm going to start there. And it's people, passion, purpose, and persistence. And I think people one is, what's the job of the CEO? The number one job is get the right team, get the right people who are running things. Passion, love what you do, and you're not going to work a day in your life. If you don't love what you do, chances are you might be good at something, but you're not going to be great at it. There's going to be other people who are just more passionate, who think about it more often, and they're going to be much better at it. So you got to love what you do. Purpose, great leaders, I think have always done this. This has now become something people talk about, but talk about what you do in a purposeful way, and that will inspire your team to follow and to lead in their various areas. What do I mean? In our business, we talk about we help people achieve the most important goals in their lives. Unfortunately it takes kind of money to do a lot of things that you want to do. And so every day at Franklin Templeton, people are coming in thinking, I carry this responsibility to help people do those things that are the most important in their lives. And I jokingly tell the story about my three daughters, ask any of them would they follow me in finance? And they all pretty much said no. And one of them said, I want to do something that helps people. And my comment was, are you kidding me? This really helps people. So that's the purpose.And then persistence. I mean, Patrick, you know, you run a successful business. It's much more about you're going to have those trip ups, you're going to have those failings. It's much more about how do you get up, dust yourself off and move on, that determines whether you're successful or not. And so I think it's having that persistence to just continue to think, I got to think of creative ways to navigate this situation and be successful with it. So I think those apply to any CEO or any leader. And then I think what we've learned in this time of COVID is that I think it used to be that leaders had to sort of have a distance and maybe show a stoic nature. And what we're finding is that more successful leaders, I think lead with some empathy. Because in this period of COVID I had to understand that everybody had different situations. Somebody said, we're all in the same storm but we're not in the same boat. It's recognizing that as a leader and having some empathy, and I think that that was really important during this time. Patrick: Part of the answer might be that last P, persistence, but I'd love to understand the hardest aspects of doing the first three well. All of those things make tremendous sense and I think are just correct, but each of them is hard, harder in practice than it is in theory. And so maybe starting with people, my friend Dennis [Huang] had this great idea for CEOs that their job is to get people all in and keep them all in, which I think encompasses a lot of what you've said, too. What are the hard, though, dimensions of people? To get great people is the goal. What is the difficulty along that path that you've most commonly faced? Jenny: Well, first of all, I would say that talent in the business world is a bit of a Venn diagram. These are the people I love to hang out with, these are the people I should work with. It's great when they overlap, but don't confuse the two. I think one of the challenges as you're building a business and working with people, you get to build friendships and deep relationships. And sometimes the company changes and job changes, the industry changes and maybe they're not right for that same job. It's about making sure that you're keeping the people in the right seats, and that could be hard because sometimes people, the job grows out of their capabilities in that role. And then you got to make tough decisions. And I think it was Jack Welsh, who always said he was slower to make changes then, and when he looks back that was one of his Achilles' heels. And I think that's every CEO's challenge. Patrick: In your senior leadership team, what do you look for? Is there a common set of traits that you think defines everyone that you're interested in working with at the highest level? Jenny: You're building a team. You follow basketball, I think it was the dream team in the Olympics and didn't do that well, right? They all played great individual playing, but they didn't play as a team. So you're building a team. They got to work together. They're rowing the boat in the same direction, and their complementary to each other. So the skill sets are going to be different. And then one of the things we talk about is no meeting after the meeting, you as a senior executive's job it is to speak up, give your opinion, honest non-political opinion to what you think to be helpful. And then once a decision's made everybody works together to support it. Patrick: One of the most common challenges I've observed amongst even great leaders is knowing the degree to which to get involved in individual decisions. And I'm curious if you have a framework or a way of thinking about this, where there is some right level, probably in each situation, but it's very hard as a leader to know when to be more or less involved. How do you process that sort of issue? Jenny: I kind of grew up in the bowels of the organization, having run operations and technology. I can find myself sometimes getting into... Patrick: The weeds. Jenny: Some weeds, but here's how I think about my time. I think 40% of my time should be spent on clients, prospects, industry speaking, external facing, that should be about 40%. 30% should be on day to day. So my team should be things, I should just be getting involved in those decisions where people are struggling to actually agree. You have a great team, hopefully they don't agree in everything, and so that's where I'll get called in. And if that number edges up more than 30% consistently, I probably have the wrong people. And then I think 30%, because we're living in this dramatic time of technological innovation, since I'm a third generation running this company, I focus on making sure it's here for the fourth and fifth generation. So that means decisions today are probably seeds planted today, are relevant from the next generation. So 30% is really honestly spent on disruption, on areas that I think could be disruptive to this industry, not focused on the industry, but frankly focused on areas outside the industry that may be relevant someday to this industry. Patrick: How do you think you behave most differently as a leader, given that you are the third generation? There's fascinating research on family led companies through time. Some of the longest lasting corporations, Japanese ones that have been around for 1,000 years, have a strong family component to them. And I shared the fact that I've worked in a family business, and for me it's second generation, it seems like a sword that cuts both ways. So I would be really curious to know experience and how you think it's affected you and your leadership style. Jenny: On the whole, I actually think it's got benefit. But you're right, it cuts both ways. And so why do I think it has a benefit? I think one of the challenges of being a public company CEO is this complete focus on quarterly earnings by analysts, by investors. I mean we're institutional investors, right? So we push CEOs on that, what does it mean next quarter? And you sort of get about a three year run as a CEO to have investments show signs of being successful. And sometimes it takes longer than that. So I think the good news is the ability to think really generationally, I think makes a difference. Because I'll make decisions that I think may not... I mean, our focus on blockchain and infrastructure investments, I honestly think they're kind of a 10 year out massively disruptive. There'll be some shorter term disruption, but I better focus on them today. And I actually think that's probably getting shorter and shorter in that window than maybe when I first thought about it, but keeping your eye on those things and making investments that you know are all about longer term trends to ensure that you're positioning the company to play in there, which sometimes our family still has a concentrated ownership in the business. So we're able to make that longer term, even if it meant a short term maybe impact on earnings, because you're making sure that your positioned for longer term growth of the company. Patrick: What advice would you give other either parents or children, about working with their parents or children in a serious way, where you're building something that has multi-generational past or potential future? What are the key lessons that you've learned that you would offer to others? Jenny: I think one thing is you have to put the company first, and you have to leave behind the natural dynamics that come in a relationship of older siblings, younger siblings, parent, child kind of thing. And you come to the office, you got to come to the office and be focusing on what's right for the business. The good news is you all are focused on what is right for the long term business because it impacts you over the long run. It's not like you could just walk out. I mean, I guess you could just walk out and get a job somewhere else, but it's not quite the same. Patrick: It would be very strange. Jenny: Yeah. Yeah.",2341
285,Jenny Johnson - Seven Decades of Investing Expertise,Technology's Role in Asset Management," Patrick: Well, I'd love to talk about technology. You came up through, as you said, the operations and technology and ran that side of the business. And you've done a lot and spoken a lot about your feelings on the role technology will play in the future of asset management. This is a fascinating topic to me because obviously it's a personal interest, but also I just feel as though this industry has been fairly slow to embrace and adopt transformative new technologies, like the model of taking someone's money, investing it, charging a fee has kind of been fixed for a long time. How do you think about the role that technology is and will play in the asset management business model and industry? Jenny: From on the investment side, I'm still a big believer in active management. I think passive has its place to complement exposures and things. I still am a big believer in risk adjusted returns. Having said that, the kind of business school model of you build a spreadsheet with P and L and you assume sales and things, I think it's going to be all about leveraging AI and data in gaining information edges that give you insights that will complement the model, but they're going to be important. And if you haven't included them in how you think about making investments, and those kind of data scientists on your investment team, chances are if you're an active manager you're going to have a hard time keeping up. And I'm going to give you an example, because I happened to have been, early in my career, a consumer lender. So we used to, we did auto loan financing. So we'd look at six things, your FICO score, your debt to income, how long you were employed, all those things you would imagine are relevant. Well today we bought a company called Random Force that does leveraged AI against data sources, unique data sources to determine loans and what loans to make investments. And they found micro signals like you didn't capitalize the name of your employer, and these other micro signals were out there than you had X percentage more likely to charge off. Or if you applied for the loan after a certain time at night, you are a higher risk.These things, if you're not adding those types and staying on top of those types of trends, you're going to have adverse selection on a loan portfolio that you're going to get, and you're going to end up with much greater losses. So I think that's relevant to any kind of investment. So I think AI's really important, and data, and broad sources of data that others don't have is going to be a real edge. Well, as you know, I think customization of people's investment portfolios are going to have a lot less pooled vehicles and a lot more individually held accounts that are tax efficient, that are going to reflect your personal values. You're going to be able to express, especially as ESG data gets better and better on companies, you're going to be able to express your investments in such a way that it includes kind of what your passions are. And you're going to be able to measure those decisions, whether they add alpha or take away from your returns in a much more granular way. The customizations, you know with Canvas, that's exactly what you do. And I think taking that and bringing active pools and putting them through those screens is going to be the future. And I think that blockchain is going to dramatically reduce the infrastructure costs of the business. If you ever run a back office in kind of financial services firm, you know that there's a heck of a lot of cost in just reconciling between systems.Well, immediately, if it's made, if it's imprinted on the chain, it's there, you don't have to reconcile. There's no worry about what the source of truth is. That's going to compress a lot of costs in the industry, I think over time, and have much faster settlement. So I think that's going to change. And then the ability to have say, blockchain where you have smart contracts is going to unlock historically illiquid assets, fractionalize them. It's going to take out a lot of the frictional costs of transferring that asset. So it's going to be able to essentially open it up to the masses. And the example I like to use is, imagine if you could sell the Empire State Building to a million people, and they got 1000000th of their rent in their token, and I can sell it to you without going to the title company so there's no frictional cost, I just sell you my token. Imagine what you can unlock in the world. And I think that that's one of the reason I say focused on blockchain, I think it's going to be really interesting. Patrick: You obviously know this part of the business far better than most, and certainly better than me. I'd love to understand one level deeper on those internal costs and difficult and frictions that exist, that something like blockchain may alleviate for asset management specifically. Maybe just describe how it is today and what we may not appreciate about reconciliation and settlement and the costs that no one thinks about, right? That's an investor in a mutual fund. Like they're not thinking about the guts behind some of this stuff. So educate us a little bit on those guts and why you think they could get so much better and why that matters. Jenny: Number one is just, you have a whole bunch of systems that you bring in to do something. You piece them together over time. I mean, when I started at Franklin Templeton, I remember my brother brought in the first computer into the company to do some help in some trading. And nowadays, and there's a lot of tech debt in financial services business because we built these things as the capability and technology computing improved. Well, then you have to reconcile one system to the next. So there's a lot of costs embedded in that. That's one piece. And you truly have in blockchain where it's recorded, and that record is a source of truth, and that becomes basically a way in which everybody can agree, including taxing authorities, everybody. This is the source of truth. That reduces a lot of the systems that exist out there. Think about a foreign exchange contract or any kind of derivative contract that requires collateral. Today there's often somebody in a spreadsheet. That's looking at it saying, ""Well, my counterparty owes me X today. We've done the calculation. These covenants have been hit, or this is what the balance is."" And then they go and request the payment. Well, all that can be programmed into the smart contract so it actually automates the process. And there's no disagreement about it because it was what was agreed to in the purchase of contract, it's literally programmed in there. It's going to take time because these things have to talk to each other. People have to agree on protocols. It always takes a lot more time to roll these things out, but I think you will see it over time drive down the cost in the industry. Patrick: I know you've built a very impressive team filled with senior leaders from formally, from other parts of the business that are dedicated to at crypto, specifically. You mentioned this 10 year type be this probably represents for Franklin. It brings to mind a topic that I'm always fascinated by for big companies and those running them, which I'll call it 'The move the needle problem'. This is a question about disruptive innovation that very often, the things that represent the biggest threats in hindsight are so small and tiny to begin with that you just Don them many mind, and then they grow very quickly and you're not well positioned. How do you think about disruption from within and not getting sucked into that? Not doing something because it doesn't quote unquote, move the needle. Jenny: Here's how I think, and kind of advise people during times like this. So first of all, the type of personality of the person who's the disruptor is often not focused on getting the job done today. Like he's always curious here, he's always curious about what's happening over here and you start talking to him and it's kind of esoteric because one of the biggest problems with disruption is people can talk about it, but the words don't exist. So they don't exist, so they can't explain it that well and other people can't figure it out. And so if you're trying to do today's problem and you have somebody over here, it's like a fly bothering you, right? They're just talking about stuff that's not relevant to solving your today problem. I got to make an investment today. I cut the nav today. I don't really care what you're talking about. So the way we're doing it is we have really created a subgroup and I attend meetings with this group to talk to them, to understand and frankly protect them, make sure that they get the appropriate budget, make sure that they're able to get the resources. Frankly, give them a little bit of a pass on being able to present a business plan and business case to say ""Here's when the profits are going to come."" it's almost more like an R and D effort. And I think if you don't protect them, they get squashed within an organization. Eventually they're frustrated and they leave.",1991
286,Jenny Johnson - Seven Decades of Investing Expertise,M&A and Franklin's Structure," Patrick: How do you think about the combination of internal projects like that with an M&A. Strategy? And obviously Franklin's been prolific, especially as you've been CEO in acquiring pieces in a way that seems from the outside very deliberate in terms of what they're contributing to in terms of an overall vision or purpose. I would just love to dive in a little bit to how you start with some sort of vision and what that vision is for Franklin. And then how you decide between like the internal group approach versus the M&A approach. And then I'll ask some questions on tactically about M&A too. Jenny: For us an M&A was more filling immediate gaps. That was the things that we were looking at versus some of the stuff that we're doing in the development ourselves. And to be honest, if you could buy it, it's often better than trying to build it yourself. It's hard within companies... I laugh because you take a corporate IT department. And I remember an entrepreneur saying, ""Yeah, you're never going to have innovation in there because we put so much compliance, so much testing. There's so much fear about something going wrong, that it would be hard to really be innovative."" Eventually it'd just be too expensive. The entrepreneur pieces it together, goes out and sells it and then fills in the blank to make it scalable after. You know, our M&A strategy was very much around areas in the business that we knew we needed to fill in product gaps, really, or capability gaps.In the case of say Canvas, which you guys had, I mean, we looked at that and said, ""Boy, if we don't buy this now, we maybe could build it in 18 months. Oh. But by the way, the whole industry will have moved in that 18 months. You'll continue to build your capabilities on that and we'll continue to be behind."" So sometimes why to just say, ""I've got to make sure I'm at market today."" And so that was really what we were doing. And then of course, things like Lexington Partners was about, we wanted to be bigger in the alternative space. We had real estate with Clarion.We had private credit with Benefit Street Partners and Lexington Partners really brought us private equity. And we know in the asset management business, there's a view that 49% of revenues will come from the alt space. So we need it to be bigger in that space. And I'm passionate, I think there's more opportunity for illiquid assets to be brought because of the ill liquidity of premium is becoming bigger and bigger, will be created in such a way, packaged in such a way, that they'll be available to the retail consumer. So we wanted to make sure we had that core capability. And then what we're doing on the development side, we have an incubator. So we look at least 20, seriously look at 20 companies a month to bring into our incubator. And they are all in the area of potential disruption to our business. And so it gives us a front row seat to being able to understand how things are disrupting. And we make an investment in working on our campus. We're setting up some additional incubators around the globe, because we think disruption can happen anywhere. And those are the types of things where you're kind of investing, and then there some things we're just doing internally. Now when you do it internally, you have to make sure you're also staying aware of how others are also developing the same idea, because you may want to stop and just go acquire somebody else. Patrick: What is the hardest thing in your experience about effective M&A? What are the things that just keep you up at night or are repeatedly difficult as you go through these processes? Jenny: What we say is, ""Look, the investment banker's going to tell you why it's a great price and why it's a great strategic fit. You're never going to talk about culture."" And in the end I think deals are successful or not depending on whether there's a culture class or culture integration. We have passed on many deals that we think were strategically made a lot of sense. We just felt like the cultures would mesh. Patrick: The other unique aspect of Franklin is this sort of hybrid structure. That's somewhere between the, I'll call it like pure monolith structure, like single product from the top to the bottom of the organization, all the way to like maybe a Berkshire Hathaway where there's all these businesses, they don't really talk to each other, they're loosely related or not related at all. Franklin has interesting hybrid approach where you have a number of different investment groups. There is more connective tissue between them, it seems, again from the outside looking in, than Berkshire model, but it's also not a monolith like an apple or something that's just got a couple products. Teach me a little bit about managing where you are on that spectrum. Like how much you think about being deliberate about picking your point on that spectrum and how to do it well. Jenny: I actually think we're pretty simple in that if you think about it, we have one capability which is investing people's money to get risk adjusted returns. We want to be able to do that all the way across the spectrum from very, very low risk, to much more higher risk, high potential alpha, but high volatility and be comfortable with any of those as long as we describe what it is. So we want to make sure that somebody comes in, we have the full spectrum. And then we package it in whatever way our clients want to receive it. So as I mentioned, Canvas, we know that the world is moving to this separately managed account with tax efficiency and ESG overlay. That's just one way in which we can package it. We might do a collective investment trust that uses an ETF, a mutual fund. All those are just packaging of our capabilities. You want to make sure that the packaging is appropriate for both what the client's looking for from a liquidity standpoint and how the investment mandate is. The first thing was to say, ""Well, we're going to..."" If we're offering all these different independent investment teams, they really have to be independent. Clients sign up for an investment team, which means whatever they define, and we've been very clear. You tell us what you need from your investment process. Do you need your own technology? Does trading need to be on your desk? Some of our teams say, ""I need to have trading sitting next to me,"" others say, ""I'll use the global trading. I like the pass the book,"" follow this some kind of model. So our investment teams are really given that flexibility to define those things. Risk management, pre-trade compliance, but all those things are integrated in each of our individual investment teams.What we're finding is you almost need portfolio specialists who are helping on the distribution process to really be able to talk and they have to sit with the team so they can talk specifically as if they're a PM as part of distribution. So that is completely independent. And then we say, we sit on a 1.6 trillion dollar platform where we can invest in technology to provide more customized solutions where we can invest in data that can be shared across our investment teams. Giving our partners comfort around risk management, that we're not cutting corners around risk management and compliance. And then we can do investments in things like disruptive technology that we is going to impact us in the future. But the most exciting part of all this is that our investment teams have recognized, you know what we said, the competition is outside the wall. So actually leverage the strengths inside the wall. So I'll give you an example. When COVID hit in 2020, we just announced Legg Mason Deal. I don't know if you remember but sure you do, the treasury market, the world's most liquid category out there, froze up. So we got a call together of our three fixed income teams, the CIOs up at Legg Mason, Brandy Wine, Franklin Templeton, our private credit group, and just got them on the phone to talk about what they were all seeing. We did this weekly. So we focused through an understanding.So we're where the markets were and what everybody's perspective was. And after about six weeks of doing it, I mentioned to the guys, ""Hey, listen, maybe we should stop things calm down."" I guess it was a couple, it was a little longer than that, ""but things have calmed down. I don't like to have meetings for meetings. Should we make this events for event?"" And sure enough, the CIO said, ""This is really, really valuable to us. Never had this opportunity."" And so we have these quarterly CIO events where the teams can get together and just talk about what people are seeing. And we think that that will naturally give them opportunities to have more insights. It's great to a growth and value person. I think there's a personality difference. I don't think they're going to necessarily agree, but you know they'll make better decisions when they can be informed by have those kind of conversations with each other. And then finally we see the world moving towards solutions. So as you move towards solutions products, that's a combination of all these. That's a chef walk into the best stocked kitchen and coming up with the best meal. And so as the world's moving to more solutions, product capabilities, having that really diverse capability, we think gives us a big advantage.",2042
287,Jenny Johnson - Seven Decades of Investing Expertise,Active vs. Passive Strategies & Decision Making Frameworks," Patrick: There's kind of three things that weave all that together in terms of the business model itself, where you've got the investment strategies, you've got the delivery mechanism, which we've talked about out, and then you've got sort of the revenue model. Historically it's been pretty constant. You charge a percent of assets under management, maybe some performance fee in certain cases. Say a bit more about what you mentioned earlier around active versus passive in that first bucket. What a good investment strategy is to you. The passive trend has been, we don't have to talk about it. Like it's obvious. It's huge. Tons of assets is that direction. Franklin obviously has a suite of active strategies. So what are the pros and cons of active versus passive in your mind against the backdrop of passive sort of winning share over the last couple decades? Jenny: Passive's going to win... You often win share in momentum markets. And this has been an extreme one for a couple reasons. One, you've just had technological innovation. I think there's six companies in the S and P 500 that have accounted for like 50% of the earnings. Like that's crazy. So if your strategy was market weighted investments, that's going to win. And then you had this backdrop of just massive government intervention where they're pumping money into the system and interest rates kept low. Where were you going to put your money? Were you going to put it in zero checking account? Or were you going to say, ""Well, heck I'll go into the equity market."" If I didn't have access to the private markets, I went in the equity markets. And so that became kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy. But I described it a little bit like... If I said to you, Patrick, ""I want you to buy a car and I want you to drive down the street and I want you to get the best... You got to get there safely, but the best value for a mile."" You're going to go buy the cheapest car with the least safety features on it. As long as the road is well paved and not a lot of twists and turns.But if part of that drive means you got to drive to the mountains of a snow storm or a toddler's going to run in there, or it's really windy, you're going to wish your car has some safety features on it. You're just going to be better, going to want a four wheel drive. You're going to want to pay up for those things. We have been in a decade of a straight well paved road. And now we're going to move into this. And I think we've already seen it with the Fed's kind of discussion about potentially raising rates and things. It's going to just be different from what it was. And if that you want people who are at the wheel driving. I remember somebody saying that ""Pilots say in times of great turbulence, that's when they go off autopilot and start flying the plane."" We're coming up to that scenario. My fear is people become complacent when you've had such wins over the last decade to say, ""Ah, I'm just going to go continue passive."" And what I say is, ""While market beta is market beta, beta got a lot riskier."" For example, when Tesla was put in, if you measure beta by volatility, what it was put in to the S and P. And so I'm not sure that people understand the increasing risk that's happened as you've had this great concentration of single companies. Patrick: One of the things I've always found really interesting about the active passive debate, if you study Bogle's early writings, was that really, he was talking more about cost reduction than market efficiency, which I think most people think active passive, they think different versions of the vision market hypothesis. But Bogle is very focused on cost that cost compound taxes, management fees, whatever turnover is expensive. And that's really the enemy more than anything else. How do you think about costs in our industry, where they've trended, how they might trend in the future and how that affects a business like yours? Jenny: So the interesting thing as I said, I think when you move to more of these separates accounts, you're going to pay for the active management and people need to focus on, ""I invested a dollar. What did I get back?"" That's the answer. I invested a dollar. What did I get back? If I paid 5 cents and you gave me 10 cents back, maybe I'm okay with five cents and you gave me 10 cents back, maybe I'm okay with five cents versus I paid you a penny and I got two cents back, right? You need to think about the net number. As you drive up, a lot of the costs were because you had back office costs, say mutual funds, plus you had distribution fees embedded in the mutual fund. But post the financial crisis where, basically, regulators globally said, ""We want to have more transparency around distribution fees."" The world went to fee based and a lot of the first fee based advisors said, ""Well, mutual funds are too expensive, I'm going to go to ETFs."" But really what they were doing there is it was because there was service fees and distribution fees embedded in mutual funds that weren't in an ETF. Those were either paid directly to broker and then your advisor was getting paid directly. I think that what we're seeing as the world has gone more to fee based is that you're seeing the kind of cost of the underlying investment products just get culled down to the investment management fee. You've reduced a lot of those other costs. Patrick: I like the idea of the driver and turbulence or something and obviously there's a lot of it, I don't know how many different investment teams within Franklin, a lot, many of them have maybe opposite views of the world, deep value versus aggressive growth or something like this. How do you think about helping clients navigate to those different firms, given that they themselves, like you said, the three CIO's on that call, depending on the asset class, might have wildly divergent views. It's going to be an interesting thing that Franklin doesn't seem to have a house view on things. What does that mean for how you talk to clients and help guide them to the right choice? It's kind of an interesting problem. Jenny: First of all, we're big on working with distribution partners because it is hard to navigate all these things without a financial advisor who really understands what you're individual goals are. You can help your kids pay for college, what's a comfortable number for retirement? And you can ask a lot of questions but people think that ROBO is going to get rid of financial advisors but I'd say remember TurboTax was going to get rid of all the CPAs and who's the number one user of TurboTax? CPAs, right? I think a lot of these tools are going to enable the advisor to be better and be more of a wealth manager, which is what you're seeing. They're no longer just managing investments, they're helping people with ... They're obviously doing tax efficiency on the investments but they're helping people on educating their children, financial planning, making sure their estates are set up. It's just a whole different deal that advisors are happy to provide to clients because they're able to be more efficient with tools like goal space tools. I think, at Franklin Templeton, we like to educate the advisor who's spending their entire day focused on being educated on this, on products, to be able to decide what's appropriate for clients and, some cases, if the advisor comes back and says, ""Well, I really want a solution base, I want it to be an income solution or capital preservation or capital appreciation."" We're able to then point them to the appropriate products internally. Patrick: It reminds me of a question I meant to ask during the leadership portion of the discussion, which is around making decisions by building consensus within your team versus by edict or by fiat. I'm always interested in these spectrums of how to reach good decisions, especially when they're important. What have you learned about that same spectrum about when consensus is helpful and appropriate and when fiat and edict from a leader is important when making important decisions? Jenny: In the end, you're going to have to make a decision and I think that the first thing is it's really important if you have the right team around you to get their feedback. I don't think there should be ever confused between consensus on it and making sure that you're getting, everybody's heard, that you're listening through, because I can't tell you the number of times I'm predisposed to one setting, people bring other perspectives and it completely changes my view on it. And, naturally, sometimes things naturally happen by consensus. An executive team will talk, they'll talk through the things you get, but you feel like you've thoroughly covered it and everybody sort of comes to a natural conclusion. It really ends up being the CEO happened to make a decision when there's kind of a tie internally, where there's disagreement around it and then that's your job, is to step up and make the call. Patrick: What have been some of the most formative experiences just in your individual career, even focused on a period before you were running the business? What episodes, and we can do as many ... I love these context, historical episodes in terms of what they taught you and how they shaped you, what are some of those that pop to mind as a discreet period, it could be a single day, a single decision, a period, you pick but I'd love to go through a few of them, hear the story and understand how it impacted your world view. Jenny: I always say to people the job that gave me probably the most training for being prepared to be CEO was when I was running a small little division within Franklin, which was an auto loan company and back in the '80s, we had bought a bank and we were trying to figure out how to grow and we started auto loans and I learned a lot there and we got in trouble. Here's the thing, Patrick, and this will surprise you but when you're lending people money, it's a different decision than when you're investing and they're handing you money. We probably, right out of the gate, were too lenient with our lending people money and we got into some regulatory issues and I just remember, I'd wake up, I literally would find myself lying in my bed in the fetal position thinking about the regulators or the board that I had to talk to. My father gave me ... He was really sweet, he gave me, I still have it, it's like a little Xerox copy and it's a frog is being swallowed by a duck but the frog has managed to reach around and is squeezing the duck's neck so he can't actually swallow the frog and it just says, ""Never give up."" My dad's kind of way of just saying, ""Stick it out, you'll figure out how to work through it."" And that was what it was, it was hand to hand combat.Sometimes I use the example when I was climbing Kilimanjaro, you're on the last day of the summit and that's the hardest day, they say, ""Pulley, pulley, slowly, slowly."" And all I would think is, ""I have a splitting headache but I'm just going to get five more steps."" And you do five steps and then you do five more and sometimes when you're doing the most difficult things, you think about just the steps you have to do in front of you but the key is that you keep going. And so, I probably learned the most lessons in my career during that window of crisis and I guess what I would say to people is the old never let a good crisis go by without figuring out how to turn it into an opportunity, it is not only for your business but it's for you personally. Those character building moments also gave me a lot of confident to be able to lead in other difficult situations. Patrick: How do you manage emotions through those periods when, it feels like we have our emotions for good reason, they're very productive things in terms of encouraging the right behavior from an evolutionary standpoint. They're also productive in a crisis, they focus the mind, but they have side effects. What have you learned about managing emotions through these duck swallowing the frog type episodes? I love that story, by the way. Jenny: I think there are times where you have to compartmentalize as a leader, turn on the logic and turn out the emotion, which you have to make sure you don't do in your personal life and so you have to work on that - being able to bifurcate those things but I think you have to just be focused on what the tasks are ahead of you and solving it. Patrick: The other really interesting experience that you and the company have had is, because it's a company that's been around a long time and has had periods of unbelievable success, I think there's a long, when my team looked, multi year period where it might've been the best performing stock in the S&P500 for a shockingly long period of time. Jenny: 25 years. Patrick: 25, that's- Jenny: I don't know if it was the best performing but we outperformed Berkshire Hathaway for 25 years in a row. Patrick: There was multiple stats that were incredibly eye popping, which obviously has a certain feeling to it going through that period, love to hear what that felt like, and then there's been periods like maybe the last 10 years where the entire industry of asset managers generally obviously has not been the top, nothing compared to Facebook and Apple and these other companies. Managing when there's a public daily mark on your stock price, it just has to impact how you think about managing the team and the motivation and the narrative. Just talk to me a little bit about contrasting those two periods of just being literally number one for a long period versus not necessarily being number one. Jenny: Your stock is a currency of your employees so when it's doing really, really well in itself, it helps you a lot in retention but it also, the one challenge is with that is that you're trying to manage the growth so you're just trying to keep everything going together and band aiding certain things and you don't address all the issues because you don't want to lose the momentum on the growth but I think that's a challenge. When I joined this business in the 1980's, I think the average asset manager had a 26% return on equity. It was just a great business to be in. You just had to be pretty good, you didn't have to be great and you didn't have to be really, really tough on making sure you're efficient in how you are improving your business and then when things turn, then the business got tougher, we had to wake up and say, ""Okay, we have the right talent, are we doing the right processes? How do we improve this business? We've got to be more efficient."" And those are tough times. Those are times where you're managing out long time loyal employees, those are times when you're having to face that maybe you weren't as smart as you thought, you were just in a great industry and you had to really face and honestly face what you needed to do to improve the business. Patrick: I like that honesty face concept. There's that old saying like if you always know an A player, you kind of always know a C player, the B is the thing that's kind of hard to figure out. How do you manage those sorts of things, whether it's opportunities for M&A or within the business or strategic priorities, how maniacal are you about prioritization and strategy and just focusing on the best versus spreading the team too thin, given how many different things you do? Jenny: I think that's always a challenge, especially right now, there's so many initiatives that you can get excited about and do and try to figure out how to prioritize when we all have to be realistic, that we don't know which things are going to ultimately win. In some cases, you just give a little bit, it's spreading seeds and just seeing kind of what grows. In other cases, you're saying, ""I'm going to really focus on this, put my attention here and see because I'm betting that this is going to be a winner but I'm not betting so much that I'm going to completely close down something over here."" And I think there's times in the business where you feel that technological disruption such that you have to have more seeds that you're willing to spread and other times where it's clear what the focus ... For us, we knew back in 2018 that the industry, there was greater and greater allocations to the alternative space so we knew we needed to acquire managers because that's a really hard thing to do as far as to organically grow it but it's also really hard to buy. They're tough properties to get. There, you're focused on making sure, you had to win there. How much time you spent on other things like building fintech capabilities that support our advisors or the work we're doing and watching and other stuff like that, those are more you're almost planting seeds around there because you don't know what wins.",3810
288,Jenny Johnson - Seven Decades of Investing Expertise,Alternative Asset Managers and the Industry More Broadly," Patrick: Why is it hard to buy those kind of alternative type asset managers relative to maybe a traditional asset manager? Jenny: Let's just take private equity for a start. Chances are the people who are managing it know a heck of a lot more about the business than you're ever going to know and know about the holdings in the business and you have to ask yourself why are they selling it? If they're suddenly selling it and they want to be out or they're willing to stay but are they really going to be engaged because they've just made a huge amount of money and are they going to stay engaged? And so, you're trying, in that process, to assess and you hope to build it where they get some long term benefit by being engaged but what are the motivations for selling and can you ... Because you're really, in this business, this is a people business, you're buying a team when you buy a company and so can you keep that team really engaged? Patrick: This may be a dumb question but even the word alternative's somewhat confusing. The only thing I could say that's unifying about them is like a fee structure, it seems. What does alternative mean to you? Why is it an interesting category? Jenny: To me it’s more private assets, not traded in a more public form. I think that's how I think of alternatives. Patrick: And so, this idea of the Empire State Building analogy is a nice fun one to toy with intellectually, do you think that that's the fate of all of these things? That in some way, shape or form, the trend is just going to be less frictions, more liquid, more frequent marks for, effectively, all assets over time? Jenny: Well, I think large institution, big sources of capital, big Sovereign funds and others, they don't necessarily need things to be tokenized, although I've talked to some of them that are already thinking about it so especially if you have government assets that you ultimately want to privatize, tokenization's an interesting way to approach that because I just think that, ultimately, watching is a more efficient kind of back office. Again, this assumes everybody's talking to each other using the same protocols. This is really hard to do. It's sort of like you have all these people speaking all these different languages and you say, ""Well, we're going to get to a universal language."" There's a lot of friction in stopping that from happening but I also think that people are genuinely motivated. Just think private equity versus public equity, you're seeing companies wait much longer to go public. Frankly, there's a lot of regulation around going public and there's so much money in the private space that companies are saying, ""Well, I can wait out a little bit longer."" But then what's happening is that real growth projectory in those early years is captured in the private markets, which, right now, is not really accessible to the average 401K guy. The average American who's putting their money away for retirement isn't capturing that growth cycle that used to be in the IPO and mutual funds all the time that they would capture it.And so, I think there's a real feeling that we have to figure out a way to democratize really these private assets. Any of us who got in this business, for us, as a mutual fund business, why did mutual funds get created? Because there was a period in the '20s where only the rich people could go to the equity markets and people said, ""That's not fair, that's bad."" What we're seeing is similar type of thing with the alternative space where private equity's only available for qualified investors and real estate investments are only really available for credited investors. And so, I think people are looking for vehicles that help us to access that because there's a real genuine fear about the retail consumer tying themselves up in a ill liquid asset without understanding the nature of that risk. I am a big believer that the 401K plan is a great way to do that in kind of managed accounts because you could allocate a percentage of professional manager and allocated a percentage to have information around your demographics and they have a lending facility. If the person really hits a hardship, it's already built into that mechanism. Patrick: Your mention of the Sovereign Wealth Fund and kind of this whole discussion brings to mind the nature of your client so with $1.6 or whatever trillion of assets, I'm sure you have a client in strategies of literally every type from the biggest Sovereign Wealth Fund to the tiniest individual, how has the nature of that mass, that client base and its composition, changed across your career? What are the relevant trends, you think, in how capital has pooled and becomes your client? Jenny: Franklin's history was much deeper on the retail side, Legg Mason was much deeper on the institutional side and so now we're 50/50 but I do think that what happened is the institutional side became more sophisticated earlier on really getting under the covers of risk and understanding attribution of portfolio returns and the retail side sort of followed along to wander. Nowadays, it's a very sophisticated process. Any retail consumer who's going through a platform where there's a gatekeeper who's analyzing it is getting the same type of professional review as any massive trillion dollar Sovereign Wealth Fund but that was an evolutionary process and then, as I mentioned, vehicles, I think vehicles are really more about the end client and what the end client wants to receive their capabilities and those differ depending on the type of client. Patrick: In the world of asset management today, what do you think is under discussed? What are we not talking about or thinking about enough, given the circumstances we have today or the opportunities for the future. Jenny: I'll tell you what I think is, again, back on this point of how do you democratize alternatives because of this really excess illiquidity premium that is received today in those private markets. You have that and a narrative around fees, fees, fees. If you're going to capture that excess illiquidity premium, and I'm saying it's excess because I think it's been really high for the category, and your first decision in selection is fees, there's a disconnect there. I don't think there's enough conversation about how we can get comfortable and you just take a 401k plan. If you're an investment committee, you don't get in trouble for going passive and going with fees. But you do get in trouble if you go with a higher fee product, because you genuinely believe you're going to get higher returns. Then either it doesn't quite return or people say, ""Well, you still picked too expensive a one."" So there's got to be some sort of reconciliation here between those two things. Patrick: It's so interesting how most markets have market clearing prices and in asset management, there seems to be just a couple fee models. The very best are two and 20. Others are still two and 20, even if they're not nearly as good. It's an interesting, strange feature and Renaissance is five and 50 or whatever they charge. The tail is the outlier. But it's a really interesting point.I'm curious as you look around, not just our industry, but just your peer set, who the other leaders are. It doesn't even need to be leaders, just other people that you've gotten to know that you've been the most in awe of. I'm very interested by this word ""awe,"" where you've seen somebody do something that just blew you away, and what you learned from it. Any episodes pop to mind with that word, awe? Jenny: Cathie Wood, what she built at Ark, just because I grew up watching my father build Franklin Templeton. I called Kathy one day and just introduced myself. I said, ""I just want to congratulate you."" I'm a daughter of an entrepreneur. My mother sewed the curtains at Franklin. We ate Spam once a week and drank powdered milk while my dad was scraping money away to invest in the business. I attended Franklin's first billion dollar party, which I was in college. The company was set up in 1954. So to build a business today in this mature industry from scratch, approaching a different model, I just have a lot of respect for what she's done now. She's hit the timing exactly right as far as the momentum growth opportunities, but there's a lot of people with similar growth and haven't been as successful as she has. Patrick: She's been incredibly audacious in every way, and I think catches a lot of flack for the degree of her audaciousness. What most specifically about the story is the most interesting? I've had her on the podcast, too. You can see why it's worked. You talk to her and back to P's at the beginning. She has the P's in spade. People may disagree with her investment decisions or her strategy. The scoreboard is that it's worked. Yeah, maybe say a bit more about how this has been possible for her. It does seem just like an insane ... Now that you look back, it's almost bewildering how fast it's grown. Jenny: I think she has a lot of risk in it. I do think that there's a big concentration in those big momentum stocks, but I think she knows how to capture a few trends. Social media trends, she's a dynamic speaker. Her approach to global research. I'm not sure I agree with everything, but it doesn't mean I don't respect how she's really done it. I think it's just been impressive and I have tremendous respect for her, as I said in building a business. Again, having seen somebody struggle to do it, it's never easy.",2153
289,Jenny Johnson - Seven Decades of Investing Expertise,Personal Progress," Patrick: How do you run a great board meeting? Jenny: Well, fortunately I don't have to, since my brother Greg is the chairman. To be honest, I actually think a really important thing is getting the right boardroom. That's having people with, again, this is putting together the right team. So it's diversity of views. It's some industry experience. It's external industry experience so that they can bring in learnings from other industries, a willingness to speak up, challenge the CEO, challenge the company's strategy, but also be supportive. There's the right balance between challenging and being supportive versus derailing a strategy. Then what's the board's number one job? It's picking the CEO. So you got to stay, make sure you're communicating well with the board and keeping them up to speed on everything. No surprises. Getting their advice. You want a board that you actually value the people's advice, which I do. Patrick: You've mentioned meetings a few times specific, not having meetings for meeting's sake. Daniel Ek at Spotify has said to me a few times that a lot of what he does is think about how to improve the quality of meetings since it's basically all he does, right? Just go from one to the next. So say a bit more beyond just the board meeting. Your brother's running that meeting, but the ones that you're running, what have you learned about running an effective meeting? There's a shockingly little amount about this in the world, given how much time we all spend on it. Jenny: First of all, know what your objective is. Why are you in the room? By the way, everybody in the room who is just listening, probably shouldn't be in the room. They should just get an update later. That's one. Everybody in the room should be contributing in some way. Then most importantly, no meetings after the meeting. You don't get to walk out and go start complaining about what you think was a dumb decision, that you didn't speak up. You shouldn't be in that meeting if you're not speaking up. So it's something I talk about a lot. There's no meetings after the meetings. We are going to have it out right here right now. I can be very strong and opinionated then. So sometimes I have to say, ""Jenny, don't speak up so much. Make sure you're hearing everything."" But I also expect my team of well-paid executives to speak up. Then whatever we decide, and sometimes as I said, sometimes I have to decide, you want them to support it going forward. Patrick: You gave a pretty specific percentage pie earlier of the ideal way to allocate your time. Beneath that pie, I'm sure there's tons of tactical strategies, decisions, whatever, that help you better manage your time, which of course is the ultimate resource. But what have you learned there just in general about managing your time as the leader of a public business, given that you have a general strategic framework that you already laid out? What have you gotten better at over time about just managing your time and your schedule? Jenny: The difference between even being president and then becoming CEO, it's amazing how many more people, when you become CEO, suddenly reach out. Patrick: Out then, yeah. Jenny: I was always so good about being pretty open door and trying to be responsive. You start to realize you just can't be that same accessibility as you used to be. So it's trying to prioritize what are the ones that you need to be doing right now. Patrick: Is there anything that stands out as the thing that usually puts something higher on the priority level then? How do you stack rank things? Jenny: There's no question. Clients, clients, clients. I think one of the most important things I can do, I'm not an investor by background. So I got to rely on those people and make sure they're doing the right thing. Then if any way, I can be helpful at communicating with clients and let's face it. That's where you learn where the trends are. It's what's on the client's minds that's going to inform you where your business should be going. So that always gets first priority. Patrick: If you were to take your own personal highest abstraction version of purpose, one of those four original P's, what does that mean to you? What are you trying to do? What matters to you? Jenny: Literally, if you think about what we do as a business, we are helping people solve the most important goals in their lives. So what are those goals? Well, okay. Retirement's an obvious line. We all talk about retirement. That's fine. How about helping your kids get a college education? Making sure they are not going to sit there for the next 20 years when they graduate, trying to pay themselves their debt. So being able to add to that. Or you have a special needs child and you are fearful about there not being enough money to take care of that child when you're gone. The realities of people's lives. Or you worry about having suddenly an illness that impacts you are a family member and the overwhelming medical bills that can come with something like that. Thinking about how you're one, setting up yourself from a financial insurance and other things out of medical, but also having to be able to supplement your income, to make sure you have enough prepared for those emergencies. That's what drives me every day. These are real concerns for people. Can they buy a house? That's an American dream, I think still, even though we said the millennials did not do it, but I think they're starting to, is to buy a house. That's a really important milestone for people. That's what we do every day is we come in and we try to create products that are and communicate appropriately, carry that responsibility every day of trying to do what's right. Patrick: How do we penetrate deeper to make that idea of, I think, the upward mobility and the goal achievement that investing unlocks? The data is the data. Investing in equities or 60/40 portfolio has been a phenomenal way to achieve everything you just described. But obviously there's a whole category of people that never get on that train. That seems like a huge problem, too. What do you think about that? Have you seen progress? What we do? Jenny: Yeah. So here is where I think this gamification cuts both ways. So first of all, if you, from age 25 to 35, those 10 years put away, let's say $5,000 a year, whatever the number is, and you get a 7% return, you will have more money than the person who puts away for 30 years from age 35 to 65 and gets a 7% return. Just think of that. How do we get 25-year-olds and 20-year-olds to start saving just so that the compounding effect will help them on the retirement? So I think if there's anything we can do, it's getting people to start investing earlier. That's where I look at some of these things, where you have the fintechs that round out the purchase and put some money in savings and whatever it is to engage people, whether it's in gamification. Just because once they start looking at it and start to see the compounding, then you get excited and about what it can be. I think that's a huge area of opportunity for the industry is figuring out how to get people earlier. Patrick: I so struggle with this because I literally wrote a book called Millennial Money, that was all about young people investing earlier in the power of it many years ago. It did fine, but it certainly was no best seller. The logic of the message was right, but it's not exciting. Meanwhile, Robinhood launches. Say what you will about Robinhood, but the fact is a lot more young people own stocks as a result. It is a paradox for me that I don't think it's the right way to invest, but it's hard to argue with the on ramp that it represents. Jenny: That's exactly right. What you hope is that you could pivot them once they're in. Here's the problem that my dad used to say this about. I remember at the peak of the dot com bubble, somebody asked him what his biggest worry was. He said, ""If the market tanks and turns down, you lose investors forever. They don't understand why, and they stay out of the market forever."" He had used the example of the Nifty 50, which was the pharmaceutical similar type of rocket ship of an equity market for pharmaceutical companies. Then they blew up. So when you see things like this Game Stop and where everybody piles in to support one stock, you have the unification of this, you do worry that as people get in late, and then they lose too much of their savings, they realize, ""Oh, wow, I don't actually get this."" So you worry about the burn side of it. So at least with Robo, you're getting some amount of structure around that. But you do hope that over time, it's much more about financial planning and thinking about what are my individual goals. Patrick: What are the other favorite things that your dad has taught you? Jenny: Persistence, persistence, persistence. He's got the Calvin Coolidge quote about persistence and his attitude of never giving up is the difference between success and failure. Patrick: How would you describe him to others beyond persistence? What adjectives would you use? Jenny: Let me say, my father has always said, ""Take care of the client, and the business takes care of itself."" He has meant it through and through. I think you find that anywhere you go in Franklin Templeton, that that was kind of the top down. My father is one of the kindest, most understanding people. You'd walk by him on the street and you'd never know him. He's just genuinely a kind person who every year, he'll ... Family has some season tickets to the San Francisco giants, he makes sure that he's got this shoe shine guy, getting him his tickets to the game. He's just very thoughtful and a good man. Patrick: What are the benefits of being understated? That's not an adjective I would use to describe some of our most famous people these days. Jenny: I don't know if it's a benefit one way or the other. I think having somebody who recognizes that every ... At Franklin Templeton, we talk about this. Every employee carries the brand on their shoulders. So think about, Patrick, some time where you had a bad experience, when you called in to return a shirt that you bought or whatever. You were so frustrated and you said, ""That company stinks."" That one person, you don't even know if they had a bad day. That one person carries that. I think my father recognized that and treats every employee and has taught all of us, my brothers, me, all my siblings who work here, the management within the company, that we are a people business and everybody matters, who's part of this business and everybody carries the legacy of the firm on their shoulders. Patrick: Wonderful sentiment. What about the future? Has you most excited? That's intentionally a vague question. Doesn't need to be within the business. It can be within the business. What has you most excited about the future? Jenny: Well, I have five kids, so I'm really hoping that one day I get grandchildren. But there's nothing happening there. Patrick: Great answer. Jenny: So I guess that one so seems so far off. I can't think about that. It's a challenging time in the business. It's a crazy time in the business. But it's an exciting time, too, if you got the resources we have at Franklin, what I think is the right set of capabilities for this next decade. I'm just honored to be leading the company in this time. So I'm really, really fired up. Patrick: Change and opportunity go hand in hand. Not easy but full of opportunity. Well, Jenny, this has been so much fun. A total blast for me to hear about your personal history and lessons and everything we've talked about. I ask everybody the same traditional closing question. What is the kindest thing that anyone's ever done for you? Jenny: During the hardest times in my life, when friends reached out and just knew that you needed them there for you. I just have great friends that have been friends since high school and have been at the very difficult times, have always been there, supporting. I hope they would say the same to me, that Busy can't always be there, but boy, is there when you need her. Patrick: I'm going to write a book someday that categorizes all these answers. We've gotten 300 or something of them, and showing up is a major category, for sure. So, love the answer. Wonderful place to close. Jenny, thank you so much for your time.

290,Doug Colkitt - The Evolution of Markets,Introduction," Patrick: Our guest today is Doug Colkitt. Doug has spent his career searching for and trading inefficient markets, first at Citadel's high frequency trading group, then for himself and then as an operator building CrocSwap, a decentralized exchange, or DEX, designed to bring modern functionality to crypto markets, which is closer to what large traders have come to expect from a modern electronic market like the NASDAQ. My interest in market infrastructure has continued to grow since my great conversation with FTX founder, Sam Bankman-Fried.So my conversation with Doug covers the evolution of market and trading infrastructure. We unpack the trading stack as it exists today, dive into DeFi's innovations and explore the new category of single contract DEXs that Doug is creating. After learning so much from Doug about how markets function and how crypto markets should function, I became an investor in his new business by my venture capital firm, Positive Sum. Please enjoy this great conversation with Doug Colkitt.",215
291,Doug Colkitt - The Evolution of Markets,Doug's Background & The Trading Stack," Patrick: So, Doug, this is going to be a really unique episode. You've been one of the people that's taught me most about the world of market infrastructure and how important it is to functioning markets, but also how interesting it is to traders, investment strategies, crypto, which we're going to spend a lot of time on. I think because you've had a really unique personal history, it's probably the right place to start with just a thumbnail sketch of the major stops of your career up through this point because I want to lay out for the audience why you're the right person to talk about the evolution of markets and why this kind of emerging space is so interesting. Doug: Studied computer science and finance in school, and then out of school, I started working for a hedge fund, Citadel. Most people have heard of them. Patrick: Stealer of constitutions. Doug: Yeah. Maybe not the most popular nowadays, but definitely some of the smartest people out there. So I was really lucky to start my career there and learn from some of the best people in the industry. It was actually around 2008 when the financial crisis, everything was going to hell, including most of Citadel, but the one group there that was consistently making money, making a ton of money was the HFT group. So it was the space everyone wanted to be in, especially around that time. So I joined the HFT group there, initially working on what they call alpha signals, which was statistical modeling to predict where the market's going over the short term. Was at Citadel a few years and then left right around the flash crash. I decided just to go out on my own and see if I could build the whole stack myself. Originally, I was trading at the CME, trading the index futures and the bond futures for a while. That was pretty competitive. I decided, ""Okay, that's the most competitive area. Let see if I can get a toehold there. Then if I can trade that, I can trade anywhere.""Over time, just those markets kept getting more and more competitive. So for reference, I think at one point, I was the only actual individual, not a trading firm, who was authorized direct market access to the CME. Right? So you normally, to trade, you have to go through a broker and you go through everything. But the small subset of people, usually trading firms are authorized to directly enter their orders and do the exchange. There's a whole process to go through there, so you don't break the exchange. So at one point, I think I was the only individual. Then randomly connected with some people who were operating in Turkey. This was right after their market went fully electronic or modern electronic infrastructure. I met them just randomly online, but they were looking for someone on the quant side to help out, build there. So went in a partnership there. We were trading Turkish equities. I don't know anything about Turkey. So I'd trade these stocks. I wouldn't even know what the symbols were. I said the other day, I just found out some symbol that was one of their most profitable. I always thought it was a soccer team or a football club. Turned out it was a steel company. But that's the nature of HFT, where you don't necessarily care about the underlying stocks, so much as you care about the market and price formation.So was in Turkey for a few years. Again, similar story, right? When they started being fully electronic, was very easy for one man show or a small team to make money. Then over time, things keep becoming more competitive. So you either have to say, ""Oh, we're going to consolidate or we're going to make big investments on the infrastructure to scale up."" So right around DeFi summer in summer of 2020, just very randomly read an article online about, and this was even before they called it MEV, or at least as far as I was aware, they weren't calling it MEV. So I thought that was interesting. I said, ""Let me just try making this as a hobby,"" and I did. Then the bot just, it started working pretty well. Was doing very, very well there for a while, putting more and more time into it and it took over everything. From summer 2020 until spring 2021, right around when these new generation of DEXes come out, just for reference, the way DEXes work is, or at least in the Ethereum spaces, they use this automated market maker system, which is instead of having active traders on the full order book that you'd see in a traditional market, liquidity providers put in their capital, put in a whole bunch of capital in each side. Then they just have the simple algorithm that balances on adjust the price to keep supply and demand in line. Simple mechanism, but works, especially in constraint blockchain.This next generation of Uniswap introduces this concept of concentrated liquidity. Instead of just putting it in your capital and forgetting it, you put in your capital, but you set the price range that you want to trade at. As you can imagine, this starts looking a lot more like a limit order book. It's not quite the same, but you have this concept. Okay, I'm putting in a price, putting an order at a certain price, and then I'm a liquidity provider. Maybe I change that price around. The one thing that you're missing in traditional AMMs is liquidity providers aren't contributing price discovery, whereas in NASDAQ or something, liquidity providers are one of the most active participants in the price discovery process. So I'm looking at this and thinking, ""Hey, this is actually very similar to something I know about. I know how that process unfolds."" So I look at that and then decide, ""Well, maybe I think there's a lot of advances there, but I think there's actually opportunity to improve on the model."" That's when I start my project CrocSwap at the time, and have been working on that ever since, and then hopefully, will be out pretty soon and people will be able to use it. Patrick: It's such a cool history. The right place to go from here is to discuss what I'll call the past, present, and future of, I think you called it the stack. I'd love to introduce some basic concepts and then build on those things to really hopefully have people that are less familiar with some of these topics, walk away, able to understand what is going on in the world of HFT, liquidity, provision market makers. These are terms that everyone's heard, but I don't think really understands what's going on under the hood.So maybe you could begin by just describing what you mean by a stack. Let's go all the way to the most matured. I go inside of jump or some very sophisticated HFT market making firm that's trading modern electronic markets. What is literally happening inside those firms? Why are they contributing to price discovery? I want to talk about the limit order book here as a technology. I want to talk about their infrastructure. Just give us a sense of the most mature, what they look like today. Doug: If somebody really wants to understand this field on intuitive level, I always say is, start with ... I don't know if you've ever seen those shows about pawn shops. All the same concepts that apply on those pawn shops shows, it's the same concept. At any given time, some people want to buy, and some people want to sell. But most people, they just want to buy right now or they want to sell right now. They don't want to come in and wait around. That introduces this whole concept. You need a market maker. You need somebody who's willing to stand in there, be willing to buy when people want to sell, and visa versa.If I'm running a pawn shop, they're always low balling. People come in and they low ball them. They don't pay the full value. They have to pay a little bit less than full value. That's because a number of reasons. Number one, after they buy it, they have to go put it in their inventory. They have to go put it in the back room and wait until somebody sells it. So that costs capital, and that's risk, where you have to commit that. You have to pay the overhead, all your employees in the store and everything for that process. People don't come into the store to sell the best stuff. They're just selling junk. People are always giving you their worst stuff and giving you your low ball offers.So market maker world, we call that toxicity. So you say, okay, people are trying to trade against you, but mostly they're probably trying to trade against you in the wrong direction. If there's bad news on, say, Microsoft tomorrow, there's going to be a big rush to sell Microsoft. So if you're just the market maker, put your orders out there. If that happens, probably your buy orders are going to get filled a lot sooner than your sell orders. So all of a sudden, you're sitting on a bunch of shares of Microsoft, and Microsoft is going down.So market makers also have to be very aware of what's going on, on a macro level, but more even so, on a micro level. What they're basically doing is they're looking at the market on a very low level and saying, ""Okay, there's way too much flow this way. That doesn't look like a normal market. I need to adjust my quotes. I need to get paid more because there's more risk for that."" So because of that, you have to build up a very complex infrastructure, always be watching every market something's trading on, generating, all signals and to predict where things are going.So I always go back to the pawn shop analogy, that somebody comes in, they want to sell something weird. The pawn shop guy's calling up 100 different people. He always knows somebody how to value baseball cards. So same thing. Market makers have to build up this infrastructure to value things, but more importantly to detect when markets are moving. It's obviously very easy if markets aren't moving to, ""Okay, let me buy at $10 and sell at $11."" That's theoretically an easy business. But the problem is if you buy at $10 and the market moves down and you have to sell at $9, then you lose money.So look at a big trading firm. They're hiring a lot of very quantitative people to number one, build the infrastructure, build the technology. The technology has to be very reliable. It has to be fast because they're also competing with each other in the sense that there might be an opportunity out there or they want to compete to get their quotes out before other people do, because there's also, you get priority as your quotes get entered faster. So that's a whole other game, in terms of that. You hear about high frequency traders are always obsessed with latency and shaving off microseconds or nanoseconds, just because exchanges give you higher priority for the sooner you get your order into the exchange. So they have to build that.They also have to build these quantitative models to trade something and predict where stocks are going on a very short term, because generally, these firms don't keep big inventories. They're mostly in the business of balancing out order flow on one minute to 10 minutes. They don't want to take a huge position at the end of the day, because that's not their business. There may be other people who will step in at that, but they're mostly there to turn over their portfolio very fast, and that keeps their exposure to longer term trends down. But they're very good at looking at the limit order book and the order flow to predict where things are going. Patrick: The limit order book question for just a minute, I think it'll be an interesting one to explore whether or not that's the end all/be all of market technology. But just to dig in a little bit more, if I was coming to this for the first time, I might have the question, ""Geez, this sounds like a really risky proposition that without real deep knowledge of, let's say, Microsoft in this case."" You're Turkey example, right? Doug: Yeah. Patrick: That was a sports team and it was a steel company, right? Knowing the businesses that are being traded is actually not that relevant. Actively, these firms may not have a view or really an understanding even of the businesses. So it sounds quite risky. Yet many of the best HFT firms, their sharp ratio, or however you want to measure, is incredibly high. Doug: You never have losing days. Patrick: They never have a losing day. Just explain how that's possible in a little bit more detail. Is it the quantitative signals, the infrastructure, a combination of the two?Why is it such a reliable money-making model? I guess, obviously what are the returns to scale? Because if it was this easy, everyone would do it. Doug: Say you have a coin and say it's a bias coin. So it comes up 51% of the time or heads 51% of the time, tails 49% of the time. If you just flipped it one time, you wouldn't bet that much money on it. You have a small edge, but you could lose very easily. So you're not going to bet a huge amount of money on that. But now, let's say instead of flipping it one time, we flip it 10,000 times and we say whoever gets their side, gets more win. So if I'm flipping a coin 10,000 times, I have a 51% edge, even though your edge on any individual flip is small, you're going to win this bet with very, very high probability. So when you look at a firm and you say, ""Okay, how do they make money every single trading day?""The answer is they're not making money on every single trade. They're making money on 51% of their trades, but doing 10,000, 100,000 trades a day. Statistically, the law of large numbers says that, okay, it's going to be very predictable when you execute at that size. So obviously, that's how things work when things are going well. The problem is it's not easy to get to the point where you have 51%. The one nice thing about HFT is in traditional asset management, you could have a strategy and you could think, ""Okay, we're making money."" Then over time, it might take months, might take years until you realize, ""Oh, we're not doing as well as we thought we would."" HFT, you can turn it on, and you'll say, ""Okay."" Patrick: A week later. Doug: Yeah, 30 minutes. ""Okay, this doesn't work. I got to turn it off."" So it's definitely not a case that you're guaranteed to make money because there's a whole risk to build up the infrastructure. I have to build these models, and knock them out in a half hour. You're investing a lot in building up the company and the infrastructure and the models. It's definitely hard to get to the point where you're profitable at all. But once you are profitable, you're probably profitable every day just because you're making so many trades over time, and that averages up. Patrick: So let's talk about that 51%. So what are the things at the cutting edge and the traditional mature markets that people are doing. You don't have to name super specific proprietary things or anything like that, but what is the nature of the models, the sorts of data, the sorts of features, the sorts of labels in these studies that lead to that 51 percentage? Where might that come from for one of the firms that's able to achieve it? Doug: The one misconception is that all HFTs are market makers or liquidity providers, and that's actually not true. Actually, some of the most profitable HFT strategies are quite the opposite, liquidity takers. What that means is just going back to the example, at any given point in the market, there's a bid which is the best price you can sell at if you want to sell immediately, the best resting buy order and ask which is the best price you can buy at immediately, the lowest resting sell order. Liquidity providers are putting their orders out there and letting them sit, and people are coming in and trading against them. So one basic way to make money is to do that.Put your orders out there, wait for people to buy low, sell high, be patient for people to come in and balance your inventory that way. That's what we call at making or liquidity providing. But a lot of HFT firms actually make their money, they immediately cross the spread. So they're going in. They're actually paying that premium to trade right away. That almost seems counterintuitive. Why would that make money over time? But what they're doing when they're building statistical models and they're looking at differences. So the simplest one you can imagine is they're the S&P index futures. They trade in Chicago, right? Then there's New York Stock Exchange, the NASDAQ. That's in New York. That's where the actual stocks inside the S&P 500 trade.So if you have a very fast connection to Chicago, the index futures are much more liquid. The stocks tend to move along with them, right? You can watch those index futures. When the price on those futures move, those contracts move, you can use that to say, ""Let me go buy up a bunch of stocks right now, before they go up."" Oftentimes, firms that are willing to cross the spread can make a lot of money, sometimes even more money, than firms that are market making it. There are other things. Sometimes those firms get not necessarily vilified, but people don't give them as much respect because they say, ""Okay, market makers are providing liquidity. What are these firms doing?"" But often, they're contributing to this price discovery process. Patrick: When you went to rebuild the full stack by yourself, what are the pieces of that? So what are the literal mechanical parts of infrastructure? How do you classify them? Doug: Our code base and maybe 100,000 lines of code or whatever. The actual strategy side, the glamorous side of it is maybe 10% of it. Maybe 15% of it. There's a ton of work that just goes on getting the data feeds, right? The data feeds from the exchanges are not optimized to be easy to consume. They're optimized to be fast, but you have to listen to the exchange. You miss a message, there's a whole process to regenerate, and it's bad. You don't want to do that. Make sure you integrate all the messages, build limit order book and your representations fast, obviously, the strategy that we talked about.Even just simple things, almost that you think are dumb can actually be fiendishly complex. So going back to it, you might be putting your orders and interface with the strategy, the exchange gateway and say, ""Okay, here's my order. Let me put it out there and process it."" Then you have to keep track of it. You might put your order in. But one thing that's actually pretty hard to do is you put your order in, and then your order comes through that data feed. It doesn't tell you, ""Oh, these orders belong to you"" and just that- Patrick: This one's your order. Doug: Yeah. So you might get in. ""Okay, I'm responding. Oh, this guy's bidding at the same price as me and maybe he got in before me. So I'm going to bid up. Maybe you get into a dumb feedback loop, trading against yourself. It's not that simple because sometimes the data feed comes in faster. Sometimes you get - because they're two different systems - sometimes you get the confirmation faster. So it's almost like a distributed systems problem from computer science. Some of these things are pretty hard to solve on because the way things are delivered, the order they're delivered in, isn't guaranteed at all. And these systems have been pushed to be so fast that oftentimes you have to make these decisions in a pretty high performant way. Patrick: So ultimately, it's about like so many data science problems. Some large chunk of the problem is getting the data, cleaning the data, handling it, speed, moving stuff around. And then like you said, only 10% or 15% of the actual code base might be the strategy itself. Doug: Yeah. The actual ideas. Even on the back testing it, it's not easy to build. But simulator for this, you almost have to build the entire exchange yourself so you can run it. Patrick: And what are the classes of data that matter in this world? There's order book data, there's price, there's volume. Mentioned many times like the abstraction that you could sort of think about the actual stocks with. Doug: At these horizons, there's not a ton of things you can actually look at. If I'm trading on a, like I said, maybe even if you're holding time as minutes, but really, or maybe you're holding time as even seconds, but a lot of your horizon comes within milliseconds, maybe 100 milliseconds of when you can very quickly ... Your trade has to move in the right way within like 100 milliseconds or you're probably not going to make money. At that frequency, there's not a ton of data you can look at. The news doesn't come out every 100 milliseconds and really not much happens every other 100 milliseconds.All that really happens at that frequency is orders come in, the book changes and other stocks move. So I'd say those three things. The order book, the order flow, which is the rate that orders are coming out and the price of other, not just stocks, other related security. So how other, if you're looking at Microsoft, you might want to see what's going on in Intel or vice versa. You have to get very creative in terms of how you drill those. Because those aren't simple numbers, just plug those into a spreadsheet. There's all kinds of ways to dice and measure those things. Patrick: And then finally, how do you think about returns in this style of, I won't call it investing. I'll call it trading. What is good returns? What are limits on capacity? What are limits on free cashflow from a strategy like this? What is great? Doug: Returns are going to be very high and they're almost irrelevant, whether your returns are 500% a year or 2000% a year, which might actually be something you'll see. But nobody's really going in and say, oh, I want 2000% a year instead of 500% a year. Because like you say, capacity constraints are by far the biggest limit. Right? You have sharp ratios, which are 30, crazy high sharp ratios. You're not optimizing for risk or capital. You're optimizing for, I have a team of, whatever, five, 10 people, and I need to make this much to pay them, put food on the table, pay for all my infrastructure. So really most people are thinking in terms of what are my revenue. Patrick: P & L? Doug: Yeah, exactly. P & L. It's like running a grocery store. The grocery stores aren't thinking about their sharp ratio. They're just thinking about, oh, this is how much business we're doing a day. This is how much revenue. This is how much we need to pay our fixed costs. So, in that sense, it's actually of kind of more prosaic than a lot of other strategies. Patrick: And what is that capacity? Just thumb in the air? How much do you think like the industry print and revenue or free cash flow? Pick your metric. Doug: It depends to what you classify as HFT, right, because you can start going out longer horizons and the capacity increases, but so does the risk and then you're back in the traditional putting on risk. I'd say probably in the US, probably this year is actually better, but maybe a few billion a year for US equities. And then if you want to go out longer, right? You could look at something like Renaissance medallion, which isn't necessarily HFP. But I think starts getting somewhere in between like what I'll call StatArb, which is longer term HFT and maybe a little bit longer horizon, but obviously the returns are very consistent over time. And they might do over $5 billion, just one fund. So depending how you define it, it could be anywhere from $2 to $20 billion, I guess. It's kind of a big range.",5506
292,Doug Colkitt - The Evolution of Markets,Market Making & AMMs," Patrick: I'd love now to hear your thoughts, just riffing a little bit on the importance of market making as I like a function in markets and the technology of the limit order book itself. You raised an interesting question one time, which was basically like, is this the final technology? Like is this the best underlying piece of infrastructure that drives markets that we can think of? Or might there be a different way of doing this? And so I'd love you just to riff on the pros and cons, I guess, of the limit order book as a technology, sort of where it came from and what the future might hold. Doug: Well, you said actually in the beginning, it's pretty interesting. What is the benefit of market making? What's the benefit of liquidity? And a lot of people criticize locally why are all these rocket scientists working for trading firms? They could be curing restless leg syndrome instead, or something like that. Liquidity is important because I have some security and I want to go to sell it, going back to it. If I want to sell it to you, right, and there's not a agreed upon price, it's pretty hard for us to do that deal if there's no kind of market, because you don't know, okay, what does this guy know that I don't know, what's like a normal size. Is this like a weird trade? If somebody calls you at 2:00 PM and wants to sell you a million shares of Microsoft, you say, okay. Somebody calls you at 2:00 in the morning and wants to sell you a million shares of Microsoft, you say, okay. I don't know. That seems kind of sketchy. I don't know if I want to be on the other side of that function because there is no market open and kind of doing something weird.Liquidity is important, right, because it kind of generates this continuous price over time. And even if you're not using it, it's important to have it so that like anyone could just look at the market and say, okay, this is the fair price. There's kind of this ongoing price discovery that happens. And when that breaks, that's kind of a hard thing to restore, which is actually you look in the markets, in the mornings, when they open, liquidity is always a lot less. It's always a lot more expensive to trade. Prices move. So people have debated 24/7 markets or not. In terms of the limit order book, I think it's been a very successful technology and it's been very good. And before it, just sort of context, it used to be this dealer system and you call up some guy at Nice and he has the whole thing just on his book or whatever. It depends on the market. But it wasn't very transparent. And I think there was a lot of opportunities for it. Not necessarily shenanigans, but people didn't necessarily see what was going on.One of the biggest advances with the limit order book, it's very transparent. Here are all the orders. Everyone can see them. If you put it in, you'll get matched against in this priority. We define it ahead of time. And obviously it's a very elegant technology. It matches people in real time. It's exceedingly solvable. The biggest challenge to it today is going back to these automated market maker systems. And they're not perfect, but one thing they've done very, very well on is less liquid, longer tail of assets. So we were talking about HFT firms and it's very high touch operation. And so you look at the stock market today, most of the volumes and the very, very biggest themes and small caps are very thinly traded just because nobody wants to deal with the headache of running a strategy and some name that might only trade like a few times a day is just too much to kind of maintain. The limit order book there, maintain all your quotes, adjust them.So one of the nice thing of about, and it made it very automatic. So you don't have to have professional liquidity providers. People can just put their money in and there's this mechanism that automatically balances things and for things that might only trade a couple times a day. I think it's been a very successful mechanism. Now, I think limit order books are still better for things that are liquid, but kind of a lesson there where liquidity that isn't professional democratic access to liquidity providing is pretty useful in certain cases and something to be thought of. And maybe the problem with limit ordered books is they kind of lock out somebody who just wants to come in and say, I want to provide liquidity. I'm willing to buy when people want to sell, I'm willing to sell when people want to buy, but I don't have 10 million to go set up a trading firm in Chicago. I want to put $10,000 instead. And maybe I don't want 30 sharp returns, but maybe one sharp returns to do that. Right? Because I'm willing to step in.So there's really no kind of on ramp for somebody who wants to do something like that. And even in very liquid markets, you can see this because the problems we have with moderate systems is right, you have flash crashes where things work very, very well until, going back to all these HFP firms, they don't hold huge inventory. So when they get completely filled in one direction, there's no quotes left and nobody's invested in the infrastructure to quote automatically. So they're huge profit opportunities, but nobody's stepping in and putting prices back in line to just because access is so undemocratic to that strategy. Patrick: Maybe talk through the literal mechanics of automated market making. If it is an innovation that improves on the limit order book, at least in certain parts of the market, I think it's worth spending a minute understanding literally what is happening. So I think limit order book is self explanatory, right? It's a matching engine, orders go in, they're intelligently matched, like you said, with a pre-defined rule set. So it's like, I'll call it like a very fair system. And all it relies upon is that the orders going in are not, I guess there could be problems with those. They could be spoofed. They could be something wrong with that. Maybe that's worth spending a minute on. But let's use that to contrast against what literally is going on inside of an AMM. So just walk us through this new technology, the literal mechanics. Doug: A very classical AMM. This was actually Vitalik, the founder of Ethereum. He just kind of made up a blog post and came up with this whole mechanism, just brilliant guy. Okay. Here's just the mechanism, someone go build it. And then they did and was successful. So the mechanics are classical system, very simple. It's what's called a constant product curve and it's a pair. So, let's just think euros and dollars. So think, okay, Microsoft trades, but really Microsoft trades is a pair against dollars. So sometimes it's easier to think in terms of a pair or 4x because that's we have euros and we have dollars and there's always an equal amount of value between the two in the pool. So just say for now, one Euro equals $1. So we put in a 1000 euros, we put in a $1000, they're equal value and we have an equal amount.And then let's say you come in and you say, I want to convert $100 to euros. So what you're going to do is you go to the pool, tell the pool, okay, here's a $100. The pool's going to try to balance that. The pool's going to determine how many euros can I give you and it's going to try to balance that. So the pool's going to give you about 100 euros back because they're about equal value. That's fair, but it's going to give you actually a few less euros back. I don't know. You can do the math and balance it out. But at the end of the day, right, the pool's going to have about $1,100 in it and 900 euros because you put your $100 in it. Now there's 900 euros left and now the prices changed and because there's more dollars and fewer euros, that means the price of euros has gone up in that ratio.It's a very simple mechanism where the price is just adjusting based on the ratio of the assets in it and it's always just keeping that product the same. Where that falls down is it's not that capital efficient. And you can think of something where maybe the price doesn't deviate too much. Like I think of say dollars against something that's almost always equal to a dollar. The problem is you have to put in equal amounts of both sides. It has to be able to support any price from zero to infinity, but maybe the thing you trade only trades between 99 cents to a dollar or right there are these kind of dollar ""stable coins."" And theoretically they're always pegged to a dollar. So if you have $2 stable coins trading against each other, it's kind of inefficient to put all this capital in there from zero to infinity because the price is probably never going to step outside of this narrow boundary. Patrick: So if I'm a liquidity provider in an AMM, going to keep referring back to kind of your examples that you've given to have some continuity here. I'm the person with $10,000, not the $10 million I need in Chicago. Doug: Right. Patrick: And I want to go earn, almost feels like a yield, on that $10,000 by contributing. Let's say it's a Ether Bitcoin pair, just to bridge into the crypto world a little bit here. I've got Bitcoin. I'm willing to put Bitcoin into this pool. And what you're saying is it's capital inefficient, because if it's the full curve, because I'm just sort of blindly putting, I don't know, 10 Bitcoin in there or something. And then I'm the liquidity provider and the price is handled for me. If someone wants to trade, they will want Bitcoin and they have Ether and they want to do a trade. Just sort of doing it on my behalf and giving me some benefit. Doug: Yeah. You can think of one as doing it on your behalf. It would probably be easier conceptual way is that you contribute to the pool and then you own some Pro rata share of the pool and then that pool's going to accumulate. Like you mentioned, I actually forgot to mention the original example, right? The AMMs charge usually a fixed percent. So they have some fee. So when someone comes into trade, they get that, but they also pay a percentage fee on top of that. And that might be somewhere, let's just say with 0.1%. So you also pay fee to trade and that's exactly what you're alluding to. Right? You earn a yield because as a contributor of capital to that pool, you receive your Pro rata share of the fees that the pool generates.Now, on the other side, it's the same problem a traditional market maker faces. You're always trading in the direction that people don't want to trade on it. Going back to that Bitcoin Ether thing, if the price of Bitcoin is rising relative to Ether, that means traders are going to be coming in, buying Bitcoin out of the pool, putting Ether into the pool. So the pool's always rebalancing in the wrong direction. So people have kind of worked out the math with this, but the function instead of having a linear exposure to the underlying assets, a square root exposure. So the price of Bitcoin quadruples, right? You might only get 2 X that return, but exchange, you're getting this yield on your capital in the pool. Patrick: Sorry for all the questions poking and prodding at this new way. I do think it's important because so much of the decentralized exchanges in crypto are automated market making systems. If this becomes, then obviously we're going to talk about what you're building in a minute here, with CrocSwap. But if this becomes a dominant technology for trading digital assets, the way it works matters.So if I'm putting the, same example, the 10 Bitcoin, into the pool. Is a way of thinking about this, that this is sort of just decentralized inventory contribution. We're just relying on, rather than a single firm, we're just sort of gathering all the necessary inventory to do these pair trades. And like in your early example, there's a bid, there's an ask and there's a spread and the market maker is providing liquidity in that spread. So therefore, we're sort of just doing the same thing, but the inventory is just coming from a lot of different places. Doug: Yeah. That's definitely a component of it. Because obviously if I'm trading Bitcoin to get Ethereum rate, there has to be Ethereum there for me. Part of what you're getting compensated for is exactly what you said. I have this, I'm providing it to people, this inventory, to people who are willing to get it. But I don't want to overlook the price discovery impact here. Because if you go to markets, most of the trades, crypto markets or traditional markets, most of the trading at any given time isn't trading because people actually like need that asset. We could look at the CME people trading oil. Most of those people trading oil futures are not actually going to be taking delivery of oil in 30 days. They're there basically to express a view on the price. Crypto markets, you can kind of see these perpetuals, which are kind of analogous to futures, have taken over a lot of the market share and there's no delivery there. There's no way to express view on the price.So the other way to think about it, I think, is that the LPs are betting that the price won't deviate too much between the two, because the LPs are sitting there. And as long as the price, some people call it impermanent, what I described before, how you can move and then you're always kind of moving on the wrong side. Some people call that impermanent loss because in an AMM context, as long as the price comes back to the original price, you won't lose anything. And some people think maybe that's not a great marketing term because maybe it hides the fact that yeah, you could lose out on that if it doesn't move back. But we'll call it impermanent loss or IL. In some sense, if I'm a liquidity provider in AMM, I'm short IL. I'm betting that the price isn't going to deviate too much or the ratio between these assets. So Bitcoin won't deviate too much from Ethereum in terms of the ratio of their price. So being an IL is kind of expressing a view in that sense. I think this price is stable. I'm betting on it being stable. It really is relative to how many other people are betting on.",3251
293,Doug Colkitt - The Evolution of Markets,Evolution of AMMs," Patrick: So now we can talk about the evolution or iteration of the technology of DEXs as you see it. I know you left, you had this experience with trading Turkish equities. There was an opportunity there. You were enticed back by the DeFi opportunity as a trader first, trying to make P & L for yourself, and building a lot of infrastructure to accomplish that. But then you sort of shifted your interest towards being an infrastructure builder or supplier provider, or however you want to talk about it, because you saw an opportunity to improve on some of the state of these decentralized exchanges that are fueling so much of the volume of the crypto world.So before we get to CrocSwap and the ways in which you and I have talked about this really cool category name for what you've created, which we're calling single contract decentralized exchange or decks. I want to understand exactly what that means. But first just walk us through what have been the evolutions of AMMs themself that are meaningful. So if it started as this capital inefficient, zero to infinity price, talk about what's happened since and who originated AMM in the first place. You mentioned Vitalik, but who commercialized it with the greatest success or what are the big players out there and how have they gotten better through time? Doug: After Vitalik threw out the idea, the first AMM was Uniswap. Hayden Adams from Uniswap. I think the legend is he kind of read that blog post, said, oh, let me just put that together. And then Uniswap was born. And it's really hard to overstate the growth rate in this category. So even like a year ago, the whole space is grown probably more than 1000% in just the past year or so. Going back to like the beginning of 2020, this was a very, very niche field. So you had a lot of different protocols, but to be honest, right, it wasn't a huge amount in a volume. So to have Uniswap and they pioneered and a lot of people said, ah, this will never work. Nobody will use it. And they kind of showed, yeah, actually people will use it. There's actually a lot of demand, especially what we talked about, that long tail of ... Patrick: Stuff not on Coinbase. Doug: Exactly. Because traditionally you came up with a token, right? You have to get listed by Coinbase or Binance or whatever. And until you do, you actually have very little liquidity and started to buy it, it's hard to sell it. So it was kind of revolutionary in the sense that what Uniswap did and this whole space did, is permissionless. So you don't have to go to Uniswap and get approved to list your token. You can just go create your own pool. You just interact with the protocol and nobody's going to stop you. So I think that was pretty revolutionary and drove a lot of growth. And then in 2020, the space kind of starts exploding. Number of protocols. They came along but one of the big ones is Curve and going back to it. They were, I think, the first people to tackle this capital inefficiency problem and Curve very narrowly focuses on, I want to say narrow, but this is obviously a huge segment of the market.They focus on payers where the price is stable. So like for example, you have USD Key and USDC, which are both pegged to $1. Putting the full curve on that doesn't really make much sense. So Curve use is kind of a different method. Same idea, the same curve, but it kind of pretends, oh, we have more capital than we do, but that's fine because the price never deviates too much. So it's much more efficient in terms of you don't need as much capital to support trading. So Curve has been very successful in the space. I think they kind of showed that there's ways to iterate on this core idea. Obviously, in the Solana space, it's kind of a different blockchain. So people have innovated there and give them a lot of credit in terms of Solana blockchain itself has a lot higher throughput than Ethereum, so in Solana you can stand up full limit order books, and they actually have full limit order books running on that blockchain. But the problem is you're not interfacing with Ethereum where maybe 90, 95% of the organic user activity is, but I think they innovated a lot in showing, Hey, you can actually run full order books in a DeFi context that will work as well.I'd state Uniswap V3 itself, Uniswap kind of innovated on themselves, so you got to give them a lot of credit for that. What is pretty revolutionary... And Uniswap V3 isn't necessarily an automated market maker anymore because there is a lot more complexity in this concentrated liquidity idea where instead of providing liquidity from zero to infinity, I'm going to pick my price. So I'm going to provide liquidity from 80 cents to $1.20 or whatever, right? And I only have to contribute capital to cover that range, and then theoretically I'll gain all the fees in that range, but if it goes outside that range... I think people are still trying to figure out that model. I think we have to build better tooling, but I'm pretty bullish on concentrated liquidity in terms of, I think price discovery is better, and I think ultimately liquidity will be better than the classical AMF for a lot of cases. Maybe not necessarily for the less liquid cases, but for a lot of the more liquid cases. Patrick: How do you think that crypto market participants that are not infrastructure builders that could never dream of building a DEX, but nonetheless are interested in DeFi and maybe being a liquidity provider should think about this? Like this maybe is where we could talk for a minute about the amount of assets that are in these protocols. We could talk about staking and the returns to staking. What is the perspective of the asset holder that wants to be involved in this system? What do you think they should expect? How should they approach all these protocols and tools? Doug: I guess I'd preface it that there's probably a huge range. When you say that it could be anyone from someone from 500 bucks that they want to earn some money onto multi-billion dollar hedge funds. And the whole range is actually in the space now, for sure. I think most people are probably approaching it as a income yield product and you're thinking, okay, I'm in crypto, I have these assets and I want to generate a yield on them. And most of it's understanding the risk factors to staking, and kind of what we talked about before with IL, and what are you exposed to and what do your cash flows look like.So I think that's probably the first thing because a lot of people take the simplistic view, ""Okay. Here, let me just look at my APYs, my yields on like every single pool,"" but some of the pools come with more risk on different sides than other pools. So I think ultimately there's going to be better tooling and better frameworks, but there's probably major room for improvement in the pace. Just kind of translating, better communicating, maybe coming up with more of a common language than just, oh, the yield is here, the yield is that, but papering over some of the IL issues I think this space could improve on a lot. Patrick: When we think about the function of a protocol like a Uniswap, that's fully decentralized and permissionless, Uniswap has a native token. And I think one of the things to always ask about crypto protocols is the relationship between the job being done and the native token of the protocol. I'm just using Uniswap because it's the most well known example. What is the function of a native token for a decentralized exchange protocol? Why does that need to exist? Doug: Native token is almost shares in the company. Just go back, NASDAQ. There's NASDAQ the exchange, but there's also NASDAQ the stock. The stock itself trades on NASDAQ the exchange. So same thing, there's Uniswap the protocol, and then there's Uniswap the token. The Uniswap the token also trades on Uniswap the DEX protocol. So basically these native tokens behave almost the same way that stock in a company would behave. They're almost like equity in the protocol. So number one, they entitle you to revenue generated by the protocol. Most of them do, some are revenue list, but most of these protocols, a certain percent of the fees generated go to the token owners and like any other company, that's the cash flow. That's the cash flow series, discounted cash flow. You can model that. The other thing is they give you governance. A lot of these tokens will have certain parameters that you can change around.For example, Uniswap has different fee tiers. So you're allowed to create a pool with a 0.3% fee. There's a pool with a 0.05% fee, and just the other day, they voted on a pool with a 0.01% fee. That was a vote by the token holders. So somebody created a proposal and then anyone who held Uniswap tokens could vote on the proposal, and then it was approved. Now the protocol supports 0.01% fee. So you can also think those are like governance rights in stock. You can vote for board members. Where that gets interesting though is DeFi is... It takes finance and then does a bunch of crazy stuff on top. Where it gets interesting is sometimes certain cases, people have created tokens that strip the voting rights away from the cash flow, right? So people will sell those. And Curve is an example of this.So Curve will give out rewards inside it with its native token and so support certain pools over other pools. So if you're a token and you want to get a lot of liquidity, obviously it helps it, Curve boost your rewards on top of that. Now there's this whole market where people stripped out voting rights on Curve token, and they're selling those. And then new tokens are buying those to get their tokens supported on Curve, but then you're still getting the income on it. So there's all kinds of iterations of that game being played in DeFi world, which is kind of interesting, kind of fun. Patrick: I think it's fascinating, right? It's like live experimentation of the speed of crypto in terms of governance and organization of capital. What do you think about the ways in which someone can earn, let's say a Uniswap token, a UNI token? Just maybe enumerate the ways that you could do it. Obviously, you could buy it on Uniswap itself. How do the tokens originally get distributed and are there ways to earn them without just buying them in a market and holding them because they're associated with some yield? Doug: When people create these tokens, whatever the original team, the original investors, some are allocated to them, like any startup. Mark Zuckerberg has a certain per cent of Facebook shares or whatever. Generally, these tokens are community. So you don't want to understake how important community is in the DeFi space. People like using protocols that they culturally associate with. So generally these protocols try to decentralize, which means getting their tokens out to a community of people who really believe in the project and want to be attached to it and have some sense of ownership over it. So we were talking about Uniswap, specifically the way they got their community-owned tokens out to the market was they did something called an airdrop. So basically they didn't actually have a token up until last fall, but to anyone who used Uniswap prior to that, or in a certain way, they basically looked up...The nice thing about the blockchain, everything's transparent. You can see all the addresses that have used Uniswap. They went through before and said, ""Okay, these are all our users up to this date."" Without previously announcing it, all of a sudden, every one of those users had so many Uniswap airdrop tokens in their address when they woke up the next morning. And I think you can look up, it's over 10,000. A lot of money because some of these people are just small traders and then got these big airdrops. So it was kind of a nice benefit for them. So there's airdrops and that's I think the most classical way. Uniswap did not, but most protocols now do something called liquidity mining rewards. And that's basically where they have a special incentive program where somebody is staking liquidity or using the protocol in somewhere contributing capital protocol, contributing liquidity, and going back, we were talking about fees and not only are you receiving fees generated from the exchange, but you're also receiving native tokens for providing liquidity.So it'd almost be like if I was a market maker at NASDAQ and every day I made a market, NASDAQ gave me X number of NASDAQ shares for making the market that day, I guess would be the closest analogy. Another fun example in this space was something called a vampire attack that SushiSwap... So SushiSwap is kind of a competitor to Uniswap and they got very big, very quick because they did something called the vampire attack and this was last fall. They cloned Uniswap. So it said, ""We're the same functionality as Uniswap. Come use us. If you move your liquidity from Uniswap to SushiSwap on this date, you'll get a huge number of SushiSwap tokens,"" and overnight they stole almost 50% of Uniswap's market share with that scheme. Uniswap didn't have a token before then, and that's actually kind of what kicked them into high gear and did the airdrops. So all kinds of politics there. Patrick: I just love these little details. So let's imagine that Uniswap did have one of these reward programs. If I'm a liquidity provider on Uniswap, I've provided Bitcoin, let's say to a pool, how am I receiving my fees? So let's just say, it's one of those pools that has the 0.01% fee or whatever on trading. Am I receiving that in Bitcoin and ETH something else? Like what is the actual way that I'm receiving payment for my service, for my provision of liquidity? Doug: You're providing capital in that pool, and then that pool is collecting the trading fees. It depends. The old V2 is slightly different than the V3, but basically there's a pot of trading fees that accumulate over time. And then the mechanism will say, okay, you entered the pool whatever today. And you exited it a week later, and this was like the accumulated rewards rate when you started, and this was the accumulative rewards rate when you ended, so here's the net rewards over the time that you were active. And so here's your pro rata share from contributing that. Patrick: And which currency are those calculated or they're received in? Doug: These pools actually give you the option. I can pay in Ethereum, or I can pay in Bitcoin. So the pools will accumulate rewards on both sides, depending how the traders... That might also be a different thing, right? It'd almost be like if you were trading Microsoft on NASDAQ and NASDAQ, you obviously pay your fees in dollars, but it'd almost be like, if I could pay my fees in Microsoft shares. Trade a million Microsoft shares, I pay my... Here's five Microsoft shares. So you can accumulate rewards on both sides of the [payers/pairs] . And then every liquidity mining program's different, but it will say something. If you were providing liquidity over this period, you'll get X number of Uniswap tokens for every X units of liquidity you provide it for ever long, and then you just multiply that out, and they say, ""Okay, you put in here, you took out here. We also owe you these number of Uniswap tokens for contributing to the pool."" Patrick: And then the way that the cash flow associated with holding a UNI token works is what? Just on some interval, I have a right to some part of their overall revenue or something? Doug: UNI has actually not technically turned on their protocol fee yet. It's built into the code and they will turn it on, but they technically haven't turned it on yet. But so you go back, there's a 0.3% pool. So let's say you come in as a trader and you want to convert, to make the math simple, one Eth equals one Bitcoin. So here's a hundred Eth, give me my Bitcoin, and I'll pay the fee in Bitcoin. So you put in a hundred Eth, you get a hundred Bitcoin back, but you're going to also pay a fee in Bitcoin. So really you get 99.7 Bitcoin back. So the pool keeps 0.3%, 0.3 Bitcoin for itself. So of that, some fraction goes to the liquidity providers in the pool. So it's usually one six is the take rate. 0.25 Bitcoin will go to reward the people in the pool, and 0.05 Bitcoin will go to quote unquote protocol fees, and those protocol fees are basically profits for the UNI stakeholders. And then that will accumulate to a treasury, and then either that can be paid out like a dividend, or it can be reinvested into all kinds of things like any company.",3884
294,Doug Colkitt - The Evolution of Markets,Single Contract DEX," Patrick: Fascinating. Okay. We have done an incredible amount of setup to get to a new category, which we're calling single contract DEX. And I'd just love to hear how you think about this category, why you've gone to the effort to build a new decentralized exchange with all this unique knowledge that you bring to the table. So what was so interesting to me when I met you was this deep background in HFT and market making in the most mature electronic markets. Maybe one of the first things you said to me was, ""Look, like in five years, I would expect that the DEX world feels to a big sophisticated market maker like NASDAQ does. What if we can be a part of that transition?"" So just talk me through at a high level, what CrocSwap is going to do and do differently than others. And then we'll get into this idea of a single contract DEX, which obviously implies that other DEX are not single contract, why that's important and what it unlocks. Doug: Number one, I think concentrated liquidity is the future and because of all kinds of reasons, it's a lot more advantageous. So the first thing CrocSwap wants to enable is take that change with concentrated liquidity and push it further, and what does that mean? Number one, I think things need to be a lot more frictionless. So I don't think we talked about this, but on the blockchain, take any type of action. There's what's called quote unquote gas fees, which are basically the blockchain itself will... They're not paid to UNI. They're not paid to liquidity providers. They're paid to the minors or eventually the validators, but to include data or action, Ethereum's like a computer, right? So to do any type of action on - Patrick: Like a database. A ledger, yeah. Doug: Yeah, exactly. It's like a database and to do action on the database, like same as like AWS, you pay to take action. So as demand for Ethereum has gone up, unfortunately the gas fees have gone up and people are working on scale and solutions, but they're never going to be free. It's always going to cost money to take any action. One of the issues with concentrated liquidity is the gas fees unfortunately have been pretty high. And I think that's kind of hurt this idea of active price discovery. AMMs have kind of worked in this very high cost gas environment because you put in your liquidity, you set it, you forget it, you come back a year later, and maybe the gas fees aren't too bad because you're only doing it once. Right? But let's think of like what a high frequency trader looks like in a traditional market. Literally you might cancel 99% of your orders, so that means to do one trade, I have to do a hundred different actions, a hundred different transactions.If something looks like that, I have to do a hundred different transactions on the blockchain if I want something that really looks like high frequency trading, so that's incongruous with high gas fees. So one thing we're trying to build CrocSwap is to make it much easier for what a high frequency trader would look when they're quoting something like this. And you might look at, okay, I do want to put in a range order, I do have some view on the price, but I want to be able to change that pretty quickly. And so I need to be able to change the price. And also maybe I need to be able to change my fee tier.And that's almost like widening the spread or narrowing the spread because when you look, like the pools have different fee tiers, you might say, ""Okay, I want the lowest fee tier when I think the price isn't going to move a bunch because I'm just going to be collecting a bunch, but I want a higher fee tier because I want to get paid more because I think the price might move a lot more in the next 30 minutes or whatever. So I need to be compensated more for my liquidity.""A high frequency trader would be looking at something like this and I'm saying, how can I make this active? How can I move things around a lot? And unfortunately the current DEXs either don't support concentrated liquidity, or if they do and you try to do it, there's all kinds of frictions that exist at kind of this active liquidity provider. So CrocSwap is basically taking those frictions away from a number of different angles. But first and foremost, going to this idea of a single contract DEX, I think is very important because taking a step back as far as I know, every DEX is... Every pool is a different smart contract.The problem with that is if I want to move anything from... And say, going back to the example, I want to move from the Bitcoin Eth but instead of being at 0.3% fee tier, I want to be at 0.05% fee tier. To change my quote, I actually have to take my liquidity out of the higher pool, burn my position, take it out. All those tokens come back to me. That constitutes a lot of gas costs to transfer those tokens. Then I have to go and transfer those tokens to the other pool. And I'm paying a bunch of gas to move there. In a high frequency world, that'd just be very simple. Narrow the spread, widen the spread. You can do that a hundred times a second. That's a very heavyweight operation for something that should be a lightweight operation.With single contract DEX you don't need to do that because pools themselves live on the same contract. So there's still internal data structures that track those pools, but luckily the single contract DEX can just say, okay, this is how much, net out the position. So you can execute this long string, arbitrarily long string of actions and narrow the positions at the end. That significantly lowers the frictions to kind of that active liquidity provider. Patrick: I think it's both gas fees and also even something like taxes. Doug: Yeah. Every time you do any of these transactions, another example is, just talking about the liquidity provider side, but let's even just say... Or even on that side, right? Every time you do one of those things, that creates a taxable event because technically the tokens go from the pool back to you and then back to another pool. And you technically have to realize that creates a taxable event. And then that potentially creates all kinds of downstream tax effects if you were holding the tokens somewhere else. Another example I always use is oftentimes when you're trading from say X to Y, there's not a pool between X and Y.There's usually a pool between X and Eth, and Eth and Y. So in anything, you may say, ""Okay, trade token X, give me Eth, I'll send the Eth back, and then give me token Y."" Okay. But now you're receiving Eth from the pool, which has nothing to do with your trade. You just want to convert X to Y. I'm sending Eth back. You have a taxable event in Eth because there's an up and down transfer to your address, and if you were holding Eth in your investment account somewhere else, you have to realize the profit on that if you're using first in by full accounting. So that creates all of these deleterious tax effects and as more institutions get into it, that's obviously going to be a bigger issue. So in terms of avoiding frictions on that side, is also undervalued. Patrick: What made this possible? It just seems so obvious that if you could have every payer and sort of, like you said, any arbitrary, new thing you wanted to do in a DEX all happen in a single contract and therefore pay way less in gas and pay way less in tax, it seems like the obvious way to do it. So why didn't others do it this way? And how are you able to do it? Doug: A lot of pain and suffering basically in the engineering to get it there. Ethereum basically imposes a limit on how big any single contract can be and that's to keep the blockchain healthy. There's all kinds of reasons you can talk about, but long story short, Ethereum imposes kind of this limit on... A smart contract's basically a program that exists on the blockchain. So you can't make the program, you can't make the smart contract bigger than this size. So it says like 24 kilobytes. So I always want to say, there's a story like the original developers, like super Mario on the original Nintendo, and they were trying to fit all their code in, and actually some of the level code apparently was also program code. So they're trying to make their program code also appear as like blocks or turtles or whatever. But I always want to say, I want to find those guys and hire them, because I'm sure they'd be great Ethereum developers, just a lot of engineering.And that's where it's kind of been... Going back, when I was doing MEV trading because that's obviously, you kind of compete on gas usage there, and you're kind of trying to push the limits of Ethereum engineering. So used a number of tricks from there and even actually in general, in high frequency trading... So one thing that employed on CrocSwap is this concept of the hot path and the cold path. And that actually comes from high frequency trading because when you're engineering things to be very low latency, you want to think very carefully about, okay, this is what I do 99% of the time. So if I can make this 10% faster at the cost of making the 1% case two times slower, that's a great trade off to make. So I think you kind of just have to understand the entire stack from bottom to top to know what are the trade offs I can make and whether these trade offs are worth it or not. Patrick: What is the impact of all this? What do you estimate the improvement or reduction, I guess, in friction will be as a result of this single everything happening in one contract and improving on the way the DEXs work today? What will it mean for its users? Doug: For the trader side, in terms of the gas cost, 10 to 20% lower, and actually we can get up to 25% lower fees on that. Because with a single contract DEX, also the cool thing you can do is you can hold your collateral directly at the DEX. So going back to if I actually need the Ethereum out, I can take it out. But if I'm just there to engage in price discovery, I want to trade Bitcoin against Ethereum and I'd want to do 30 trades a day, 300 trades a day. There's no reason for me to keep sending these tokens back and forth to me. I can just say, ""Hey, totally exchange. Can you hold the balance for me? Don't bother transferring the tokens. I'll take the tokens out at the end of the day. We'll settle up.""Which is kind of how markets work. When I trade Microsoft on NASDAQ, Microsoft doesn't go in and out. Just NASDAQ, we settle up at the end of the day. So, you can get 20 to 25% cheaper for active trading. But on the LP side, really excited because over 50% reduction on the gas fees and in some cases as much as 70% if we're talking about these, I want to move my quotes around. Patrick: Well, set aside taxes is yet another advantage for taxable traders and providers, but those are huge numbers. What impact do you think that has? Typically when you reduce frictions, it has non-linear impacts on behavior and activity in technology. Reduce 50%, you don't expect double the activity, it's something way, way larger than that. So, do you think of the liquidity providers as your customer and that it just so happens that because of this much more efficient way of building this thing, that traders also benefit? Doug: Everybody's really a customer. One of the things of building a market, it's an ecosystem, right? And you can't just say, ""Oh, I'm only going to deliver on this part of the ecosystem because ... Am I going to do institutions? Am I going to do retail trading?"" While the reality is, if you only have retail trading, you're not going to have any liquidity because retail people aren't great at providing liquidity and if you only have institutions, two trading firms don't want to trade against each other all day. They want to trade against retail. So, you really need both sides of it. I do think there will be a pretty substantial change in behavior. One of the problems with Uni V3 is that people aren't moving these positions around and what happens is the positions go out of range and then they forget about it and a week later ...Actually, people think about, ""Oh, okay, the position's out of range. I can just forget about it."" But well, really you can't because you're still exposed to that toxicity effect we talked about before, right? If I put in a limit order, even if it's away, market moves through me, I can get filled in the wrong direction. So, it's been a problem in terms of just because it's so expensive to move. Once you put these orders in, it's so expensive to move them around, that people have had a pretty bad user experience and no one's using it in the active price discovery way that I think people were originally hoping that they would. I think this reduces those frictions. Patrick: And how do you think about some of the other ancillary things that we've talked about? Like native token, for example. Do you think that that is the right model where there's a Croc token that gives its holders some rights, some incentive to be better participants or spread the word about the exchange? You said it's an ecosystem, a market's an ecosystem, how do you cultivate that ecosystem using the tools in your toolkit? Doug: I think the token is definitely the right model. Markets and network, the value of a network scales with the size of a network. So, let's say something like Facebook. Why is Facebook? Well, it has good technology, but it's valuable because I go to Facebook. All my friends are on Facebook. So going back, how much value did the first participants in Facebook add to that company? Well, probably pretty substantial when you think about it because the fact is they got them from zero to 10,000, a million, whatever. That's a huge increase. So, I think native token rewards for your early users align incentives because they are building that network and I think that's the right approach to take. Patrick: And what's next for CrocSwap? What do you think are the most interesting decisions to make potential improvements even to your own system? You mentioned Uniswap has already improved up over time. Doug: The way I see the single contract Dex is this is the beginning, but I see it as a foundation for improving the technology over time. And it really unlocks a lot of things. A lot of potential that is a lot harder to do in the older architecture. For example, once you have a single contract Dex, all the collateral in the exchange is at a single point. So, one thing that DeFi has not caught up to on the centralized exchanges is trading on margin, trading with leverage, perpetuals. And I think the centralized exchanges have shown there's huge demand to trade with margin.That's hard to do in a DeFi context, largely because the capital is all over the place in 10,000 different contracts. But once you have a single contract Dex, all the capitals at a single place. So, I think it becomes a lot easier to add that technology on top and margin people, and more importantly, cross margin people between markets. And that becomes pretty critical for price efficiency, because there are a lot of specialized traders who, they might use a lot of leverage, but it's not that risky because they're shorting one asset and going long another asset, but they're very correlated. So, they might be using a lot of capital to bring those two things back in line, but they're not taking that much risk. So, it makes sense for the market to enable them to lever up those positions and increase efficiency that way.",3607
295,Doug Colkitt - The Evolution of Markets,DeFi's Promise," Patrick: If we abstract away just from these individual decentralized protocols, just to DeFi more broadly, someone that's been such a deep participant in it, how do you think about its promise? Where do you think this all goes over the next five, 10 years? We've talked mostly about infrastructure and how markets function and how they work. We haven't talked much about the things that are actually being traded. I'm just curious, obviously of a history of maybe caring less about what the assets are and more how the market works and how things are connected, but if you step back and look at the promise of DeFi, what do you see? If you think forward five years, what's exciting about what might happen in this ecosystem? Doug: To be honest, I think right now it's obviously just crypto assets. We're talking about Bitcoin and Ethereum, but to be honest, I think five, 10 years, there's going to start being real assets start trading on DeFi. And there's no reason it's not, right? There's no reason a stock can't tokenize or at least a portion of its stock and make that into a Tesla. There's no reason we can't have a Tesla token that could trade on CrocSwap the same as any other token. I think it has a number of advantages. The most basic one is just being a globally integrated. Anyone who has a blockchain can access it. There's not barriers across the globe. So, it makes it very easy to access global capital markets. So, I think of something like Turkey, right? If I told you, ""Oh this stock in Turkey is really hot. Everyone I know there says, oh it's going to explode."" Would you go to Turkey and open a brokerage account? No, you'd never do that. You'd never do that in a million years.So, especially for middle income countries like that, assets that are out of the way, hard to access, does it necessarily make sense for them to have their own segmented market and run the Borsa Istanbul and deal with all the headaches there? Or does it make sense, let's just tokenize our assets and access the global capital markets? So, one thing I think blockchains are, like any technology, you can look back, but the scalability doubles, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months. So, it's a lot like Moore's law that way. Every computer capacity keeps doubling every two months, bandwidth. Stuff like that often seems like a toy at the beginning. It's like a stupid little toy, we can't run anything. With that kind of exponential improvement, it's not very long until it starts replacing the legacy systems. Patrick: What do you think about this as a major threat to NASDAQ and to Nice and to all the other centralized exchanges in crypto, what are the things that might survive this? How do you think the existing players will evolve to match it? What is a better product? Let's just assume all the protections were in place, which is a big assumption I know in crypto world, but let's assume that there was a world in which that was the case. It's hard to argue that capital formation of markets shouldn't be global and 24/7, which obviously decentralized exchanges would bring. So, how do you think NASDAQ, Nice, you've dealt with these institutions a lot in your career, how do you think they'll react? Doug: I don't think necessarily it's they have to survive or die. I think you're going to start seeing a lot more technology where DeFi markets can integrate on centralized markets. So, another thing we didn't talk about with CrocSwap is we have technology in place where we can create sponsored pools where it would be some pool that can be created with arbitrary permissions to use the pool, but we'll always have the permissionless pools, but we can also create theoretically sponsored pools where, okay, some … Let's say Binance comes in, right? And Binance says, ""We want to access DeFi liquidity."" But obviously that's hard to do in the current context, because they can put out in a quote, but they can go to trade against Uniswap and the price might move. But CrocSwap has concept of sponsored pools where Binance can create a Binance pool subject to the approval of the CrocSwap token holders.And they can say, ""Okay, if you want to provide liquidity in the finance pool, you can do that."" And because it's on the blockchain, it's very transparent over time. This is how much you're earning. This is how much Binance is giving you, this is whether Binance is pushing you over or not."" Binance knows, okay, we can access that liquidity in a permissioned way so we can show those quotes on the Binance exchange. So, if somebody wants to trade, they don't necessarily have to go to CrocSwap, they don't even necessarily have to have their own wallet. They can go to Binance and then access that liquidity and then Binance transparently accesses that liquidity on the back end.So, cool thing about DeFi is people call it Lego blocks for money. So, it's very composable and I think that's been one of the biggest advantages of the ecosystem as people focused, how do we compose systems rather than one system trying take over, exclude everything else. So, I think the centralized exchanges will find that the technology for them to interface into those liquidity pools on different ways will keep expanding and it'll be an opportunity for those that are open to it. Patrick: What about NASDAQ? Doug: NASDAQ. There's this whole system in the US called Reg NMS where already this exists, where, okay, if there's a better quote at Nice and NASDAQ's trading it, then NASDAQ has to route your quote to Nice and it makes sure everyone gets like the best quote available. There's no reason you can't have a DeFi exchange that's also eligible for protected quote status, talking about the future. Patrick: One thing we haven't talked about in the world of crypto is this concept of MEV, which is an acronym now that seems to kind of be everywhere, but probably most people have no idea what the hell it means. Something to do with the order in which you're going to get filled or participate in a blockchain. Maybe just describe what MEV is and why it's an important concept and how it might fit into this overall ecosystem of DeFi and Dexes, and as you have been doing so nicely, relate it back to some of the points that we've made before. Doug: There's a blockchain and traditionally in the network, I create a transaction, propagate that transaction out to everyone in the network, and then minors or validators are actually building the chain, building the blocks on the chain and they have leeway to decide how do I want to construct the next block? So, traditionally when you think back, okay, this is Bitcoin, I'm sending money from Doug to Patrick, and that doesn't necessarily matter too much if the next transfer is reinserted. But with DeFi, we started building more complex systems where minor changes in the order of how transactions are included in the history have huge effects on the profit or trading strategies or anything else. So it's funny, MEV actually stands for Miner Extractable Value.The miners themselves weren't actually participating in it for a while. It was basically traders who know the miners are very predictable. We always include the highest gas cost thing first and then if there's a tie, we include whatever we see first. How I got into it, where, okay, I'm a trader and I can put out a trade and I know the miner will include it a certain way and then I can get a profit advantage and that might be something. Okay, a big trade's coming in and I want to trade in front of that. Someone's going to buy a ton of Bitcoin, right? Obviously I want trade at the lower price before he pushes the price up. Or it might also be something like, oh, the price is going to dislocate on this one Dex. So I know, okay, this guy's going to push up the price of this Dex and the other Dex is going to have a cheap price. So, let me go buy a Dex B and sell a Dex A and lock in a street profit.So, there are a number of strategies, but it's the idea of if I'm very good at getting my trade in the right way, then that's a profit opportunity. It ties in pretty nicely with HFT. HFTs are always specializing in, ""Oh, I got to be very fast. Execute with very, very high precision."" And when you go to Robinhood or whatever, you don't exactly care about the precise ... We want to get a good feel, but exact details don't matter. So, I think of them both as strategies where people who invest a lot in very, very high precision of how their trades or their transactions are executed earn these outsized profits.So, one of the problems, I think in terms of why each kind is so much, and maybe exists in the first place, is people come up with all kinds of crazy algorithms to prevent it. But to be honest, the user experience hasn't been great in preventing it. It's fairly easy for a lot of these Dexes to prevent people from getting front run or getting attacked, especially the type of MEV where they're losing value. But they're not really built into the front end or the application level, the interface level of the system. So, I think a lot of the way to fix it is build better systems on the front end to stop users from making bad decisions that can be exploited in the first place. Patrick: What other meaningful missing pieces of infrastructure are there in the DeFi world in your view today? Especially things that you aren't building or aren't interested in building. Where is the maturity really low and how might we address it? Doug: The biggest thing in DeFi that's where the demand exists is there's huge demand for stable coins. At the end of the day, people want dollar back. People want some something that behaves like a crypto asset. Very easy to transfer, very easy to hold, you can secure in a wall, but is pegged to one US dollar, isn't going to fluctuate up and down. Especially middle income countries, right? People want dollar assets in Brazil or Turkey or Nigeria. Don't necessarily have access to the dollar banking system. So, some of the more wild DeFi protocols basically exist to fill this demand for stable coin. There are custodial state coins like Tether or USDC where somebody is depositing money in a bank account and they issue of coin back.But then there's also this concept of algorithmic stable coins. And we have Dai, which is you deposit over collateralized and you deposit whatever collateral, and then you get back a dollar backed stable coin. There's a mechanism to keep it in line. People are getting into all kinds of crazy mechanisms to just get as many stable coins out there as possible and under collateralize things and things that might behave riskier. So, the biggest thing in the ecosystem is somehow just getting more stable coins out there. I don't even know. Maybe that's central bank, digital currency, but there's huge demand for it. And I think if that demand's not satisfied, people are going to keep doing riskier and riskier things to generate synthetic stable coins. Patrick: It sure seems to pretend what you said earlier, which is the demand or desire to have more traditional things on Blockchains. The reasons you want a dollar are not probably dissimilar to the reasons you might want to Tesla coin in your example earlier, I think that's something that's really interesting and something to head. If there's overwhelming demand for effectively a digital dollar, that's probably going to be demand for digital everything. All of a sudden that makes the addressable marketable for blockchains God knows how much bigger. I just find that fascinating. Doug: Right, right. I think you'll see more and more assets live on the blockchain or something similar will live on the blockchain. And if you don't give people some avenue to access those, they'll figure out another avenue and might not necessarily be the right way, or riskier, I guess. Patrick: I guess. Well, Doug, this has been so much fun. I've in the past, learned so much from what you're building, but also just your experience in the nitty gritty of market infrastructure. I had a conversation a little different than this one with Sam Bankmanfreed from FTX and the subject was kind of similar, the role that infrastructure plays in markets and why lower frictions are so important. And so really excited to see the work you're doing come to light and appreciate you educating us all on HFT and markets and exchanges and decentralized exchanges. I ask everyone the same traditional closing question. What is the kindest thing that anyone's ever done for you? Doug: I don't know if it would point to one particular thing, but my dad was always an entrepreneur growing up. And I think he's always encouraged me to go out and build something. Don't necessarily go along a path or just go along where someone else has built something and don't be afraid to try new stuff, take a risk. So, I definitely credit him for a lot of my journey. I don't know if it's necessarily been better, but it's definitely been a lot of fun. Patrick: I love it. Well, Doug, thank you so much for your time. Doug: Great.

Everyone's writing about it. Facebook changed their name to Meta. It seems like the next big trend in technology and consumer behavior. And we're very lucky to be able to discuss with you today. Probably the person that has most built a version of the metaverse in the past at huge scale, with lots of interaction and tons of lessons.The motivation for this conversation today with you and Bill is really to explore not just what you learned, but also how those lessons might be applied to this very exciting, but yet to be proven future of the metaverse. I think the right place to begin is with an overview of what Second Life was itself. So maybe just give us the origin story of why you sought out to build it in the first place, when you did that. And we'll get into some of the bonafides of this world that you created. Philip: Thank you. Thanks for having me. Well, first, as people have talked about, Second Life, the origin story of it wasn't motivated as much by computer gaming as it was building and Lego kits. I was fascinated by the question of what would happen if people could build things together in a space, starting in darkness, starting with nothing. The thought that I had was, what if we could build a Lego set that was the rules of physics? Of course things like Minecraft today, fast-forward, look a lot like that question in ways.What if we could make some basic rules and some basic building blocks that would let people make things? And then also let them do that together in the same space and also built an economy on top of it so that they could, if they chose to, they could trade those things with each other. That was really the core idea of Second Life. And this was way before the idea of the VR headset or anything like that, or even really fancy 3D graphics.The enabling technology that I had to actually wait to start with was really broadband and just basic 3D on computers. 3D came to computers in a way that was generalized, right at about 1999. And the other thing that happened in that year was it became clear that broadband was useful and it was something that everybody was going to have in the next couple years. Patrick: I remember distinctly like being an expert on the GeForce cards back then. The polygon counts and like how quickly they were accelerating and how exciting that was for gaming. And I'm curious the scope that this got to. So we'll include some like cool screenshots, so people can get a sense for sort of the look and feel of this world, which you called the grid, but just talk us through like, how many people were in this thing at its peak? How did that scale and grow? What did the economy look like? Numbers around that I think would bring it to life. Philip: Yeah. And what's really interesting is I'm going to give you these numbers and numbers for today and the numbers for the biggest that we ever were. So it's about the same today. The world of Second Life today is really big. It's about a million people using it. It's a space that's about the size of Los Angeles. And that actually is meaningful because the space is, for the most part, one big space.You look at one map, you can click on somewhere and jump to another place. You can visit somebody's house and then go visit somebody else's. But the overall actual real estate of the space is about the size of Los Angeles. The economy is about $650 million a year in GDP transactions between individuals and the typical transaction, which I'm sure we'll come back to and talk about because it's so interesting, is a couple of dollars. So there's close to a billion dollars in transactions going on. And that number has been the same for more than the last 10 years, since from about 2008 on to now. Patrick: One of the big obsessive points that everyone has honed in on today is the ability to on and off ramp into other currencies within the virtual world, this is where crypto and Web 3 become very popular topics. How did that work in Second Life? Or how does it work? There's Linden dollars, which I think is the name of the currency on the grid or in the game. And then there's U.S. dollars. Like what is the face between those two things? Is there a consistent exchange rate? Designing an economy is hard. Like how's all that work? Philip: Yeah. I'm thinking of Bill at this moment. When Bill and I met, he had just, among other things, had deeply been exploring one of the world's first widely used digital currencies, which I mean, maybe Bill could explain a little bit about, but that was critical to our success as well. Patrick: Yeah. What was that story, Bill? Bill: Mitch Lasky and I had just spent a bunch of time in China learning what was going on there. Almost everything everyone's talking about, Philip and I talked about 15 years ago. And the economy, we had discussion after discussion. We made the decision collectively to keep it fixed, to your point of view, to keep the Linden dollar ratio fixed to the dollar. And that was achieved by actually increasing supply in that case.With the hindsight of everything that's happened in crypto, if you did it again, maybe you don't do that. Maybe you let it appreciate because it's such an attractor from an incentive standpoint, but that's what we did at the time. But it had the whole thing. It had all the pieces. It had 3D graphics. It had these building blocks and tools. We had massive entrepreneurism inside the platform. Tons of amazing creative work from the people involved. And if you include things, you'll see just unbelievable work that people put together in the striving economy.It's funny, I look back on it, it makes me smile with enthusiasm. But also knowing we didn't achieve what we hoped would be achievable. We read Snow Crash when it came out. It's so funny to hear people say, oh, you want to know about the metaverse? Just read Snow Crash or watch Ready Player One. We were excited about the same shit, it was just a long, long time ago. Philip: Another point there, as Bill says, is that what makes Second Life fascinating to look at as a study of what may happen, or I suppose what a lot of people hope will happen next in this space is that the value of those things people were making and selling to each other in Second Life. Indeed the very value of the currency as Bill said, were basically small and stable.So it was very different than the tulip bulb situation or the speculative investment situation that we have today with crypto. In Second Life, as Bill said, we actually increased the money supply as people came into the world. To keep that honest, we basically were openly traded against the dollar and the euro at prices that we couldn't control. We essentially made an early version of an exchange as we have today with so many crypto sites.But we had that exchange, and so the Linden dollar traded freely against the dollar, but, as Bill said, we increased the money supply by selling new currency into the market so that it remained steady. In addition to that, the value of things in the world was entirely or almost entirely in every case, driven by their real utility. So if you bought a baseball cap to wear around on your avatar in Second Life, you probably paid $2. Or if it was a designer one, you might have paid $20 or a hundred dollars, but you didn't pay 2.4 million for your profile picture. Which is clearly a different phenomenon, right? So it's fascinating that Second Life, the value of the things in there- Patrick: Was more real world tethered. Yeah. Philip: Yeah. It's tied to their real utility, which is really interesting. And it's almost like Second Life separates the speculation from the utility in a way that lets you study things. Patrick: What was the favorite example of entrepreneurship within the game? Give us an episode or an artist or builder or someone that was doing something that used this raw physics engine in this world to build something online that kind of feels like entrepreneurship digitally. Philip: There was a guy named StarX was his name, I remember the guy's name, and he used our scripting language. Again, this would be like shades of Ethereum virtual machine or Solidity today. He used our scripting language to build this thing called StarX's wand. And if your avatar was holding this wand in its hand, and you said something or somebody else said something, the wand would magically create these like ridiculous funny props that would go along with what you said.So if you said Santa Claus, I remember, Santa Claus and the reindeer would appear 20 feet away from both of you, and then fall to the ground and like shatter into pieces in this kind of horrific mess. So it was a very artistic product, this guy's magic wand. And it sold for, I think, and I'm laughing saying this, given where we are today with crypto, it sold for like $50 or something, but of course, many, many thousands of copies of it sold. And we were all like the idea that somebody would pay $50 for a thing made in a virtual world is so incredibly exciting and wonderful. It was evidence of this guy's capability as one entrepreneur. Patrick: I'm going to try to constantly like come with the argument of what I think the biggest metaverse crypto Web 3 maximalist would say in response to some of this. Well, this time it's different because of X, have you respond, because I do think some things are different open public ledger blockchains seem like a really interesting general purpose technology in search of use cases for end users. If we were to respect the new technology, what is the most different that you look at and think, geez, I wish we had that during Second Life? Another way of asking this is, was it a technology problem that was the rate limiter to success as you saw it back then that maybe some of these new technologies would address in a new metaverse? Philip: I mean, there's a couple of things stuck together in there. First, I mean, at a very high level, as a two letter answer, I think there are basic technology problems that keep all of us from wanting to go into what we're imagining or talking about here as a metaverse. There are technology challenges that are just as challenging today as they were then, that are going to block that, are going to make it challenging.However, I think some of the ideas that everybody is putting out there today like decentralization are very powerful ideas as it relates to how you would build such a thing. One of the points I used to make about this is the internet itself, websites themselves, I think reached their peak rate of growth in about 2012. And at that point, the number of new websites that were deployed per day was something like 300,000 a day.So if you really did want to build something like what people are saying with the word metaverse, that is a genuinely open construction that is the scale of the internet, you would have to be putting online, hundreds of thousands of new servers or something like that every day at some point. And so you need to build an architecture that would enable that many people to work in parallel to deploy that.The idea that it's going to be something that is both simultaneously can handle and is interesting to billions of people is built by one company that's pedaling the wheels on its bicycle as fast as it can while it puts machines online, I don't think that's a very likely outcome. I think it's much more likely that we have to use some kind of decentralized technology. Now having said that, I think, as we all know, the different pros and cons of where we are in crypto and to what extent that decentralization exists is we're right in the middle of it right now. And clearly everything is not landed at all in that area. Patrick: I want to come back to a lot of these lessons, the things that specifically worked and didn't work, and whether or not those things are going to be different in the future. But Bill, I'm curious, when you first approached this concept and this idea with Philip, what was it that was most exciting to you? What was the promise of it that got you so personally invested in asking all these same questions that we're now asking again 15 years later? What part of reality didn't line up with the excited potential that you saw at the beginning? Bill: In talking about this in retrospect, I worry a lot about my own bias to protect my own ego to say, is the concept have issues? Or did we just miss parts of it? Blatantly aware of that. As I mentioned, I got super excited. I had been to China. I had looked at what was starting to happen with WeChat and QQ, and I had read Snow Crash. And the minute I saw what Philip was doing and when in the world, it was everything. I had all the same enthusiasm Zuckerberg has right now.I'll probably get some of the timing wrong, but I think the company went from zero to 70 million in revenue in less than 18 months. And so you had this vision and excitement about what was possible. You had a founder that was way ahead of everybody else, new to exactly what he was doing. And then the revenue worked. And at that moment in time, that one moment in time, I thought this was going to the moon, but it didn't. A fair set of questions, and I'll give you a few of my simple thoughts, but then I think we should ask Phillip is why didn't it go to the moon?I think it's imperative to give credit to Minecraft and Roblox, which have done extremely well and were started shortly after we did. There's two elements of both of them that are worth mentioning. One, their primitives are simpler. And so the creator tools at Second Life, you could do amazing rich things, but they were a little harder to use. Well, three things. Two, the demographic focus of Minecraft and Roblox were both children. And we were not, we were the opposite actually, which is important. And then three, there were more gaming heuristics there. We truly were an open-ended creator universe. And so those are the things that I think about that were different from some of the things that got a lot bigger. What would you say, Philip? Philip: I think that distinction you just made about calling out Roblox and Minecraft is really useful and important to look at. I agree with you. Minecraft in particular used simpler primitives, so everybody could build. I've watched my kids when they were 10 and 12 using Minecraft and building the most incredible things. Reminded me of some of the amazing spaces that people built in Second Life, looking over my kid's shoulders, watching them do this, my daughter and my son, building different things, building together, but they were able to take advantage of these simpler primitives.But as Bill said, what's interesting about that, and an interesting challenge is that the simpler the primitives are, the more appealing they are to kids and not grownups. You've got this interesting trade-off. Graphical quality is the same thing. If you want to have, for example, work or dating or going to shows or things like that, you probably need a lot of graphical quality. If you want to have 10 year olds building stuff together, you don't need as much graphical quality. So there are these really interesting differences in these systems. But I think calling out Roblox and Minecraft as Bill did as the two, I think most important data points and projects to look at after Second Life is exactly right. Patrick: To me what's interesting, maybe to throw a third company into that conversation is Unity, which notoriously is also hard to work with. A kid can't pick up Unity and build a mobile game. It requires more expertise. I don't know how it would line up to the Second Life difficulty level or something. There's no grid in Unity. It's a creation tool. It's arming people to build whatever they want, not in a predefined space with a predefined economy. So is there something there that was off like the combination of it being like an actual space, the actual destination, plus the creation tool that just didn't quite have a big enough TAM? And maybe the question is what is the TAM of more complicated, not simple adults that want to create this stuff? Philip: Yes, I could answer that in part. First, the obvious thing which you said is Unity is a software development kit, not a product. And you could want it to be a product. As yet it is not. So it's a development kit. But I think the other interesting thing to say is, do we get to a metaverse by 10,000 different people using Unity, building some kind of a single experience and then connecting those experiences together?I deeply think that's one of the things we need to carefully consider. In short, I think the answer is no, we don't. I don't think if you were playing a game of Grand Theft Auto, and you could drive your car from Grand Theft Auto into Among Us, I don't think that game designers want that. I don't think the guy in the car wants that. Nobody wants that. Patrick: I can't take my Ferrari and put like a grid on the front and go mow down Among Us cartoon characters. Philip: I mean, Bill and I have seen that experience, the positive side of it, like the cases where people do more than anybody else. And so if we're saying that, you should listen to us. I mean, we did find the user stories in Second Life, where people do want that. And of course, there are tons of them. There's almost a billion dollars a year of those stories, but the simple idea of a world of worlds, or of a metaverse of games, I just don't think there's a there there. I don't think any of us want to do that. Bill: Yeah. This gets into something that I think is super important for the listeners, Patrick, which is, I'm going to be mentioning something that I learned from Philip. So maybe he can fill it out more after I say it. There's a version of what people call the metaverse, where we all jump into this 3D virtual world, with some representation of ourselves that is a avatar that we've all adorned. Our big learning was that there's a certain type of person that really enjoys doing that. And it's a form of escapism. Kids, they role play all the time, even before the internet. They do dress up, and they build little spaces and tents, and those kind of things. And so, it's very common for a child to want to do that.As we get older, it's less and less common to actually do that. And there's a question. And I think, once again, Phillip has some ideas on like the types of humans that really get a lot of psychological benefit and dopamine out of that type of escapism. It may be actually a small fraction of adults. Patrick: How would you put a number on it, Philip? How do you think about that market? Philip: That's really well put. I mean, I'd play that back and say that, for adults, what we learned to the negative in Second Life. Although, I mean, again, overall, there's kind of wanting to, like Bill said, you look at it with a smile, and then with, I guess, some regrets, but there's wanting to have made something that worked for four billion people, which is certainly what I said at the time, and I felt that we could do. And then there's a reality of it working incredibly well, and in a very hopeful, interesting way, in terms of looking at behavior and relationships and stuff, but for a much smaller group. People, like Bill said, he said it perfectly. Kids want to play with their identity.For example, they want to grow up, try what it's like to be 20 when they're 12. And that drives the appeal of a lot of experiences for kids. And we have to be careful, obviously, as to make those experiences good ones. But that desire is there from every kid.When you're a grownup, reasons why you would essentially give up your body and take on a new body in a virtual world are very different. And they're certainly not common. By the way, they're wide-ranging, to expand on what Bill said. You could live in an authoritarian regime, in which you were largely restricted in your ability to do whatever feels like a good life to you. You might be disabled in one way or another. You might be in a rural locale, as a creative artist or something, where you just don't have anywhere to do your thing and have people respond to it.But as Bill said, those things I just listed do not apply to all of us. If you're trying to build something top-down, like Facebook is saying it wants to do, that applies to all of us, there's a tremendous disconnect between what has worked so far, as demonstrated by Second Life and other systems, and what we would all fantasize would be a really big opportunity. Bill: And what Phillip just said was proven out in Second Life, when we would get to know these creators that really flourished inside of Second Life. They matched the type of profiles that Philip just went through. And look, I'm not the first person to make this statement that I'm about to make, which is, if you pay attention, Snow Crash and Ready Player One are both dystopian futures. So if you have a dystopia, there would obviously be a much larger percentage of the world that would get value out of role-playing in a virtual world. Philip: And if we don't have a prospective dystopia that really matches up to science fiction levels of quality right now, I don't know what else is COVID, right? We're looking down the barrel of possibility, where we all have to shift more of our social life online, even if we don't like that prospect. It could be thrust upon us. And that's a real world scenario that looks like these science fiction stories. I read something funny, to say what Bill said, somebody, I don't remember who said it, so I can't credit them, but I read a great quote the other day where they said something like, ""For God's sakes people, the metaverse was a warning, not an instruction manual.""",5082
298,"Bill Gurley, Philip Rosedale - Back to the Future","Defining The ""Metaverse"""," Patrick: I mean, the word reminds me of a funny comment my friend, Gabe Leydon, made to me, who ran Machine Zone, who I think is like a realistic, interesting person, when it comes especially to gaming, but also to the metaverse. And he said, ""Look, all the guys are building like the general purpose AIs, when they have conversations with me, like, ""We need you. We're going to need you to distract the masses when the AI takes over."" And it is a very dystopian, WALL-E-like feeling future. It begs the question, what the metaverse concept means to both of you today. It's one of these concepts onto which everyone is projecting tremendous excitement.My friend, Matt Ball has written extensively about this, I think, is sort of the canon that you should go read, if you're interested in diving deeper. But what does the word mean to you today? Is it the hype word? Is it a word filled with promise? What might it mean in reality, so we could point to something and say, ""Yes, that's the metaverse."" I'm just curious how each of you interprets the word itself today, in 2021. Philip: My piece to add to this is, I think, when you look at what's happening now, people are mixing together two pretty different ideas. And they're interesting to consider in isolation. One of them is the trend to go from 2D to 3D. People have talked for years about how certain types of information is better presented in 3D. The famous Memory Palace that we used to talk a lot about in Second Life, where if you see things on a wall in a virtual museum, you remember them better, and you actually remember even conversations that went on and stuff like that. So the transition from 2D to 3D, which is made vaguely possible by increases in computing power is like one thing.But then on the other side, and Bill, you've talked about this with me, on the other side of that, there's just the idea of moving the internet from being a largely lonely single player sort of experience to one where there are other people there all the time, where there's communication is kind of embedded in everything. That second one to me seems very separable. You don't need to do 2D or 3D to do that. In fact, and Bill and I were talking about this earlier, look at Discord as an example of a communicative metaverse. Definitely larger by the numbers in terms of people than anything that's yet been fielded. And I think that's a very interesting way of looking at it. So there's two ideas. 2D to 3D is separable from people being there all the time. Bill: That's almost identical to what I was going to say, Patrick. I was going to say that I think you need to really fork the metaverse into two separate concepts. One of them, as opposed to 3D, I might say avatar-centric. Then I went back last night, preparing for this and watched a couple of hours of Zuckerberg talking, and watching his demos. And most of what he's doing is that avatar-centric version, which is really what we built at Second Life.The separate fork, the other side of it is this idea of Digital Place. And can we meet and communicate? We're doing it right now, the three of us. We're all one step away digitally from everybody at any point in time. And can you aggregate people into online communities in realtime, and see wonderful things happen? I would even say, in the past week, it seems like Twitter Spaces is blowing up, at least for my communities.And I think that's a version of that type of connection, and it's audio-centric. It's not a 3D avatar, but because of the ground we've already covered, I'm very skeptical when I see Facebook show like a work scenario, that we're going to go do board meetings with avatars. And we've done them. Philip and I have done eight of those board meetings with avatars, and that was pre-Zoom. Now, you have a substitute that's a real competitor to that idea with Zoom. And Zoom will get better. That 3D avatar thing for adults, I'm very skeptical of this other world, this other concept of creating communities that connect live, and are maybe audio at first, and we'll grow from there. That's way more exciting to me. Patrick: Maybe we could just double click a bit on Discord, because one of my investors came to me and said, ""Look. If there's any launch platform for the internet or metaverse today, it's Discord. It should be like the place you start to then enter into experiences, because it's the place that aggregates the most seamlessly, the most people together around like a single topic or idea, or interest, or whatever."" As an investor, and I'm talking to Mitch about this too, what has Discord taught you about why this is a powerful concept, aggregating more people, synchronously, digitally? Bill: I'm going to share something. We all have our own stories that relate to personal experiences. But my middle son has grown up in this world, and played Minecraft, and has been in all of the multiplayer games, him and his friend cohort live on Discord. It is their starting point. And he's gone from high school now to college, and he's got friends all over the country. If they're going to hang out or get together or do something in this 3D universe, they start by meeting in Discord.It's almost like when I was 17, we'd meet at the boat ramp, and then we might go do something else. In that way, it really is that kickoff point for that community coming together. And then they go explore. I don't know that they need to take their Ferrari from one game they're going to play to the other. They're going to hop in one game, maybe play together, come out, chat some more, maybe talk about doing something different. Maybe talk about going in another place. But when you see them doing that, and once again, I'll contrast it with some of Facebook's video examples, they show you going in and looking at these screens, and saying, ""Oh, I'm going to go from here."" they show those transitional things. They're very awkward. That part doesn't need to be 3D. And I think Philip framed it right. It's about separating what's happening graphically from what's happening with human connectivity and communication. Philip: That's so well-put, Bill. I mean, this idea that you loiter together as, say, kids or young adults in a place, and then you decide what you're going to go do. I'd add the additional point here. That place is typically a public place, which is interesting. It's often a place that's broadly accessible. It's safe. It's kind of a safe ground where you start. We don't have that yet. And one of the opportunities, and then, I think Discord is the closest thing to it, but you can still look at that a bit more, and think about what needs to happen next.What is the simplest ground meeting place that is kind of a public commons that we can go to, maybe as adults as well, and as young adults, where we go off from there together, and what are the rules of engagement and to what degree, for example, do we need decentralization or whatever, to make that workable? Bill: I gave you an example of a young group of friends. Discord has already transitioned pretty broadly into shared common interests, and then moving into professional, especially in things like crypto. And so, you see organizations getting together in realtime around like a crypto project, in the exact same way I just described about my son with his friends, but with a corporate or a professional purpose in mind, using that space for collaboration and communication. That makes infinitely more sense than having a board meeting with a bunch of people in avatars, at least from my standpoint, in terms of how much scale could you get, how quickly and how impactful could it be to the actual progress of what's happening.And maybe crypto, because it's so new, and it's so distributed. As a side note, everyone that's learning about crypto should study open source, because in some ways, especially on the governance side, it's kind of an evolution, or like a 2.0 of what they did in open source, but you have these distributed communities trying to be productive. And so, that's a perfect example of someone that would want these new types of tools for the digital place. Patrick: Before we go, I want to spend like a chunk of time on some of these crypto things that are so exciting, because they're so poppy in terms of the numbers being eye-popping, and just like the excitement around them. And I'd love to hear both your impressions of them, but I don't want to leave this chance to talk a bit more about the 3D avatar technology, graphics part of the world, because it seems like if you take Minecraft, I think everyone's probably seen Minecraft. It couldn't be simpler-looking graphics. It's like these big pixel blocks, it's not visually appealing, but it's just incredibly malleable.It seems like almost graphics don't really matter. It seems like some of the limiting factors, like if you talk to experts on the metaverse, they'll say, to achieve everyone in high fidelity on one screen at one time, we need more bandwidth, we need cloud resources that evolve, we need Unreal Engine VII, or whatever it is. Just say a little bit about whether or not that is real. Are we really just waiting for technology to unlock more? Or is that really just like nice to have on top of something much more basic? Philip: I'll answer, hopefully in a funny way, hopefully not too cryptic way, which is to say that the challenge of the metaverse is that you have both chasm to cross, and the uncanny valley, if you want. If you're driving your startup motorcycle off the left hand side there, know that you have to actually get over both of those things. And what I mean by that is, if you are representing yourself as a player in a game, or as a Minecraft character, you don't care much about what nuance you're presenting as a person to the other person. You're using the avatar as a prop in a fun way, maybe an escapist way, like you're basically playing a character for a short period of time in a game. And even if your characters got expensive sunglasses that were an NFT you bought or whatever, that's all fine, but that's not at all the same thing as coming into a conference, or a classroom, or a bar, and presenting yourself with the intention of establishing a new relationship with the people that are in there.The rule for the latter is much more demanding. And indeed, I would say, technically, we haven't yet crossed it. It's kind of this uncanny valley problem. What Bill would want to adequately be able to walk into a board meeting, and fully participate in it, we do not yet have. What we need to be able to play a game that lasts for 10 minutes, with people we went to high school with. Yeah, sure. We have all that technology. Bill: I think it's a provocative question, and I think my personal view is it doesn't matter. I think there are many, many reasons why every hardware company, and every microprocessor company, wants to believe it matters, because it will sell a lot more of those things. But if being closer to realism mattered, Second Life would've crushed everyone, because it's much closer. And for those that haven't read about the uncanny valley that Philip mentioned, we shouldn't dive deep here, but you should go read it. It's a really interesting reality, when it comes to digital realism.Personally, I've always found that simpler heuristics go viral faster than complex ones. And so, when I equate what's happening in a Discord or a Twitter Space with what's trying to be achieved by Meta, one of them is a really simple heuristic. And by the way, I guess you could apply this back to Minecraft and Roblox, versus Second Life. The simpler heuristics, you get way more emergent behavior out of, because you have a much higher participation rate. Many more people are comfortable with manipulating and contributing. And so, you get this beautiful emergent complexity that comes out of it. And the most beautiful thing about Minecraft is some of the complex things kids have built with these very simple primitives. Philip: It's funny, because for me, the desire to kind of rebuild the laws of physics is better met by Minecraft in some ways than what we've yet been able to do with Second Life. So I agree with Bill on that. And I also think, by the way, that the idea of the world being alive and malleable, and subject to understandable laws is itself a cul-de-sac to talk about separately from communication and expression.I think there's an opportunity to build things beyond Minecraft that are simply compelling, because they are moldable and simple. And the outcome is spectacularly unknowable, like Bill said about people building things like computers that work inside Minecraft, which they've done by the way. The idea of that emergent complexity is one of the things that drew me to working on Second Life initially, but I have to admit that it's very separable from either the game experience or the communication experience. Bill: Another way of saying it, Patrick, is if I had to place a bet on whether someone that had 500 million users on a digital place platform, where people are communicating, and that they might add avatars or some digital thing that makes it more immersive, versus someone that built the perfect digital 3D avatar immersive system, but doesn't have the users yet. Boy, I'd bet on the first. Patrick: And obviously, Facebook has that network graph. In some ways, they have that interesting distribution advantage, and it raises the question for me of product, versus platform place, versus game. What the difference is between those two things, like you go into a game. There's a predefined objective, versus in Second Life, it's just a place the users do whatever you want. What lessons have you both learned about that contrast between maybe a platform on the one hand, versus like a specific, tailored product or game on the other hand? And which is more exciting in the future? If you're looking to invest today, how do you think about that distinction between investing in a great metaverse game, or some sort of a platform? Bill: We used to talk about this all the time at Second Life board meetings. And I think, when you look at many games, even like Call of Duty, the first hour or two of gameplay in Call of Duty, you go to basic training, and you learn primitives and stuff. And I think there's some things that are in between that have to do with onboarding, that get people committed, and bought in, and learned. I do think that anything that's game-oriented, especially for children, has the ability to keep them engaged more quickly, and you get quicker dopamine stuff versus a wide open system.What's interesting to me about some of these digital places, which I'm keeping separate from these avatar places, is they have that from the start. If I went to a Discord group because I want to work on this new blockchain group, we have a purpose. That's why we're there. I think purpose can really help onboarding new customers, and getting the engaged. That'd be where I'd leave it. Philip: I think that's well put. I mean, I think that games are, Bill mentioned escapism earlier, and you can actually look at it through the lens of ... You can kind of look at it, I guess, sort of at a huge meta lens of escaping from earth to somewhere else. But in the game experience, you can also look at as just escaping from your day to day life for a short period of time. But you can do that in a purely consumptive way where you are just on a ride and you go on the ride for an hour, and then you come back to the real world and just didn't add anything there. You just consumed an experience in the same way you'd consume a TV show. I think that's still the mainstay of what we do with gaming, but like Bill said, the purpose part inevitably has to be combined with some ability for you to do something perhaps with others that is constructive.I mean, it might be meta constructive, it might be investment or it might be ideation or it might be whatever, but there's a really big, big difference exactly artistic. There's just this huge difference between the play experience of consumption and then the together experience and the purposeful experience of making things. And I would just argue that the low level components and the platform components are at least somewhat different between those two. And going back to the Unity comment earlier, they're just very different beasts. And so I don't think we can expect to see them spring from new architecture equally. Bill: One thing I wanted to mention that may not be particularly in line with that question, Patrick, there's a element of the metaverse that are the classic definition of the metaverse that we experienced many, many times at Second Life that I've seen come up quite a bit in the press, which is some event will happen that's truly extraordinary. Patrick: The Travis Scott concert or something. Yeah. Bill: The Travis Scott thing, perfect example. And we had hundreds of those type examples in Second Life. People immediately make the leap that we're going to do these all the time. And I have yet to see that be true. There's the one off thing that's really interesting because it's unique, but then it's not replicated, the opposite of what people are extrapolating.",3985
299,"Bill Gurley, Philip Rosedale - Back to the Future",Crypto x Metaverse," Patrick: I'd love to explore this intersection of decentralized technology crypto, web3, whatever you want to call it with the idea of the metaverse collective behavior together online, because it seems like the promise of some of the decentralized permissionless technologies is that they can help us create better, more scalable versions of these things. Yet to date or 10 years into the crypto story. All of the places that we're talking about, Discord, Twitter, ROBLOX, all these places, Fortnite where the Travis Scott concert happened. They're still centralized companies that are running and responsible for and curating these experiences. Why do you think that is? Why haven't we seen an example that's more crypto native, something protocol enabled, that's as interesting as the Travis Scott concert or the congregation of all these people of humanity together. Like, what am I missing about why crypto hasn't produced more of these stories? Philip: It's the biggest conversation in the world, right? We could go on for days and days about that. But I think as it relates to virtual world, specifically, if you look at Second Life, we had to build a digital currency that spanned multiple geographies. Because if you walked up to somebody, I would always say if you just walked up to somebody in Second Life, right? There was a 60% or more chance if you're in the US, a 60% chance that they were not in your country. And so if you wanted to buy something from them, say Venmo had existed then, right? You can't just bust out Venmo and pay them offline. So we had to build basically a currency and we had to make it easy to use and very, very lower zero, in the case of Second Life, for most things fees to make a transaction.And I would just note that despite the excitement that we have about crypto and the legitimate excitement around maybe it's moving power or control from one place to another, we don't yet have a stable currency with low fees. We do not yet have it. There's lots of work underway. And that works interesting. Of course, if we had crypto people on here yelling and scream about all this stuff, lightning networks and things that are happening, but the fact is there's not an easy way for me to pay you for something in crypto. And second life was dependent for its success on there being an easy way for me to say to Bill, hey, can I buy that really cool hat that you're wearing right now? And we're just not there yet. Bill: If I made a list of 25 things that I think inhibited us from getting to a higher place, I don't think I'd put decentralization on that list. The creators were cashing out 100 million a year last time I had access to the number. So Phillip gave the GMV, but they were taking out a hundred million. So they were getting the money out. The decentralization kind of has two parts, a technical component and a trust governance component. I think from a technical component because of everything you've talked about from a performance standpoint, putting more things on a blockchain versus a database would only make it more difficult to do what you need to do in a 3D world. Philip: There are a couple of vague examples of what Bill is saying. There are several neutralized versions in a sense of Second Life that are out there today that you can go walk into right now. And just Bill said, what you'll see is that they're much earlier in their capabilities because it's much more difficult and expensive to do things in a fully decentralized fashion. I always talked about crypto in some measure as being the price of distrust. If you want to build a distributed system in which no one trusts anyone, you will realize that there is a fundamental basic cost to that. And that cost is nowhere near zero. And it's nowhere near low enough to create a virtual world yet. Bill: But there are two sides to this, or maybe I'll go back and use my word fork. The governance part is possible. And so interestingly, both Reddit and Discord, although they backed off of it have made comments about looking into tokenization Reddits, talked about doing it at a subreddit level. So could you imagine a subreddit where the members get to make a decision about whether it's a subscription model there or whether ads can run or who gets to moderate what? That's kind of interesting combining what we said earlier about digital spaces, maybe that's where these things might intersect. Philip: I would say from just going back to Second Life, I agree. I think crypto has got two big things embedded in it. One of them is working pretty well today, like it or not, so to speak. And the other one hasn't really been worked on, and that is frictionless capitalism is like what crypto is doing. And that's part of what's interesting about it right now, but the other part of crypto, like Bill said, that's embedded is governance and in particular democratic government. And I think that we are a couple of clever innovations and I'd like to work on them away from seeing something where, for example, you can vote one vote per person in a meaningful, easy, quick way on something as a group using crypto. We are not yet there, but there's a bunch of people working on that. And I think that once we see the impact that crypto could have on simple, scalable forms of governance, particularly democratic governance, that's going to be really, really cool. And we're not there yet, but there's good light on the horizon. Patrick: It brings to mind like one of the most interesting little factoids I've discovered in the crypto gaming space was for Axie Infinity when I want to ask about play to earn here in a minute and earning by via online participation, but they didn't explode until they created this Ronan side chain that didn't have the frictions of Ethereum itself. When they were trying to have their economy beyond Ethereum, it just couldn't possibly work. It wasn't scalable enough. When they made Ronan, which is fundamentally like not decentralized, it's like controlled by the company. Like it has all the problems. It probably looked a lot like the Second Life economy currency control system work. The thing exploded in activity. And I think it's a great, like actual, real recent point of kids be magic. It has to be low friction and you have to manage it in order for there to be commerce on top of the platform. It seems like kind of the same thing. Bill: As Philip said, if you distrust everyone, Satoshi's blockchain is amazing. Patrick: Yeah. Yeah. Bill: But it's ridiculously expensive as a database. And one thing that I think the Bitcoin maximalists miss is that there are degrees of decentralization and degrees of governance. And I've seen this in the open source world. So the Linux is a much more decent governance structure than Android, which is pretty much controlled by Google. There's a continuum of decentralization. And people would argue Ethereum's at a different place than Bitcoin and Solana's at a different place. And they all trade off on these two things Phillip talked about, which is trust versus performance, and cost. Patrick: Bill, your partner Mitch Lasky taught me kind of everything about the evolution of the models in gaming from $60 for a game to free to play with whale dependent spending to play to earn. What do you both make of the business model behind some of this stuff? As you think about Second Life, if you were to try it again today from scratch, like how would you think about business model? How do you think about concepts like play to earn? Is that fundamentally just a race to the bottom? How should we think about the evolution of games and these places and how people earn or spend money? Philip: That's a big couple of questions. I mean, one thing I'd say echoing something Bill said, if you told me to build Second Life all over again, right now I'd focus on, first of all, knowing as we discussed before that, without magic changes that haven't happened yet, we're going to have a smaller audience. So I'd want to be saying at the get go, this is going to not be the new internet, but it's going to be something amazing. Then what I would do is focus on simpler building blocks that were still adequate for people to be expressive so that the on ramp to the thing could be a lot easier. And that would get us to a larger market than we have today. But as we touched on earlier, it doesn't just mean that you get to get 4 billion people using the thing.I've always said about crypto versus the internet, I was there as Bill was, I was there in 1994 when we started the internet, so to speak. And the thing that was really different in comparing say crypto and the internet was we actually all knew what the internet was for. There was a strong sense of urgency. We had to have email addresses because you get calls from people or you get emails from people. And we had to put up websites about what our companies did. There was a very real, like let's get this party started sort of a thing because there was a utility function that was obvious around broadcasting information and crypto doesn't yet. It's anchored to a couple of big ideas, some of the same ones that were in Second Life, but those ideas as yet have no immediate utility. I think that's part of what makes it so polarizing and divisive when people talk about it is that there's not just a basic, like everybody's got to get crypto because now all chewing gum and hats worldwide bought and sold using crypto. We're just not there yet. Bill: Specifically on the pay for performance thing. I think it's remarkably nuanced and tricky. There's a ton of people that are thinking about tokenization and how that intersects with a marketplace company or a UGC company and a game company. Those all three would be the same thing in my mind. Certainly, if you have a hard form network effect, then getting initial conditions going and increasing liquidity might then lead you to success.And so if you build the right incentive structure around your tokenization, that could be a massive advantage to an on ramp, especially if you're able to get your currency to appreciate over time. And that's why earlier in this conversation, one thing, if I went back on Second Life, I'd probably not stay with the fixed currency. I'd probably let it explode. I mean, I'd probably not increase the money supply. I'd probably let it explode because of the incentive structure that then creates... You get a double incentive structure. The participant gets handed a coin that might go up. It's like you're handing out lottery tickets to everybody.Now, whether or not that remains legal, we could have another hour about AML and KYC, because Second Life spent $20 million on those protocols. But anyway, I think it's remarkably powerful, but you can miss too. The internet has from the very beginning and continues to be the ultimate arbitrage machine. And if you make a mistake that someone can get rich off and arbitrage, they will. That's the risk that you have with those types of structures. Philip: I remember Bill that being a point that, yeah, you made to great effect. That was very helpful. The Second Life was anything that can be arbitraged will be instantly. And now that was something I took to heart. I would add that if you look at pay to play or you look at this idea of there's a limit case that Second Life demonstrates where everything that's built is creative and the native value and all the assets driven by the creative efforts of the participants, there's a far other side version of that, where you have a scarce set of fixed assets in a virtual world, and you basically allow people to compete to farm those assets by essentially how much time will they devote to get those assets distributed? I think that's an extraordinary like Bill said, very nuanced. That's an extremely different thing than something like Second Life. This pay for performance type thing.I guess I would say that it's also something that we must outside of the capitalist model be thoughtful about. That may be something which does real harm to people. I think as entrepreneurs, we have a responsibility to be thoughtful about that. Patrick: We talked already about taking the Ferrari from Grand Theft Auto to among us. But I remember originally when I started exploring crypto in 2016, 2017, one of the core ideas really called my attention was the internet was about the permissionless open exchange of information. And this is about the same open permissionless exchange of value. Digital asset ownership in a trustless way should lead as a simple building block, back to that concept, all this other crazy stuff. And we're kind of seeing that, the market value of let's say NFTs or something bubble or not is a large number compared to like the market value of all in game items or something from pre-NFTs. How do you guys think about that as an exciting component of the metaverse of all these concepts, this idea of persistent, provable, trustless, digital ownership? Philip: I want to tell you a story from Second Life about that, because I think you'll get a kick out of it. And Bill had just joined the team at this time, but we had a meeting about the end of 2004, where we brought a bunch of people who didn't have a background in necessarily in computer games, but they were just big thinkers about this together in a room and had a meeting about this stuff. And we were talking about digital assets and their intrinsic value and like what them real, what will make things that people make in a virtual world real outside of those things being the result of their creative efforts, which was kind of fundamental to our strategy. We were talking about exactly the issues that we're seeing today with NFTs. And one of the people in the room in this meeting that we had invited was Lawrence Lessig.And I remember this moment where we were talking about what is the value of digital things? What makes them real? And he said, ""I'll tell you exactly what makes them real."" And he said, ""What will make digital goods real is if they are alienable."" And he said this word alienable and it was so funny because I had one of these moments where we didn't yet have iPhones. This is 2004. And I thought to myself, well, shoot, I don't know what that word means at this table of really smart people. And I don't know what alienable means, but in short, what alienable means is that like a hat like you're wearing, alienable means something that you can sell or give to somebody else without anybody else being in the middle of the transaction, your clothes on your body, the things on your desk, the paintings on your wall are alienable. Your car, your iTunes, your house, more complicated.Other people have to be involved. So that idea was fundamental. And it came out of this meeting in 2004 and we went to a law conference in New York and made the pronouncement that we intended to build a world where we made no claim on the intellectual property that people created. And that to the greatest extent possible, and someday in a decentralized fashion, no one would be able to stop somebody from selling something to somebody else. And so that was very, very much what NFTs for example are enabling today. And I think it is very important. People want the freedom to control trade person to person. Bill: Yeah. Although they are building secondary rates and to several of these NFTs. Yeah. I think authenticity and scarcity, to the extent that you can validate both of those things, obviously you're going to create economic value. As we already mentioned, I don't think taking that asset from one platform to the next, I think that's kind of a wink. I don't think that's a real thing because the likelihood of having applicability there, I mean, I guess that could become some emergent property if everyone bought into the same... You'd have to have some type of framework that two different games both agreed upon for that aesthetic or that performance enhancement to matter. But the odds of that are pretty low at this point in time. But if there's a construct within NBA fandom or something within one of these worlds and you want to keep authenticity scarcity. And what Phillips said, the ability to be able to trade it. Obviously, those things enhance the economic value of a digital asset. Patrick: Interaction, which we talked a lot about as a key driver of the metaverse, the Discord concept, and ownership. Like these are huge concepts that we're recreating digitally with powerful effect. Bill, you've studied bubbles and value creation and value capture for a very long time. As you look at something like the emergent NFT economy and some of the speculative returns, that Santa magic wand would not cost $50, it'd probably be $50 million in today's context. Offer your reaction to kind of what you're seeing today. Where does it just seem insane? Where does it seem like there's lots of promise hidden in the rough? Bill: I'm going to answer the question, but just a quick aside, when Philip brought up the magic wand, I was thinking about... I remember when pets became huge in Second Life. We had these digital chickens and they got really, really popular and your server ran the whole time. So your chickens would evolve even when you weren't there. It was really cool. Philip: Very much like crypto kitties. I mean, it was interesting. We did, as Bill said, we had these pets that people would breed and they would grow. And actually that continues to be one of the big markets in Second Life. Bill: It's interesting to me. I've been spending a lot of time trying to go deeper on crypto. And I think there's a fascinating question about whether or not a token will have value if it doesn't have the ability to eventually rake a system that it's involved in. And one of the great examples out there is the Uniswap DAO and the Uniswap token. And in the DAO, it says that the community can vote to take a rake of up to 5%.And I think it's a fundamental question, if that term weren't in the DAO or if instead it said the community will never rake a transaction, what would that do to the value of Uniswap? And everything from my history of studying finance and economics would say that if you declared you'd never rake the system, governance token, simply the right to kind of control a group or community would be worth a fraction, a small fraction of what an economic token would be. I also think it's a fascinating question.Any primitive that's out there, there could be a version that's completely benign. The Linux Foundation's not trying to get rich. They're just trying to promote the success of Linux. So someone could create a Uniswap competitor where the DAO does say we will never rake the system. We're here solely for the benefit of the community. Ironically, that's truer to the narrative the crypto religious claim to be making. I think highlights a massive irony between them collecting tokens and where they say they want to get to. Patrick: Does it stand to reason then, Bill, that something like Ethereum might be philosophically at least intriguing to you because there is sort of like a, whether it's for minors or soon to be validators, there's a rake mechanism that's built into the incentive structure or the system itself? Bill: Yes. But I think there's an equally interesting counterpoint to that that Solana might be cheaper than Ethereum, but then the son of Solana might make Solana equally uninteresting. That's why someone said to me the other day, if Solana eats ETH then all of these tokens are worth far less than we imagine because there's just a race to the bottom.",4407
300,"Bill Gurley, Philip Rosedale - Back to the Future",What the Metaverse is Missing," Patrick: Something will come along to eat that. It's a fascinating thing to consider. If we bring it back kind of in last section here, thinking about the future of this metaverse concept and what is exciting and what isn't. Where Bill and Philip as a builder and investor, both, where do you think about interesting pockets of opportunity to build things? What doesn't yet exist that through all these lessons we've talked about from Second Life, through all the investing lessons from your career Bill, what is missing from the ecosystem that you think it could benefit from in pursuit of the right kind of global digital togetherness? Philip: Going to say something I think Bill was saying earlier, which is, if you look at that second idea of the metaverse being about enabling communication, and you forget about the avatar or the 3D environment, then it's interesting to say, what is the simplest next step, if there is, what is the simplest form of broad scale communication that kind of works for the internet? Is it something that looks kind of like Discord or something like that?I think the investment opportunity is to say what is that? What is the very simplest step forward from here where we all start to be able to communicate while we're doing the internet, whatever that means? Then what's the simplest medium of that? Is it just our voices? Is it 3D audio? That's what I've been working on for the last couple of years, making it sound perfect so that you close your eyes, you'd feel like you were in a room with people.If it's that, then what are the governance structures and the rules that we need to get to, to make that work for everybody? I think that's a really interesting space to look at. Like Bill said, I would entirely back up away from graphical detail and even avatars and everything in asking that question, trying to find a grown up version of something that works for all of us, not just Minecraft. I mean, we three have probably all used Minecraft. I doubt we use it on a day to day basis, but what is the simple thing that we would use on a day to day basis? Then what's the governance and the rules and the implications for centralization or whatever that we need to get to to enable that? Bill: I totally agree. If you take that simple starting point that Philip laid out, while he was talking, I was thinking about a whole bunch of crazy ideas. I told you about how my son and his friends get together and have a central meeting place. Well, me and my adult friends don't really have that. We might have a group on WhatsApp or something like that, but it's that kind of rudimentary.There was an interesting feature of BlueJeans that was a little bit different than Zoom, where someone had a room and I can remember Zillow was on BlueJeans for a while before they finally switched to Zoom. I remember Rich had a room, Rich Barton, and he would just say, ""Oh, come by my room."" I would go in and it'd be like us joining a Zoom call, but there'd be two or three people there.But he had set that expectation of everyone with his room. That was cool. That was a cool concept. I could imagine the marketing department having a Zoom room that's just live all the time. You made get a ping if someone's in there and then you could go in there and then you start to have serendipity around that thing.This notion of digital connectivity, bringing together like-minded groups, whether they're professionally organized or whether they're ad hoc organized, which I think is more what Twitter spaces is doing. I think that's all super interesting and could give way to a ton of different, really cool, emergent things. Patrick: Maybe a fun closing question for you both and then I'll ask Phillip my traditional closing question since Bill's already answered it. Again, my friend Matt Ball has a ETF now called Meta, quite funny that he beat Zuck to the meta ticker, get a kick out of that. But it is meant to be a financial exposure to this idea of the metaverse. It's filled with meta, with Facebook, with Nvidia, with a lot of the companies that might power this emergent thing, if it comes to be.What would your synthetic financial exposure be if let's say we wanted to get exposure to the version of the metaverse, maybe not the avatar version, but the coms version. What would your ETF of the metaverse be assuming you could buy private companies, you could buy cryptocurrencies, you could buy anything. What do you think it would look like? Would it just be Discord? How do you think about financial exposure to the metaverse? Philip: It feels to me with the metaverse, we're still super early. I mean, if you wanted to go for a short term win, then you'd get into things like we're talking about like Roblox, that's clearly something that is working for a specific demographic. If I could reinvest in Second Life and look at how does Second Life take advantage of technology changes to be more accessible to its audience and enlarge its audience somewhat. Sure, I'd look at ways to do that, but I'd say it's still quite early. I'm interested in what Bill says. I don't really know. I don't know how I would do it. Bill: Consistent with what we talked about. I mean, discords not public so you could get some shares, I think to put that in there. I think Roblox, you got to give credit to. I think Zoom has a shit ton of potential to things they could do on top of where they stand if you view it in the way we described it as digital connectivity and communication. There's a lot of ways you could go from there.Those are the things that excite me. When you think about Facebook and you did mention they do have billions of users, I would be way more excited for them if they were doing a bottom up thing on top of that liquidity. I think the top down avatar driven thing completely disconnected from that platform. I don't put a lot of excitement into that being successful. Philip: We didn't touch on something that I've become, I guess, to some extent, a reluctant expert in which is the VR headsets and the problems therein. But in short, adding on to what Bill said, I think that believing that there's a way that we're all going to put on a funny headset and that it's going to transport us to other worlds or even put stuff on top of the real world. I think that is as yet a very difficult and unproven theory and trying to build community infrastructure that's dependent on a VR headset, which is part of what Meta strategy is, just doesn't feel like the right direction to me. Bill: By the way, I might include Reddit and Twitter too, just because I think things that bring these community groups together in the start place are super interesting. Patrick: We didn't touch on your interpretation of VR and AR, can't finish a metaverse conversation with at least touching on that and your kind of view on them. Bill: I'd be much more excited investing in a AR type thing because of all the stuff we've talked about. That could maybe be audio. I'm on a tour. I'm standing in front of a building and it just tells me some of the visual overlay stuff, it's super pragmatic and interesting.I do think there are some things people are getting a lot of value out of with the full 3D immersive, especially gaming. I've heard good things about Trip and some of the anxiety and meditation stuff, but it's not the end all, 4 billion user type thing for all the reason Philip talked about. Patrick: Audio's such an interesting, talk about Twitter spaces kind of taking off, Clubhouse, who knows where that's going, but audio as a specific standalone medium seems incredibly compelling. What have you learned building in this space in the last couple of years? What would be the most surprising findings or potential for new technology when we think just about audio as a medium of community and exchange? Philip: If you want to get to something amazing, you want to get to something that everybody perceives as having immediate basic utility and audio is certainly that. I mean, in the age of COVID, for a lot of people that say know each other well, a lot of businesses transition from that video on all the time to experimenting with rooms, like Bill was mentioning with BlueJeans, and experimenting with audio only, where you can just kind of pop in and talk to people, especially for people you know, audio, if it's done right, convey a lot.The big magic trick with audio, which is what we've worked on at High Fidelity is that if two people talk at the same time, you can't understand them unless their voices come from two different points in space. That's the simplest way to explain it. That cocktail party feeling of being in a conversation in a party at a conference or something, that's all driven by this magic of the audio being three dimensional, where it seems to be coming from where it's coming from. That's what enables you to feel to be part of two conversations at once, for example, which is a very common thing in the real world, but very uncommon online.There's a magic trick associated with advancing 3D audio. It's what we've been working on at High Fidelity and we've got customers at Clubhouse that are using it to do that so that multiple people can talk at once and it feels great.There's so many learnings like time delay. One of the things I'm obsessed with, I'm a latency freak with this stuff. The time it takes from my sound to get to your ears, if it's below two tenths of a second, we get along with each other and we have fun and we interrupt and have a lively conversation. If it's above two tenths of a second, we have that painful waiting to talk, stepping on each other cell phone experience. That's an example of where good technology work can bring us from disliking people we meet online to liking people we meet online.Then the other one is just, how do I give you a room with 1,000 people? Then that goes back to what Bill was saying about Discord is how do I come up with a simplest experience that, for example, gives me a lot of scale, because that's something that we haven't had on the internet, we haven't had on any of the video games that are out there yet. Patrick: Bill, I'll make up a closing question for you. What are you watching most closely as it pertains to the metaverse? What signs or companies or people are you just tracking? Bill: That may have changed having set through this call and listening to this ideation. I think one thing that could be somewhat interesting is the emergence of the adult version of what I described with my son's use of Discord. It might happen on top of Discord. Touching on the thing we said about games, there are adult games when groups of adults get together on the weekend, frequent to play spades or do charades or something like that. It's actually quite shocking that we don't have a digital form of those more simplistic type adult games that bridge and might add in the audio piece, maybe video, that Phillips talking about and Zoom could do that, Discord could do. A whole bunch of people could do it, but if someone got all the ingredients just right, something like that could take off I think pretty quickly. Patrick: Philip, a technical question with the latency as the root of the answer. Is it conceivable that we could just have a whole wall that's a screen that could be made to look like I'm looking into another room and then it sounds like someone's talking at me? That's something that seems can mix technology to make it feel physically like I'm in a space with somebody else. Is that a conceivable version of this in the future that reduces the friction of connection across space and time? Philip: Well, yeah. I mean, if you use something like Clubhouse today, like we're talking about, and I agree with Bill, I think Twitter Spaces is also really important to look at right now and see what happens there. If you use Clubhouse, you get this experience of hearing people all around you, which is really, really cool. I mean it's a different experience. You can do that with a wall. The only little technical geeky point I would make is because you and I and Bill are all three of us are using pretty nice microphones, is that being able to walk around the room while you talk to people through the wall, no, we're not there yet because the problem is we've got to keep your mouth close to a microphone. There's a physics problem with that.But I think that one's solvable. Microphones are getting better and better, but it's still a problem. Your AirPods, which we're not using on this call for that specific reason, just don't reconstruct the sound of your voice well enough to do a good job with 3D audio. Patrick: Bill and Philip, this has been awesome. I mean, what an interesting exploration into some real world experience that you've had with a lot of these concepts that have everyone worked up into a excited tizzy and how the future might look. Philip, I ask everyone new to the show the same closing question. What is the kindest thing that anyone's ever done for you? Bill: I probably have two thoughts. One, there were a number of people that I think took a bet on me and helped my career along that had they not done that it would be hard for me to know that I'd ended up where I am. One person that really stands out as Al Jackson, who ran equity research at Credit Suites. I cold called him. You know that story you hear everyone, ""Oh, I went to Manhattan and knocked on doors."" I did that. All the other firms eventually turned me off.By the way, when I got there from the University of Texas, I remember we had an orientation and the other 41st years we went around the room and asked us to say what college you were from. It was Wharton, Harvard, Wharton, Harvard, Yale, Chicago, Yale. I was the only one even I think below the Mason Dixon line. Al took a shot. I've kept up with him, which is great. I've been able to tell him that many times, but that was super, super impactful to my career. Philip: Kind of the easy answer. Then there's the harder answer. Like Bill, the easy answer for me would be specifically in the case of second life, too. Mitch Kapor, who was the first investor in Second Life and story people often don't hear, and I mean, Bill knows as well from us is Second Life was a pretty odd idea. It may not seem like it now, especially with all this metaverse stuff, but it was really pretty difficult to get people's heads around the idea. I think there were a lot of moments where we wouldn't have made what we were able to make there if I wouldn't have had people saying, ""Keep going, keep going. Don't worry. Your investors don't understand, but you got to just keep going, keep going, keep going.""I really appreciate Mitch for that. But I guess I would say the elephant in the room too, is I can't come up with those stories very easily. Maybe that tells us something about tech and what we all are doing and what we need to think about. I don't know if there's enough kindness out there in that space. I mean the tech, I guess, is supposed to be this vast unfettered capitalism where we're all just trying to climb over the bodies and get to a new idea. I don't know. It does feel a little bit like a time to reexamine that, why more of my kindness experiences are outside of work, which is for me the case. Bill: I will defend Silicon Valley a tiny bit and reply to Philip in that I do think, and I've said this before, one of the most amazing things about Silicon Valley is nine times out of 10, if you ask someone for a reasonable amount of their time, they tend to give it to you. The people that are successful had that happen for them, and then for the most part, turn around and try and do it for others. I think Mitch Kapor would agree with that being his place in life right now. There is an unwritten rule of helping people out that I think is pretty pervasive. Patrick: Well, this has been a fantastic wide ranging really fun conversation. Thank you to you both for your time. Can't wait to watch what happens with the metaverse. Bill: All right.

301,Francis Davidson - Design-led Hospitality,Introduction," Patrick: My guest today is Francis Davidson, founder and CEO of the hospitality brand, Sonder. Francis launched Sonder in 2013 as an alternative to traditional hotels and rentals with a specific focus on technology and design. During our conversation we discuss where Sonder fits into the hospital ecosystem and why design is so key to their offering. We also touch on Francis's unique views around customer centric focus, the nuances of hiring a team and how they approach decision making. Please enjoy my conversation with Francis Davidson.",112
302,Francis Davidson - Design-led Hospitality,Sonder's Origins & Business Model," Patrick: So Francis, I think will begin the conversation with some overall philosophical thoughts on business. I love this first question. What do you think about the idea that everyone has to deliver the best possible customer experience? This seems like the most commonly accepted trope. Thanks to probably Jeff Bezos and a few others. What do you think about this idea that it's the obligation of a business to deliver the best possible customer experience? Francis: I love this topic. And I'm generally not a believer in absolutes. Oftentimes the team will ask me to come up with what's the most important company goal or what are the things that we're going to prioritize. So the way I see it is that obviously customer experience is valuable for it to be good, but not at all cost. So if we were to plot both the value on growth and customer experience, so there's very simple trade off, suppose that it would cost me one unit of customer experience to get 10 units of growth, I'm getting a 10 to one return. And the next day I'm going to do a decision that has 10 units of customer experience in exchange for one unit of growth. The sum of these vectors gives me a really nice advancement of nine points on both customer experience and growth, will forgo the really great trade off that they could have or other dimensions of the business that are equally valuable to be successful. Patrick: Probably the right time to just at a high level, give the thumbnail sketch of what Sonder is and does. But maybe give me an example from your own experience of making a decision that actively went against customer experience as the north star. Francis: Sonder is a modern hospitality company, beautifully designed spaces that we manage and run our own selves. So we built quite a lot of technology that allows us to offer some hotels and apartments that look really great, especially to millennials and gen Z. And we build a lot of tech to basically manage those spaces far more effectively so that we can cut the fat in the industry and offer some really incredible guest experiences, but at price points that are affordable. So it's really a visual business as well. So going on our site and checking out some spaces brings it to life more than how I can explain it.And maybe one example in which that occurs is, for example, we work with some property owners and sometimes they're building property from scratch for us. The other times, it's an existing hotel that will convert into a Sonder asset. There's quite a lot of investments that need to be made in order to bring it up to brand standard and to make the spaces really look incredible. And so, for example, one of our competitor's approach has been to really go balls to the wall and customer experience and require that the level of investment is really extraordinary. And frankly, one of our competitors has built the top performing property in New York. It was the number one TripAdvisor rated property in New York City, a huge accomplishment. But I think they'd spent something like $40,000 of their own capital per unit in order to make that happen.We decided to go with a model where we source directly from factories overseas and optimize the cost structure such that it costs us something like 10,000 per key. And it was small enough so that we can convince owners to actually foot the bill for it. And so we had a model where basically our payback periods are single digit months on a new property, whereas this competitor, we're talking about potentially multiple years in order to pay back the investment. Their customer experience was a little bit better than ours. Ours though was still way better than other hotels and better than most of our comps. So it was a beloved customer experience, it just wasn't the number one.But because of our unit economic advantage, we could then generate substantially more growth with less capital invested in the business. And then economies of scales start kicking in and the flywheel start spinning in way where we're just so far and above the competitor's size that we win the market. So there's plenty of other examples like that, but growth, unit economics and customer experience, I view as three really crucial components that have to be carefully weighted one against the other. I think it's a mistake to just think that customer experience is the ruler above all other business objectives. Patrick: There's a lot of these other philosophy type business questions that I want to ask. But I think before we do that, it makes more sense to tell the Sonder story and describe the business in some detail, because that would be the rich context on which we can then lay some of these other questions. So maybe take us back to Sonder's founding. What was the first moment where you realized that there was something to build here and had an original product view that you could start doing back in 2013? Francis: It's been such a surprise to me building this business. I wasn't coming from an entrepreneurial family or wasn't my life's journey. I just stumbled upon this problem as a college student. I was in Montreal, studying at McGill. And I saw a bunch of my fellow classmates were leaving for the summer internship opportunity, going back home, whatever it is. There's thousands of empty apartments that are just lying around the center of Montreal and the high season during the summer when all the tourists loved to come. And I thought that I could make use of these assets. I could rent them out to travelers, pay some money to those students that otherwise would have an empty apartment. And did that for a couple summers as a side gig to earn income to get me through my college degree. And realized a couple years in, I had something like 80 apartments I was managing for the summer.There was no brand that was offering an apartment alternative accommodation, alternative to a hotel that came with really high consistency in quality. There was no brand in that space. You'd seen in the hotel industry, large brands like Hilton and Marriott offer standards consistency. Holiday Inn actually is a phenomenal all American story of consistency driving huge value. But we haven't seen that in the short term rental space. And so that was the original insight. And, of course, the vision has expanded substantially since then. We stopped working with student apartments, now we work with developers, as I mentioned, hotel owners that modernize their assets so that we can offer better experience, specifically to millennials and gen Z. And also developments of new properties that are specifically built for Sonder's use case. About 50% of what we do is apartments, the other 50% is hotels.But the original insight just came from my summer at McGill. And it's been just a wild journey since then. Incorporated the business when I was 19 years old and had to learn everything on the spot. Made a ton of mistakes along the way, but ultimately the insight that there could be a new hospitality company that started off with alternative accommodations, but grew into hotels as well. Now, has the ambition to move to any accommodation category, frankly, villas and cottages and even glamping. I think all of them could benefit from really great beautiful design, which I think one of the Achilles seal of the hospitality industry is not enough of a focus on design, and second, the application of technology to modernize the service, meaning you can do everything on your phone, on an app. You can request an early check-in and you can connect with WiFi with one tap. And basically all the services and information that you'd require from staff at a hotel can be transposed onto your phone. And by doing that, really rethinking the cost structure of the industry so that we can offer some really elevated high quality, almost luxurious experiences, but at price points that most consumers can afford. Patrick: Talk me through that cost story. So I'd like to hear more specifics on what the technology experience for the customer feels like, but also just where and why that cuts out cost. And maybe you could compare that to a hotel's overhead or some other hospitality zones cost structure and why yours is different. What are the big muscle movements there that you've been able to take cost down as a result of technology? Francis: Basically, we've broken down what it's like to operate a hotel and what are all the work streams that are involved in delivering a customer experience, and realized that the vast majority of what happens is done manually. So I gave this trivial example of early check-in, but one reason why I love to give the early check-in and the late checkout example is because over a third of all of our guests ask for an early check-in or early checkout. And the process to go and figure out is the room available and, oh, do I need to change rooms in order to offer it to you? And even the time it takes to interact with the customer, at what time do you need it and pulling up your reservation, etc, consumes quite a lot of time. And we've just completely automated that process. You open up the app and you just select a new time. If you look as well at services that were once necessary, but that aren't in our view in an era of on demand apps, so for example, room service is oftentimes a money losing operation for hotels requires quite a lot of staff. 24/7 is a requirement for a lot of four or five star designation properties.What we do is just say, ""Hey, you know what? Let's make it easy for you to get food delivery. We've done a partnership with one of food delivery companies so that we can just completely eliminate that service offering."" Obviously the taxi stand is another example. A lot of hotels still provide someone that whistles for the taxi. And on the Sonder app, you'll be able to just request a ride directly from the app. If you're at the airport, for example, you'll be able to say request Uber, automatically puts in your destination address so you don't have to type it in. Or if you're in London, for example, where there's seven king streets, you're not confused, you just arrive at the right spot. So basically, I could go on and on about the kinds of examples of things that basically require manual intervention that either things that could be automated or that frankly are just aren't necessary and can be obtained or can be delivered to the customer through a partnership that basically requires no cost on our side, but for an equally good customer experience. Patrick: Where does this manifest most in margins, in operating margins and gross margins? How do you think about the economic model of the business and where it differs most in the most apples to apples comparison you can make? So maybe in one of Sonder's properties that's most hotel like versus a Hilton next door or something, what are the areas that, that would most show up if I was to lay the two income statements side by side or the two balance sheets side by side? Francis: You'd see the operating costs at a property level. If you look at the real estate investment trust, for example, there is these publicly traded companies that have basically a bunch of hotel assets on their books, and they're going to generate free cash flow margins of call it 15% to 20%. We call it pre COVID-2019 levels of free cash flow margins. For Sonder, we can generate similar amounts if not better. I think what we showed is our steady state, what we think once we've fully built up the technology, we think we're going to be able to be at roughly 30% what we call property level profit margins, but without owning the underlying real estate.So what's crazy is that we can generate cash flows that are similar to that of those who own the real estate, but by still delivering a large quantity of economics to the owners. So by taking on an asset, the stream of cash flow as the present value of our operations in that asset is equivalent to the underlying value of the real estate, even though we don't own it. So if we were to own the real estate, then you'd be talking about margins that are much, much higher. It'd Be in the 60 plus percent range instead of being in the 20 to 25% range as a result of these costs going out the window. We say that roughly the operating costs advantage that have versus a traditionally operated hotels in the realm of about 50%. Patrick: So walk me through, let's just say there's $100 transaction, I go to stay somewhere for $100. Just talk me through how that $100 revenue event flows through the traditional system including the real estate owner versus how it flows through Sonder. I just think that's like such a wild comparison that you can have the same margin without owning the property. Francis: At Sonder, there's no process to receive your luggage. We have luggage lockers that are self-served. We have also what we call an essentials section where you can find extra coffee. And so basically call it guest requests are going to be self-served by the guest either in person through the physical things that we put in the property or digitally by just interacting with the app and getting that early check-in and that late checkout. Housekeeping, for example, instead of offering it daily and having someone go in, it's an opt-in mechanism. So you have to request it through the app. And there's some properties, specifically our larger apartment properties, where we also charge to the guest per use. And we realize that actually, actually, if people knew how much it cost to clean their room every day, they would opt out of it almost always. It's not a good value trip going back to the ROI of that investment. Patrick: Again, I'll come back to $100. If the building owner, let's say, or the apartment owner was to put this on Sonder, how do they get cut into the economics? And now maybe Airbnb is the app to comparison. If I'm someone that owns some place and I want it to be on both of those two things, how might that differ? How might the experience differ for the owner of the asset itself? It sounds like you don't own any of the assets. Francis: That's right. The way we structure our contracts, obviously it has to be a win for them. And so what we're going to look at is side by side of what their proforma looks like. Ideally, even historical results, if it's a hotel conversion, if it's a new development, we're going to look at comp properties around and what would be the PNL of the asset. And then we're going to position, we're going to put together an offer that's just slightly better than that, epsilon more than what they would've gotten is where we're going to start off our negotiations. And so the vast majority of the value creation of our superior cost structure is something that we get to absorb. And we have to offer only a small slice of that value to owners to entice them to work with us. Patrick: How do you think about density? So a lot of the times companies like this that are providing, whether it's Uber or Airbnb or whatever else, the network density matters. So having a big inventory in one city to start, for example, and really winning that market before moving to the next has been a common strategy that you hear about out. Where is Sonder, how many cities is it in? Is it primarily cities? How do you think about the geographic focus and markets and how you roll from one to the next? Francis: Yeah, I think that's great insight. And I think we probably could have done a better job. We're in 39 markets today. We're just scratching the surface of market penetration. And there was a lot of advantages in scaling locally, of course. If I had done it differently, we'd probably be at 39 markets today, but would've had fewer markets to begin with and reach scale in them. I think there's advantages for economics for just organizational complexity. Even frankly, for the quality of customer experience, it's better to be more focused. So we're increasing now our concentration into these markets really substantially.I also think there's another piece of concentration, which has been a painful lesson for us, which is even within a market, how concentrated we want to be. So we started off with student apartments and then one or two apartments in a building, and then maybe a small hotel. In 2018 is when we started doing independent hotel conversions. And now the majority of we do is over 100 units or 100Ts per property. And we also almost never take a partial building. It's an entire development and increasingly completely custom made for our design standards.We've built a capability over now seven plus years of figuring out what exact details there should be, the shower pressure, what it should be, and the temperature ranges that are part of our design standards. These documents have become really thorough. I view it as a competitive advantage, continuous improvement over nearly a decade to try and figure out exactly what we need and then get these assets built up and then manage the whole thing and control the entire experience from what it looks like on the curb, through the common areas, the hallways, and just every single detail being thought through. So concentration in terms of more units and more density inside a single building is probably even in the more transformational shift of our business beyond the fact that going deeper into existing geographies is also valuable. Patrick: You mentioned design earlier. And if you go to the website, there's a very distinct feeling to it. I'm not a design person, so I wouldn't know how to describe the aesthetic, but it definitely looks like, oh yeah, this feels like a Sonder space. Just talk me through the importance of that. After that, I want to talk about the supply chain stuff, like how do you get your couches and what have you learned about that sort of thing assuming you're the one either financing or buying those things or directing the owners to buy them. But first, teach me about design. What have you learned matters? What is your philosophy of design? And how did you develop it? Francis: Yeah, honestly, it's really simple. Go on Instagram and follow a bunch of popular architecture interior design accounts, study some of the good architects. And even the Bauhaus Movement, I think now is 100 years old and the Eichler Homes and Mid-Century Modern is now not something that's new, it's just really incredible design movements that have existed for a while, but just haven't been applied in the hospitality industry for what I call the mid-scale to upscale segments. There are some luxury boutique hotels that adopt that design standard that clearly like millennials and gen Z really love and aspire to in their own homes.But for some odd reason, I frankly, can't still piece it together today why is it that the hospitality industry keeps churning out these ugly hotels. I don't know how else to say it. Maybe it's a regional thing, maybe it's just there's less importance placed on it, but we're just basically studying some of the good design that exists out there and applying it. And we've hired some folks on our team that first thing I asked was, ""Hey, is it possible to get design that looks like this, but without breaking the bank?"" And like, ""Yeah, totally, it doesn't even cost more to be thoughtful about it, you just have to care about it and has to be part of the ethos of the organization."" Design is a word that's part of our mission statement. I don't think there's another hospitality company that has the word design inside of their mission statement. So having built that as the core value of the brand from the start has enabled us to do something that's quite differentiated. Patrick: I'm always interested in the jobs to be done in an any business, but certainly in this one too. And I remember reading about, I think it was Western that did some study and found that really the only thing people cared about was the comfort of the bed and the strength of the shower head. And they over invested in those two things at the expense of everything else, because those were the two key jobs to be done that people were looking for. What have you learned about that? What do you think matters most to people staying? I get guess another way to ask this question, if I was to try to build a guest room in my house, what should I overspend on and what should I underspend on to make people happy? Francis: Yeah. So I'm not sure I'm going to have a great answer for your guest in house, but I can tell you for the hospitality industry, what the opportunity looks like. I think there's three dimensions that are super important. The one we just discussed, which I'll call inspiring design, and it doesn't mean there's just one aesthetic, but it's just excellent. I am a believer in the objectivity of aesthetics. Being a philosophy student in college, it's a profound multi thousand year debate, but I do believe that there's such a thing as better and worse objective when it comes to design, and we ought to offer things that really look great that make people feel really good. So work with an interior designer and make sure that it's really thoughtfully done.Number two is what we call modern service. The idea that there is a really frictionless way for people to check in and get into their units. For example, for us, there's no front desk check-in process, you book on your phone, you verify your ID, once you've done it once you don't need to do it for other stays with us. And then you just get in your room with your phone and it's just completely seamless. And this is something that, for example, having an in-person interaction for our customer demographic isn't necessarily preferential or preferred to simply messaging back and forth and interacting with a brand using emojis and jiffies. It's just really convenient. You can do it on your phone, wherever we're at in the city. You don't have to pick up a phone in the room or go down to the front desk in order to get service, but you can just do it before or after your stay, wherever you are on a device that's native without really having to wait for someone to pick up the phone on the other side.So all these little benefits, but I think the modernization of service and specifically tailoring the message and using a medium that feels native and natural to the younger demographic, that is going to be the majority of travelers the next handful of years. The third thing I'd say is exceptional quality. That's something where things cannot go wrong. Travel is a high cost of failure, hospitality is a high cost of failure market. If you spend three nights somewhere and something goes horribly wrong, it can ruin your trip. And so making sure that of the hundreds of thousands of things that could go wrong, continuous improvement system that yields really high quality, consistency and predictability.So those are high level things, but I find that the Western question is a little bit reductive. I much prefer Jeff Bezos's analogy. I was reading his shareholder letters recently and he asked the question, instead of trying to predict the future, what are the things that are not going to change? And his view is just, well, I know that people are going to want more selection and they're going to want faster delivery times and they want lower prices. And then we can invest into that for a decade. So instead of something that feels, from my perspective, a little gimmicky, like a better mattress, for sure, it's important, but there's hundreds of things that are really valuable. And what are those meta categories? Well, the categories that we can invest into for a decade plus are inspiring design, modern service and exceptional quality.",5164
303,Francis Davidson - Design-led Hospitality,Strategic Decision Making," Patrick: Especially on the modern service front where technology really seems to figure strongly. And I'm thinking about the keyless entry via your phone. How do you decide around building versus partnering versus buying solutions like that? What is the tech behind that phone entry into the room? Is it like a hardware device? Do you build that? Do you partner with somebody? And how do you make those kinds of decisions generally? Francis: This is an area where we've done both. We actually have two systems running in parallel right now. One that's in-source that we've built from scratch and one that's outsourced. I think that's probably one of the mistakes that I've done building this company is that we started off doing too much in-house. Maybe that's the hotspot, the entrepreneur that's building company for the first time and then being confronted with the real world. And the fact that actually, the most simple thing like changing light bulbs at scale is a lot more challenging than what it turns out to be.So I think now we're much more focused on figuring out what are the true areas of R&D where differentiation is crucial. I think keyless entry systems. Maybe five, six years ago, there wasn't something great, but increasingly there are great solutions out there. I don't see us investing meaningfully that area of R&D into the future. But there are other areas, for example, like using messaging as a key component of interaction, like shifting the paradigm of service within hospitality to be messaging focused and using automation and AI in order to respond to customer requests that are frequent in real time in a way that feels warm and not the clunky chat bot. I find that, that, for example, is an area of R&D of a lot of value where we're going to be putting in a lot of resources. Patrick: And back on the design side, something you can continually invest in, how does that work? Do you have the property owners, do all the spending on the property, meaning buy the chairs, buy the beds, buy this stuff, and you advise them up to a standard or do you get involved there? It sounds like it's just a very asset light mentality as a business, but how do you handle that? Francis: Yeah. We have manufacturing part partners overseas in the US that we work with. We source and we buy from them. And then the owners will either give us an allowance or buy the furniture, the artwork from us. And so that way we can ensure that we're benefiting from economies of scale, there's quality control that's in place, but at the same time we get the capital light nature of it. So that was an evolution in our business. It's only been about a couple of years that we've been doing these fully asset light deals where owners are actually footing the bill. And we're putting in almost nothing which allows us really rapid paybacks and allows us to scale really rapidly without consuming an inordinate amount of capital.We love to have the control end to end, and there's a lot of learnings there, hey, something so trivial, but it's taken us years to understand what couches to buy, what fabrics can you use for hospitality grade that will clean well and that will age well and what sofa bed mechanisms can we use, because a sofa bed will increase RevPAR, revenue per available room, by 8% in one bedroom apartment leads to all these kinds of learnings. We're still not at 10 out of 10, even though we've been doing this for seven plus years. So we wouldn't want owners to then just go out in the market and purchase what's available, because there really is institutional knowledge that's crucial for the whole thing to work there. Patrick: What have you learned about working with overseas manufacturing partners? Francis: It's not something that you can improvise. There's a whole industry of broker dealers and people that will sit in the middle, whereas we've just ended up hiring folks that came from the industry where they actually did furniture and artwork, then bedding linens, procurement for some large brands and had already contacts overseas and knew and had worked with certain factories before to hiring people that really, really understand how it works was really crucial there.Maybe one thing that comes to mind now is the idea that planning for the useful life of these assets. So, for example, when you work with a manufacturer, they should also send you extra chair legs and they should send you markers for the exact finish of the wood that's being used so that you can do touch-ups and maintain them over time instead of having 20% extra inventory and swap out the whole thing. You can actually repair and keep these assets useful for a very long time if you work with manufacturers that are used to delivering that care package. Patrick: How about on the growth side? So you mentioned at the very start of our conversation this balance between customer experience growth and unit economics what's the growth equation for Sonder? How do you think about the key levers that will drive your future success or failure? And then how do you build strategy around those levers? Francis: We need to have a value proposition to property developers on the one hand that have maybe a plot of land or maybe they're in the process of building a building or converting an office given that they're not too bullish on office anymore and they want to convert that to a hospitality use. And then on the other side, it's operating assets, primarily independent hotels, of which there's a plethora, especially in Europe, our strategy there in markets like a Barcelona or an Amsterdam or a Paris where there's the vast majority of the property stock for hospitality is independently owned and operated not under a flag. There's often times these cities regulations that limit even the construction of new hospitality uses. And so we're really constrained to the existing supply. So there's a finite universe in some markets and other markets where the zoning is a little bit more lax. It's more about figuring out how we can entice property developers to work with us as their highest and best use.So listen, I think developers and convincing real estate owners to work with us is the way that this business grows. We are not a demand constrained organization. It's very easy to fill our properties. They look good, they have a good price point, they're offered with really high quality and consistency. So it's really all about supply growth. And on the supply growth side, the developers are homo economicus. They respond to ROI. And so it's all about... Basically, the pitch is a side by side spreadsheet. It's a model. It's also the capacity to convince their lenders and other folks around them. So developers will go and have LPs and they'll even syndicate their GP stake to some of these developments and they'll have lenders, construction lenders, and then take out lenders. Once the building is complete, they're going to swap out an expensive structure loan for much more inexpensive permanent financing.And so we've built a team of capital markets team to help them interface with their lenders so that objections that we can handle with the property developer themselves are still others that we have to convince in order to... Especially for big development projects, multi hundred units, could be in the tens of millions of dollars, $100 million plus projects, where we have to have a team that's really credible and knows to speak the language of these other market participants. It's all about creating a growth engine that makes it the best possible decision for a developer or property owner to work with Sonder. And it really comes down to the numbers. Patrick: Surprising, I guess, as a non hotel or hospitality insider to hear that it's not demand constrained and you can fill the rooms. What does a typical occupancy rate look like for hotel and Airbnb properties versus Sonder? Help me understand the rough numbers of how that tends to shake out in this industry. Francis: So in the last 18 months, we've been very, I'd say resilient and quick and adapting to changing market conditions. Travel demand evaporates overnight, revenue falls 75% for us from March to April 2020. What we decide to do is basically pivot towards what we call an extended stay offering. So instead of having people stay in our spaces for three, four nights at a time, which is our core business, we found folks that would stay in Sonder spaces for 14 days, 28 days plus. I myself did that for nine months with my girlfriend. We stayed in 20 plus Sonders across nine countries.So summer of 2020, we were right back to where we were pre COVID in terms of occupancy rates. Of course, prices were lower. We had to lower our prices in order to entice that longer term demand. But nonetheless, we managed to really outperform. That's been a really beautiful story for us of resilience, because our business model takes quite a lot of risk. We actually operate these properties. It's not 90% gross margin SaaS. We have operating costs. Even though we're more efficient in the industry, there's some risk to our business model. But it was really wonderful to see that the most extreme example of demand shocks that we would be way better at finding alternative ways in order to keep those rooms filled. Patrick: You've hit on something which I've become obsessed with sparked by your comment about pivoting to longer term stay, which is this idea of, I think Stewart Butterfield said it best, innovation literally is just behavior change that innovative companies cause consumers to do something that they didn't do before or do it differently. And the idea of traveling around the world, working from anywhere, staying for a month at a time in a Sonder property, that's a cool emergent property of the system. How do you think about category creation or category design in that context of changing the way that people behave? Francis: Let me maybe start with a Sonder specific example, which is that I think there's no better way to be a digital nomad than to stay at a Sonder property. The cost checks that box, the WiFi, the comfort, the service, the consistency. If something goes wrong, we have these large buildings where we can flip you to another unit in a matter of minutes. And I've done it myself for several months in the last year and a half. And it's been absolutely wonderful.And I'm not sure the extent to which we're going to be able to change consumer behavior. I think there's just a lot of people that are waking up and be like, ""Wow, I have the capacity to spend maybe a month in Mexico and work from there, because my employer's comfortable with it, and what a nice life experience that could be."" And I think that's going to be a lot more people than we have rooms to fill. And we just happen to be a beneficiary or have offering that works really well for that new demand segment that is much more substantial. It has accelerated probably by a decade plus as a result of the pandemic. Patrick: It's interesting to hear also how you think about if that new lifestyle is unlocked, which obviously it seems to have been your personal example of this. How do you think about market identification or qualities that make, you're in X cities today X+1? How do you think about the qualities of a great new market to go attack? What are the things that drive success in terms of market qualities? Francis: We've built a market prioritization model. I'll call it prioritization, because the ambition of the business is to be everywhere. That's going to take decades, but we truly want to be everywhere. So which places do we go first. There's a lot of variables in that model, but I think one of the things that's most important is just the depth of supply. Once we start seeding the market, we want to know there's going to be years and years of growth that's available there. And then our estimate of what the economics are going to look like. And, of course, if markets that are better for remote work are going to do a little bit better or else equal than they would've prior to the pandemic, and have been recovering faster, that moves them up a little bit.The bigger factors are really the size of the market, the total aggregate dollar opportunity behind a market. And then it's operational complexity, like is it nearby other markets that we currently operate in? So, for example, we're not in Asia. And so even though Singapore or Seoul or Tokyo sound like very appealing opportunities, when you look at the spreadsheet operationally, it's complex to do that versus say opening an Abu Dhabi because we're very successful in Dubai and we have a network that we're getting known and our business is working really well. And therefore, it might make more sense to launch Abu Dhabi that's an hour away than to launch something that's in a completely different geographical area.",2828
304,Francis Davidson - Design-led Hospitality,Business Philosophy," Patrick: Since you've been building the business for a while now, it's a good excuse with a lot of good groundwork laid on what Sonder is and how it works and why it's interesting to ask some more philosophy business type questions. So we talked about customer centricity and customer experience. Another common one on the company building side is this Netflix notion of talent density and that if you're going to do anything as a business, just focus on these higher As and Bs, higher Cs or whatever that trope is. And I'm just curious what you found about building a business talent density, the need for A players, because I think you might have another interesting contrarian viewpoint here. Francis: Funnily enough, I met Reed Hastings once and that's one piece of advice that he gave me very tactical. He said, ""When you hire people, references are super important,"" probably even a better signal than the entire interview process. And the way that people do it is wrong. People lie when they do references and therefore, you need to basically be on video with them. And that was, I guess, pre COVID, pre Zoom, but he said, ""Just FaceTime them, and don't tell them who the reference is about and do back channels only."" And that's how you see the truth. And anything that's under, that person was absolutely extraordinary and I was so gutted that they left and I'll do everything to bring them back is effectively a bad reference. And so it's a really interesting filter to use. Another thing that we started using is the latest 360 or performance evaluation. That honestly, there's so much more signal there than there is in conversations with people. People are very good at interviewing sometimes, very difficult to know how they're going to do on the job.But when you see an actual 360 of peers and their reports and their boss performance evaluation that wasn't meant to be shared with a prospective employer, this true honest perspective as to how they did in their last job, it is so much more valuable. And then what I'll do is I'll reciprocate with my own 360. It's just a really weird way to start relationship, because it's supposed to be about courting and I'm so great and you're so great and there are no problems. But when you just say, ""Hey, here's all the stuff I'm good at, but also all the stuff that people tell me I'm terrible at,"" it just builds this amount of trust and it just kicks off, I think the relationship in a much better way. It allows us to also have a differentiated interview process. There's a lot more stuff that we do there to be different than most companies that make it such candidates that really are into those innovations are not only impressed by the fact that we're having these kinds of conversations, but they're like, ""Wow, okay, there is meaningful innovation going on in that organization and I'm going to learn more tricks. If I'm seeing this in the interview process, what about how they do planning or how they hold meetings or all the other rituals that exist in the organization are likely to be,"" things are worthy of learning as well. Patrick: It sounds like you're one of these companies that I always think about, companies that treat their jobs and their hiring funnel like a product do really well. And I'm curious, you've referenced the things you do differently. What are the features of your jobs product? So if a job at Sonder is a product to be sold, what are those tactical or strategic differences in the experience for those you're hiring? Francis: The hiring process is really about doing two things. The jobs to be done are twofold. One is a prediction problem, which is, will this person be a top performer? So everything in the interview process has to basically help give you signal. If you're a Bayesian thinker, basically every conversation you have, every note you take, every part of the investigation is to give you a better shot at predicting whether they're going to be at the top of the performance ladder. And then the second one is sales and closing. And so I think we've designed an interview process that allows us to... At least for managers, it's very heavy, so I'm not going to do this for every IC, but for managers and executives in particular, something that's really thorough that is going to give us a much better prediction and much better likelihood to close in, bring that candidate in. Something that we look for that I think is potentially a little bit unusual is that we look for executives that are also masters at their craft. That's what we do in the second interview. The first interview is getting to know each other's story, actually laying the tracks for the sales component if it's useful in the end, just knowing the person's life story, taking some notes and then having that as nuggets to build connection later on, accelerate trust building and relationship building. But the second one is what I call a deep dive domain expertise interview. And so they'll just ask questions like what are basically your jobs to be done inside of your function? And then tell me things that you do that that few people do in your function that give you a differentiated capacity to reach these kinds of outcomes.And what I'm looking for here, frankly, is to learn stuff. There's a lot of people that turns out that have fancy and impressive resumes, but actually just don't do anything that's really different than anyone else. But it's like, if we're claiming that we're a company that's about top talent and people that really will do something special for the business, give us differentiated shot at building something great, they must be doing things differently. And if they can't articulate that in a one hour conversation, I think we're unlikely to get that outlier performer. Whereas there are some folks that are just truly masters of their craft and they can't wait. That's their favorite interview. They're like, ""Oh, I have so many tricks to share. Here's one thing that you could do in order to improve team engagement."" And then you hear this idea and like, ""Wow, that sounds awesome. No, one's ever told me this. And it sounds very credible.""And that person's telling me it's already working and I'm really excited about having that person implement some of these tried and true tactics inside of the organization.Another side benefit of it, especially for a first time entrepreneur like me was just learning a function. So if I want to hire ahead of HR, I'm going to interview 20 heads of HR and I'm going to go through 20 hours of domain specific interviews where I'm going to basically learn from people across the market what are their best tricks in order to perform in their function. And I'm going to start building this knowledge base and a familiarity with the discipline that's going to be really helpful in overseeing it later. Patrick: That's really cool. And I'd love to see your condensed notes on each function. After 20 conversations, it's a cool way to build knowledge while also hiring and recruiting. What do you think about A players and the density of A players on a company wide team? Does everyone at the company need to be an A? Does that present different problems? What's your view here? Francis: Again, I'm big believer in trade offs and everything that one does in an organization. Everything that you take on is implicitly something that you're not taking on. And likewise for customer experience, there's this belief that a company has to have only A players. And I've come to realize just in practice that's just not really the key case. Sometimes you have... Especially for capabilities functions that don't drive core company goals, where you have someone that's doing a fine job and then you just have to prioritize is it really worth it to try and find an A to replace that person if they're doing a fine job or should I just double down in other areas of the business or other teams that are performing extremely well? So it's just almost treating organizational up-leveling in this same way that you would a tech roadmap where you have a backlog and you can't do everything you need to prioritize.So there's an inherent lack of focus in trying to have As absolutely everywhere. Obviously everyone knows what to do with Cs, but Bs is something where I think there's actually a healthy amount of Bs in an organization. Especially as you scale and need to add so much headcount so rapidly, it could be practically just irrational if you have a bunch of open roles and you're dying under pressure, because you're growing really rapidly and you're like, ""Oh, let me like fire this B so that I can upgrade them with an A."" You're going to cause more organizational harm by doing that. And I think practically, that's what most organizations do. I don't think it sounds sexy to say it, but whenever I hear A's only, I become skeptical either your bar isn't all that high or you're actually causing quite a lot of damage in the organization and not prioritizing the things that are going to have the highest ROI. Patrick: And once you have these people on the team, how do you think about synchronicity of the team, the culture and rituals that drive or customs that drive that culture? How have you gotten better at that over time? And what's your philosophy here? Francis: If I look at just in a very abstract basis, what is it that us knowledge workers do all day? We sit in front of our computers and then we read stuff and then we write stuff and then we hear stuff and then we say stuff. That's basically the work that is done. And hopefully the things that we say and the things that we write are going to cause an organization to perform better. And so the way in which that speaking and that writing and that reading occurs is really crucial, how it's organized. And one of the biggest time sucks is meetings, especially for managers, business functions and so on.So the way in which meetings are run in our view is a massive decision. And so the person that we've taken, I think there was quite a lot of innovation again with Amazon, big students of Amazon referenced him with a few times. But I think a lot of cultural innovation is the memo. But instead of having a memo and a reading hall of beginning of the meeting, where basically, you pass out a printed document, I guess in the late 90s and everyone reads and then has a chat about it, what we do is that the memo is sent 24 hours before the meeting, it has defined sections. If it's a recurring meeting, for example, for a company goal meeting, there's going to be progress against OKRs. Every two weeks, we're going to look at that green, yellow, red commentary on which OKRs are on track versus off track. We're going to do a similar thing for roadmap progress. So of all the things that we said we'd do, are we on track or not, with some commentary, holding that accountability to inputs and outputs.And then the third part is going to be what we call problem solution. What are the blockers and what is the biggest issue that we find delivering better outcomes? And what are proposed solution and changes that we want to bring to the organization in order to just generate better output? And instead of just having someone write the problem solution and then having a discussion, we ask every participant in the meeting to submit the written commentary ahead of time. And the people that are invited to the meeting are called the brain trust of the meeting. So for the decisions discussed during the meeting, who are the most important relevant people in the organization? Whether they're senior or junior, it doesn't matter. Let's bring in the six to eight most important people and have them actually weigh in on that decision. If it's deemed to be really important company level decision, surely we want to have five, six brains think about it and reviewing each other's work before actually calling an important shot.And so every participant is going to write down their feedback. And then the meeting owner is going to appoint a decision maker for that decision. That decision maker will go through everyone's feedback and then write down a proposed decision after conversation. And then every person that's attending the meeting either will write down whether they agree or disagree. A plus one if they agree. If they disagree, what they would've done differently. And so it's basically a decision making mechanism and a way to ensure that we're collecting 360 view of multiple departments, multiple individuals before actually committing to a decision.So these meetings are highly structured in a way that basically forces us to have conversations in a way that's far more productive. Avoid a bunch of cognitive biases, be really robust when it comes to tracking action items and due dates. And there's a whole system that connects afterwards with Asana where we make sure that those things are being kept track of. And we inform out the decisions made are being transferred to the right people afterwards. But that infrastructure that relates to decision making and meetings in my view is a super important lever for organizational efficiency. Patrick: How does all this relate to building intentional strategic, competitive advantage inside of the business? I'm assuming you're a student of this as well, where the classic seven powers or five forces or whatever your framework might be for advantage versus peers and competitors. Obviously there's other players in hospitality and you're trying to do something new and drive a wedge and eventually be everywhere. How do you think about intentionally tying everything you just described in the meeting structure or the hiring or the product or whatever, back to competitive advantage? And what do you think those can be for Sonder specifically? What are the areas that you might be able to build real competitive advantage over time? Francis: Huge fan of the seven powers. Hamilton Helmer's 7 Powers: The Foundations of Business Strategy, I think is just a masterpiece. Read the book through Sonder's lens and tried to see how each of these powers could be built into the kinds of strategic initiatives that we pursue as a business. And really it comes down to us to five call, we call them co-equal company goals. And again, while avoiding the prioritization, I think it comes down to the quality of the customer experience for which there's a series of measurements, the growth volume and quality of growth. Of course, in the OKRs of each of these company goals, there's counterbalancing metrics to ensure that we're not going one direction at the expense of another.And then the third is our capacity to generate demand. So what we call in the hospitality industry RevPAR, revenue per available room, just how much monetization can we squeeze out of a room occupancy and price the product of occupancy in price. And then we have the cost to serve, these efficiency metrics that we described earlier in terms of our capacity to deliver an experience at a really efficient cost structure by the leveraging technology. And then finally the employee experience. Do people really love it here? The level of employee engagement. So those are the five dimensions of the business where we think that there is huge value. And then for each of these, we have a much more routine cadence where we ask ourselves, what are the biggest problems to solve? So every two weeks we do one of these decision making meetings and review of the roadmap and the OKRs.And then for other departments, obviously other things that are important in an organization, it can't just be five metrics, then we have the monthly cadence. So we built into our customs, a distribution of time that's proportional to the importance that it has to move the needle organizationally. And then there's clear executives that are responsible, the stewards of each company goal and their company goal because every department works on them, but we've appointed individuals within the organization that are really... The ones that we're going to look towards in order to actually deliver on the most important things.",3428
305,Francis Davidson - Design-led Hospitality,The Future of Sonder & Hospitality," Patrick: If you til this up and think about the most radically positive version of the Sonder story, five or seven years from now, what do you think that looks like? What position, if you've hit on all cylinders between now and then, what will the company look like then relative to today? Francis: I'm hoping that we're actually going to fulfill the vision of being able to offer truly modern and automated operations within the hospital industry. But we're really, I'd say 20% of the way there right now. It's crazy to think about the fact that we have an engineering organization of over 100 people yet in many years we've only been able to build 20% of the stack. It is really a complex media problem to bring this industry into the modern era. So I'm hoping that we'll be much further along there, that we'll be all over the world, call it the top 100 global cities, including Asia, including Latin America that our spaces will be featured in design magazines. I really, really love the idea of Ray and Charles Eames, for example, not only were incredible designers, but were one that shared this philosophy that great design ought to be democratized and available to the many. And so I'm hoping that we're going to achieve $1,000 a night boutique hotel levels of design, but at $150 price point.So hopefully you see that modern service, you see the incredible design and then things almost never go wrong. The process power that Hamilton Helmer would call it of 15 years of having identified micro issues and identified root causes and implemented system-wide solutions that make the probability of that issue coming back to the system near zero. So I think 15 years into building the business, hopefully, we're really far along these three investment areas that I think are not going to change in the next decade and be truly global brand, be recognized. Sonder is really relatively unknown today, simply because we don't have enough supply to serve. Even the customers that do know us are filling our spaces. And so we're really working hard to multiply the size of the business so that it's almost unrecognizably large pursuing extremely, extremely rapid growth rates over the next seven years so that we can have millions of people stay with us a week after week. Patrick: What does that tech roadmap look like? So it sounds like you understand the stack that needs to be built and you've built some of it. Keyless check-in's a good example. The integration on the phone for so many of the functions that were not great investments, like I love the housekeeping thing. What are the things that are coming soon that you're most excited about or interested in the tech stack specifically? Francis: Messaging and all the investments that could be done within messaging. So maybe messaging is underselling it, it's not just the idea that you can go back and forth and that you can do that with rich media and so on, but that we're going to incorporate features, functions within the messaging interface. So, for example, you're going to say something like, ""Hey, can I extend stay?"" Which, by the way, you can do on the app with a couple taps, but we know that some guests even today will reach out to us or send us an SMS or message us and say, ""Hey, I want to extend my stay."" So instead of redirecting them or doing the work manually, having someone on our team actually change the dates on their behalf, what we're going to do is pop up a calendar inside of the messaging interface and then allow you to just select that date and then complete the payment within that same interface.And likewise for a variety of other features that are present inside of the app, but roll them in with sometimes even a visual UI so that you can complete those tasks by yourself using increasing amounts of natural language processing in order to deliver those kinds of features. So if you message us, ""Hey, I want to extend my stay,"" instead of having someone on our team, push a button that says, ""Hey,"" pop open the calendar so that the guest can then figure out when they want to extend their state until to have that happen in real time automatically. That's what we mean by modern and frictionless service is that without even a human in the loop allow you to, through a messaging interface, complete a lot of the actions that otherwise would require someone to step in, but do so in real time. Patrick: Are there any other trends in hospitality specifically that you think are notable as a result of COVID or that were accelerated by COVID or cut short by COVID that we haven't talked about yet? Obviously Airbnb has been the huge story in this space, but it seems like hotels have been interesting stories as well and I'm sure people's appetite to travel and do new kinds of extended stay travel, for example, like we already talked about are on the rise. Anything else just a way from Sonder just at the hospitality level that you think is exciting and changing and maybe different in the future? Francis: Well, I think that some brands are doing a better job of modernizing their service. And it is a dynamic market. And so that actually motivates us quite a bit to keep innovating really rapidly, but we're seeing some brands announce that housekeeping is going to be by request only instead of being offered as a default in certain brands or sub segments of their brands. We're seeing the importance of offering a completely keyless frictionless contactless check-in experience as something that I know is on the radar of a lot more companies right now. So there's some of these themes that the industry is waking up to and being like, ""Oh yeah, you know what? We are behind and we need to invest some more.""And so there's going to be quite a lot of need in the hospitality industry. What it means for us is that part of our vision that I didn't explain because it doesn't quite relate to the customer experience, but it is meaningful business driver for us will be to white label and offer our suite of software services, what we call the hospitality operating system to other operators and other brands. And so it's going to take us again years in order to really perfect the technology that we're building and even for our own selves. But once we feel really good about what we've done, and we feel like there's substantial areas of innovation and R&D that are ready to be packaged and offered to other companies, we're going to be offering our software tools a little bit like AWS style, build it for your own self, but really within mind the idea that this is something that's going to be appealing for a lot of others as well. Patrick: How do you think about the other segments in the market and whether or not you want to play there? I think I've heard of a company called Inspirato, which as far as I understand it does luxury or higher end variety of different properties that you can get as a member of Inspirato or something. Are there other models in this space that intrigue you and you have on your radar? Francis: There's a lot of players in this space. Even our business model is one that over 10 companies have decided to pursue like a really obvious idea to pursue, and therefore there's a lot of competition for it. I like what I'm seeing on the glamping front and experiences that are almost nature forward, but still with a high degree of consistency and quality. I think I'm seeing the rise of also some boutique brands in Europe and the US, typically ones that are led by someone who's really centric design forward. I think there's a model that's been really great. They've been around for much longer than we have, but there's a lot of innovation going on in a brand like citizenM, there's a lot to learn there based in the Netherlands and they're expanding to the US. There's a lot of interesting models out there and sources of inspiration that we could have. I think what becomes challenging is to reconcile models that really interesting from a guest experience perspective and ones that can really scale from a business perspective. I think the key component there is really the cost optimization and the utilization of technology, the rebuilding of the hospitality technology stack. And if I may add a little on the reason why it's puzzling, why is it that, that hasn't been done? There's really large... There's $100 billion of market cap of companies of hospitality brands. Why is it that they haven't built this technology already?And there's been an interesting shift that occurred in the 90s, mostly where hotel companies used to actually operate and own even the properties that they had under their flags. But then they decided to actually split these companies in half. And on the one side, there was the real estate company, the real estate investment trust. They spun it out. That trades separately. Basically, the hospitality brands that we know today are mostly franchising businesses. And the franchise contracts once you dig under the hood, really what they are is a percentage of revenue contract. They take, call it 15% of top line. There is no incentive in there to ensure that the cost structure is reduced. In fact, if the cost structure is reduced, that means that some of those gains can be passed over to customers that will deteriorate the value of these franchise contracts, because they make a percentage of the top line. So if I cut cost by 50% and I can offer 20% lower price to my customers, that would actually return the negative ROI to whoever would be building that technology and offering it to their franchisees. And so even though it was a really great trick for Wall Street back then, and it did create some value, at least on paper initially, it really caused this technological adoption debt that we think now provides for really, really interesting opportunity that no one's pursuing. Patrick: Well, Francis, that's been so interesting. What a cool business in this... I'll put this category as my friend, Carl Kawaja calls it, The Empire Strikes Back, of older industries that are building tech enabled or tech emphasized businesses in things that, like you said, are not going to change. People are going to want to travel, they're going to want to stay somewhere wonderful and have a really great clean consumer experience. Really enjoyed learning about the journey for you so far. And look forward to watching you as you go public here soon, and hopefully hit some of those 15 year milestones. I ask everybody the same traditional closing question. What is the kindest thing that anyone's ever done for you? Francis: So this is really a funny one. So my girlfriend, she knows me very well. We started dating March 14, 2020, which was perfect timing for COVID I guess. And we've spent every day together since then. And it's been a really wonderful story and she knows me quite well. And she introduced me to Squash a couple months ago. So I started playing Squash, but I'm a beginner, I don't know what I'm doing. It was my birthday a month ago. And she decided to organize a Squash tournament called the Francis games where a bunch of people showed up. And we played a Squash tournament as a beginner against players that were actually quite good.And as a birthday present, I basically got my kicked by every single player at that tournament and finished at the bottom of the pile, but she knew that, that would actually be something that would motivate me quite a lot and I'd found really funny and entertaining. Now, I'm super motivated for Francis games number two, hopefully. If there's a rematch next year, I'll be much better. But I thought that was such nice kindness, because it's unusual and it's unexpected, and she knows that it can be a wonderful gift to get your kicked by good Squash players if you're getting introduced to something new that you're really interested in getting better at. So really was happy to see that. Patrick: Well, Francis, thanks so much. It's so nice to meet you. I appreciate learning everything about your business today. Thanks so much for your time.

306,Niraj Shah - Developing Every Skill,Introduction," Patrick: My guest today is Niraj Shah, the CEO and co-founder of Wayfair. Wayfair started life in 2002 as a collection of independent websites selling category-specific home furniture, but became a one-stop-shop for the home category in 2011 when at 500 million in sales the team consolidated their 240 websites into wayfair.com. Today, the business offers 22 million products from 16,000 suppliers to more than 30 million customers. During our conversation, we discuss how the competitive frontiers in e-commerce have changed, what it was like to build out a proprietary logistics operation, and what makes the home goods market more attractive than other physical goods markets. Please enjoy this great conversation with Niraj Shah.",157
307,Niraj Shah - Developing Every Skill,Supply Chain Issues in 2021," Patrick: So, Niraj, we're going to talk a lot about Wayfair, of course, and its unique, interesting history and the landscape of the business today. But there's a couple bigger picture issues, one topical, one little less so that I'd love to begin with. Those two are the supply chain in the world today, in late 2021, and also sort of the physical goods market more generally speaking, and then we'll get to Wayfair. It's impossible not to ask you this question off the bat given your purview on the world, maybe just give me your impression of the world's supply chain issues today. This feels like something no one's ever thought about until now, and now everyone's thinking about it and talking about it. Niraj: What I would say about supply chain is... Obviously supply chain has always mattered. It's such a big component of the cost of goods. It's such a big component of global trade, and optimizing it certainly has proven to be advantageous for those who've been good at it. I'd say what you're seeing right now is COVID and the events that transpired took everyone by surprise, obviously. At first, the onset of a pandemic, everyone reacted the way you'd expect, which is they worry that demand is going to fall. So the first thing that happened obviously is that COVID started in Asia and so production got slowed, but then as it appeared in the Western world, everyone gets worried demand's going to fall. So all of a sudden, people are cutting orders. Then the opposite happens. People are at home, and demand actually does the opposite. They can't spend money on entertainment or services, they spend it on goods, and demand just goes through the roof. You say in hindsight, it's obvious, but the truth is it was unexpected by almost everybody. So all of a sudden there's been this race to catch up, folks ordering goods and wanting to get them into the countries in the Western world.Then the basic problem is the amount of shipping capacity that's there is kind of a fixed amount. The reality is, whether it be a port in China shutdown for a few weeks to prevent COVID cases from spreading, or whether it be backlogs in Port of Long Beach or wherever, all it does is cut down on the amount of capacity. Because if a ship sits idle for 20 days, that's the one trans-specific sailing, that one leg of it that needs to get canceled. You have this scenario where everyone's trying to catch up to this elevated demand. It'll correct itself, but if demand stays high, it's just going to take a long time. That's kind of what folks are seeing. Folks like us who have some control of their logistics, where we have our own fulfillment centers, and we started our own ocean-forwarding business a few years ago, you have some cards to play, but at the end of the day, you're still in the same boat with everyone else in the sense that there's finite capacity. Patrick: If we think about the supply chain as the place something gets made, it's got to get to a boat, it's got to ride the boat, it's got to get offloaded at a port, get onto another truck into a center, into someone's home. Where in that chain is the world the most interesting or problematic to you today? Niraj: The acute problem is in the ocean leg because that's where the capacity is constrained. There's plenty of finished goods sitting in the places where they're made right now, and there's plenty of capacity in the location where you store near the customer. But that ocean leg is super constrained. Other parts of transportation are a little tight, but the ocean leg is what's super constrained. In general, if I zoom out and talk about the future, I think the leg that's the most interesting is the final mile leg to the customer, but right now that's not really where the biggest pain is. Patrick: And so if we think about the ocean leg as being onloading, riding, and offloading the ports and the ship itself, how does that resolve itself? How long does it take to build a ship? You see these aerial shots of the ships waiting off the port on the west coast of the US is this other problem. Just maybe zooming in on the ports and the ships themselves, how do you think this gets resolved? Niraj: One specific thing in the United States, there was announcement this week that some ports are going to start operating 24 by 7. They have not been... In Europe and Asia, they've been operating 24 by 7 for many, many years, and so that's common. So if you think about it, if you operate the port twice as many hours as you were, you're going to move goods twice as fast. Patrick: Pretty good. Yeah. Niraj: Yeah. And to be honest, when you operate them at night, goods move even faster because trucks can get in and out easier because there's no traffic in the middle of the night. Whereas obviously during the day there's traffic. So I think something like that helps. I do think the other thing that's going to help is while we're not in a post-COVID world, we're headed there. You're seeing travel picking up, you're seeing entertainment... I think goods' demand will slow over time back to a more normal place and folks will be building up their inventory back to a more normal place, and so this will take some of the edge off as well.",1229
308,Niraj Shah - Developing Every Skill,The Physical Goods Market," Patrick: If we kind of zoom back to the physical goods market, not so much acutely in this period, but just more generally speaking, when we first connected you gave me this awesome taxonomy overview, if you will, of what the physical goods market globally looks like. Maybe you could do that for the audience here. I was kind of surprised by some of the percentages and some of the nuance, and that'll also be the bridge to get into ",101

310,Niraj Shah - Developing Every Skill,Building A Well Rounded Athlete," Patrick: The specialist focus thing is so interesting given that you've already done a lot of that, but you're still only 2% of the overall market. So it seems like with so much market share space to eat up, you can continue this long term thinking around how you invest and build up the infrastructure. So where does that lead us? Obviously, you're some part of the way through getting your own logistics network set up, but what are the other areas of interest to you as a capital allocator, as you think about going from 2% to 10% to 20% market share or whatever it might be, what are the key drivers do you think of investment opportunity for Wayfair? Niraj: Logistics is obviously one, we talked a lot about that, but I mentioned a couple times, this notion of helping the customer find the perfect item. If you break that down, one aspect of that is having the most selection available because if you have the selection available, you've done this thing that hasn't been done before, which is you've amassed this world selection, brought it to a customer for them to choose, but then you've made their job very difficult. How do they navigate this huge selection? Because it can be overwhelming. On one hand, get the huge selection, then make it navigable, shopable in a fun and inspiring and easy way for the customer. And then help them understand what the item is well enough that they have confidence in buying that, whether that's... Our user reviews are not just text reviews, but customers upload photos of the actual item in their house. And we collect a lot of information that others may not ask about. Or for example, we scan the digital fabric. We scan the fabrics, have digital versions of it that we'll offer. If you want, we'll mail you textile fabrics so you can actually feel the fabric of an item. Or what we're investing into, because a lot of where we're headed has a lot to do with the technology that we've been investing in, is we're probably one of the world's largest leaders in building 3D models. And with the 3D models, we then today, render virtually all of the imagery we have. But in addition to that, you can then picture the item in your house. You have a thousand dollars computer in your pocket, so you pull out your phone and you can then see the item placed in the room that you would then have it in.And then there's some things that are still very much R&D, which is, we have a screen here in the office where you can rub your hand over a fabric and you feel the fabric. You feel it as if you're rubbing your hand over the fabric. Today on your phone, with some of the haptic sensors, you know you get some tactile feedback, but it's pretty crude relative to what you need to feel the fabric. That screen around the office costs $5,000, and it uses battery power that you can't put on a phone today. But now fast forward, think about what's happening in battery power on a phone. Think about what happens to the cost of these components as the years go by. And so what's going to happen is the device you have is going to become more and more powerful with the camera and the haptic responses in it. And so one of the things we've done is we've been building our own technology. We have 3,500 people in the company that are software engineers and data scientists and product managers and designers, building these technology experiences. And so while our customer doesn't necessarily think of us as someone who's investing heavily into technology to make their experience better, the reason why the logistics network can work the way it is or the way the product discovery and merchandising can work the way it does or suppliers can do the things they can do on our platform or et cetera, is because of our investments in technology. And so I think this will continue to unlock customer benefits, which will unlock repeat. Today, 76% of our orders are repeat orders and it just drives this virtuous fire wheel where customers are happy, so they come back more often. They tell others about us.We keep investing in making the experience better, which makes the next set of customers have an even better experience, which causes them to come back. And we keep going in that cycle in partnership with our suppliers on every axis. So we've talked a lot about what we're doing, logistics or what we're doing in merchandising or with suppliers, with selection. And we're also doing this with how we integrate with our partners. We're doing this with how our marketing, we built most of our own technology for our marketing and advertising. We're one of the largest advertisers in the United States and that gets us reach to tell customers the stories that draw them in. And so we just have this view that eCommerce is around being the well rounded athlete, so no one area makes up for the next area. So how do we have an ambitious plan in each area, invest into it and do things with the benefit of technology that others are not doing while always making sure these things are customer aligned. Patrick: You've obviously had a lot of history in the area of marketing. You just mentioned that as a key area, that you spent a lot of money and you had this fascinating multi website background and advertising on the web or digital marketing, I guess is the way I would put it. What does excellent marketing mean to you? And this is both a curiosity in the context of Wayfair, like how you developed what you view as excellent internally, but also just as a curious businessperson looking at other people doing marketing really well in the modern world. What is excellent? What are the dimensions of excellent marketing today in 2021? Niraj: There's a few different pieces. That's sort of like a multi-level answer because at the first standpoint, you need to understand what is it that you're offering customers and you need to tell them that story. So if you want to have a household brand, the brand, it needs to stand for something and it needs to be a promise you're going to put out there and telling that story in a way that connects with customers that helps them understand what it is you're telling them. And be curious enough to check you out, is really important. Say most folks have seen Wayfair commercials, they've heard the Wayfair jingle and over time they've associated us as this fun and lovable home retailer that offers wide selection with great value and convenience. And so I think there's the marketing that needs to tell that story and needs to continue to add detail to it, to add preference and understanding. Today with marketing, the old adage where, I know half my advertising spend is wasted, I just don't know which half. I think the days for that have been left behind. So today you can basically, with very complex data science models, take in all the input, whether it be the television spend you have, or we send hundred of millions of pieces of direct mail ranging from postcards, to flyers, to catalogs.And knowing about those to what we do online, where we're a very large online advertiser. And you could basically take all that data and understand what impact each piece had on a customer to basically put back into what makes sense and what doesn't make sense to do, which for certain things, it comes down to like how many cents you would bid on an impression for that given customer. And in some sense comes down to like, oh, which customers would you put on the mailing list for this catalog or not? And maybe you put them on for a different catalog. Maybe you put them on for every catalog. Maybe they'd only meet for the holiday catalog. You could do that very quantitatively. So I think there's an element where you need to have technology that's both powering how your online marketing works, as well as the data science model to understand attribution. But then the brand marketing is as relevant as ever and you need to be great at that and telling that story, whether it be through television or through influencers or through the variety of methods that are out there. So I think you're taking the old aspects of marketing that mattered, and you're adding this technology powered capability set and you need both. No one sort of covers off for the other. Patrick: Is there another business whose marketing story you most respect? Niraj: One who did both aspects incredibly well and continues to reinforce that cycle is Netflix. So Netflix understood the performance marketing, grew up with that. That's the same way we grew up, originally it was a performance marketing quantitative marketing piece. But as they wanted to become a household brand, they really understood all the aspects of brand marketing and how to convey and communicate that. And in their case, part of how they do that has to do with what content they support and develop. And they sort of understood that that is not just the product, but that's also the brand and the marketing. Look at how they've developed overtime. I think anyone would be hard pressed not to hold that in high regard. Patrick: I'd love to then understand a little bit more about like literally the nuts and bolts of the business itself and how it works. I spend so much time talking to software businesses or pure technology businesses that have very different margin profiles and therefore operate their businesses very differently. I'd love you to discuss just the margin profile of the business. What is the gross margin? What is the operating margin and what are the major components of that equation? Because obviously those then become levers for improving the business over time. And if you're building this infrastructure, sounds to me like leverage. Like it's a lot of fixed cost investment that's happening, which can then create a lot of operational leverage in the future. So what is the margin profile of the business look like today? What are the major components? How has it evolved? Niraj: In order to keep the value proposition very clean and to be able to do all the things for our customer we want to do, we basically set the retail prices ourselves, and we do a lot of the value of the value chain. When you do that, you basically account for the GMV becomes your revenue. And what's interesting is if we were a marketplace, we just said, oh, we're just purely a marketplace. Because really, if you look at the supply cyber business, we are a marketplace. You would actually not account for the GMV as your revenue. You would only look at the gross profit as your revenue. So one of the issues is, is a little bit of like an optical illusion, which I'll talk about in a second. And so the GMV is our revenue, and then in cost of goods, we have the cost of the product and the cost of the transportation all the way through delivering to the customer. And that gets you to the gross margin line. And our gross margin in recent periods has been around 28%. And we've talked a lot about how there's still a long runway on how can rise, be it savings from logistics, the savings from a lot of the things that gain efficiency on our platform, the savings from some of the things we're doing in merchandising to add value. Mentioned the $104 share, could be $106 and not lose any demand. And so gross margin is at 28% but rising. Then we have customer service. We have a large customer service for thousands of people and we pay the credit card interchange merchant fees. The two together are about 4%, so about two and two, round numbers. That's 4% after that and that gets to what we'd call the variable contribution margin. So to say, that would be around 24%. And after that you have like two primary costs, you have the cost of the team of people. The folks in customer service or the folks in the logistics operation.Logistics within the cost of goods and folks customer service were in that line, I just mentioned. But you have the cost of the corporate team. And we have a large corporate team today, I mentioned the 3,500 people building technology. Well, there's another 3,500 or so who are doing everything from running the marketing as we talked about, to the merchandising organization, to finance, et cetera. So that you have the OPEX line, and the other line you have is the advertising line, which I referenced. So what happens over time is your advertising keeps going down because repeat orders keep rising. And your repeat customer is highly profitable because if you think about it, once I know you and our average customers spend $450 a year, customers spend more money in each successive year. And if you think about your home spend on average for our average customer, home spend is $3,000 to $4,000 a year. So our 450 is still pretty low relative to potential. And so what happens is when we don't know you, we're spending the first years worth of contribution margin to find you and for you to buy. But year two, once we know you, if you think about it, I can smear you a catalog for a dollar. I can put a display out in front of you on the internet for 10 cents. So I can actually be marketing to you fairly heavily and still be spending a very finite amount of money. When I look at it as a percentage of revenue, it gets pretty low. Advertising keeps falling as you're growing revenue per customer per year and as you're growing the repeat percentage. The OPEX head count gets leveraged because even though you're growing that team, the revenue growth gives you leverage there. And then I mentioned the gross margin can rise for the reasons I cited.So what happens is, we used to say that the long term EBITDA profile was 8% to 10%. During COVID, we showed that our U.S business, which is more mature than the international segment was already getting EBITDA profitability in that range. And so what we did recently is we updated it, we didn't give numbers this time, but we basically pointed out that it can be substantially higher than that. Now what's interesting is if we were a marketplace, if you took that 28%, you said that's going to be higher. And then you take 8% to 10% and you make that higher. Well, even if it was 8% to 10% out of 28%, all of a sudden you'd say we were 40% margin business. So it'll look a lot like a software business. What we're going to say is the 8% to 10%, which is now going to be much higher, but off of the 100%. The margin looks lower, but actually your investment capability is actually identical. The reality is you're just tackling more of the cost structure because you're going to address the cost of goods and the shipping by being proactive in managing that. But the reality is the profit profile, which is how much money can I make off my take rate or my gross margin piece is actually looks a lot like it would in any of these digital businesses. But the execution piece is more complicated because you need to make all the physical operations work in addition to the technical operations, because having just great software alone wouldn't let you function well if your supply chain didn't work. Or wouldn't let your function of your customer service organization didn't work. And so we view e-commerce as that well-rounded athlete business for that reason, but we also view that as a competitive advantage, because getting good at everything is just frankly, it's a difficult business. Patrick: I mean, I love the well rounded athlete concept, process power concept. Like any great business, it's just complicated. There's no magic bullet, you have to do a lot of things very well. In that environment, there's also a lot of surface area for, I guess, things to go wrong. So how do you think about lessons learned from major mistakes in the business through history? What stand out as the few things that have gone the most wrong or decisions that turned out to be bad ones that were productive in the sense that you learned from them? Niraj: We encourage folks to take risks. And one stories I would say is like, look in a traditional company, larger company, you sort of don't want to be the person where something doesn't work. What do you do? You do two things a year. You don't do them until they're going to work. You make sure they're going to work well. Sure enough. Both of the things you do work well, no failure associated with you. You got done the two things you promised you would. Hey, look, we want you to try five things. Well, what's the upside? Well, four of the five things works, so you'd be like, oh, great, okay. So your upside is that twice as many things worked, I say, well, actually, that's the second best benefit, the best benefits is actually the fifth one, the one that didn't work. And the reason that's the best one is we have this really bright person who we put in charge of some area of the business. And we go out of our way, we have a recruiting team of 400 people. We put a tremendous amount of effort into finding the most amazing people and having a place where they want to stay. So now this really bright person that owns one area of the business, they're convinced all five are going to work. It's the only reason they tried it. And so the one that didn't work, there's something about it that they didn't know, that they now got to learn.So every decision they'll make now is now informed by this one new piece of information they just picked up, which lets them make better decisions tomorrow. And so, because we use data to measure everything, learning is a key piece of making things better and better. And the way you learn is from what doesn't work, you don't really learn from what worked. Culture, I think is a big advantage. And what it means though, is to pull it off to your point about the complexity, you really need two key things. One, you need just the most amazing, talented people that exist out there, which means you need to look really hard for them. You need to tell the story as to why they want to join. They want to work with other people like them. They won't want to work in a place that has a great culture. So you got to go find them and retain them. And the second thing that you need is you need a culture that empowers them and helps them, rather than inhibits them and creates frustration for them. And so we say, if you invest in your people, invest in your culture. And by the way, invest in your culture means protecting your culture because it will devolve over time if you let it. Those two things end up being your advantages, and you're going to be competing against other companies that understand what the customer wants and understand the product offering, just like you do, but you're going to be able to help execute them, if you focus on those two things.",4088
311,Niraj Shah - Developing Every Skill,Culture & Constant Improvement," Patrick: What does it mean to invest in culture? Like the culture entropy thing rings very true for me, that it's just something that needs to constantly be fed and nurtured. And it's really more about what you do repeatedly than what you say, like on a wall of values or something. How do you think about deliberately investing time or dollars into culture? Niraj: So we've rewritten how we express our culture in words three times in the history of the business. And we haven't actually changed what we believe in, but we've gotten better at writing it down, and crisp spinning it. It's on our website, you can read it. It's our people principles. And it talks about these nine principles under these three pillars. And we try to get really crisp with the language, so it was very hard to misunderstand what we were saying. And the whole reason is we want to attract people who are attracted to that and we want to operate that way because that's what we believe. And so what we do during recruiting someone, we basically have a set of folks who are evaluating them along the axis of skill fit. And we have another set of folks who are evaluating along the axis culture fit. And the way we do that is we break down each of those principles and assign them to different of the interviewers to basically evaluate the person on just that lens. Then when someone's here, we invest a lot into telling people about the people principles, why they matter.I do a session with new managers during their first 90 days where I talk about what the people principles mean to me, and then just do a Q&A with them answering their questions. And then what we do in our performance review cycle is we review folks against the people principles. So we take the people principles, and that's what you're rated against because it's what we care about. I forget what the quote is, but something about you can't get the good outcome. If you don't measure it. There's a tighter adage, but I'm getting it wrong. But that concept. Well, this is what we care about, so let's measure folks against it. And by the way, if someone doesn't understand one or how do we coach folks on it and how do we help them build those skills, how do we educate them? And because if you're getting the best folks, you want to continue to develop them as well. And so we believe a lot in that in people and culture. Patrick: One of those nine is adapt and grow. Again, is something that I think everyone that's thoughtful aspires to. Get better personally, get better as a team. If you're using those nine things as the language through which to evaluate someone in a review, how do you evaluate that one specifically? That seems like right next to it is innovate and improve, which is adjacent and probably some similar overlapping concepts. But drilling all the way down to the performance review, how do you decide if someone has done those two things effectively, adapt and grow and innovate and improve? Niraj: We have two to three sentences under each one that tries to give you a little more about what each one's angling to go after. But if you think about those two, what we're trying to say is part of being successful to the maximum degree is whether you want to call the concept of being a lifelong learner or being flexible and willing to change in the face of new information and new data. So some of that's a culture mindset around not being stubborn and basically being open and always paying attention and being curious, keeping your eyes open, asking questions. And then part of it's your own ambition. Are you an active participant on that journey, or are you just pushed when you have to? When we find the folks we want, they're ambitious and driven, they're ambitious and driven on multiple vectors, not just around the business performance, not just around their own career admission and responsibility set, but around learning many axis. And the mental headset, in addition to exemplifying behaviors, in addition to investing your time in that manner, all these aspects of it matter. Patrick: The concept of constant improvement is a nice one, but it seems like a hard one to accurately measure all the time. Sometimes improvement happens in jumps, more discrete, non continuous fashion. So it's always interesting to me how people handle that. For you personally, if we apply that lens to you, what are the things where you get the most joy out of those discreet improvements in how you're operating as a CEO or as a leader, or just as part of the Wayfair story? How would you measure your own improvement over time? Where have you been best and what have you most enjoyed getting better at? Niraj: I'd say the thing that when we started and for a long time, that you could kind of keep your arms around every area of the business. I'm very detail oriented. I like knowing what's going on. What you learn over time is you need to let go. And there's this concept of what's the right level to hover at? Because on one hand, you need to know what's going on. On the other hand, if you try to hover too deep, there are not enough hours in the day, or you're going to impede the team's ability to just own the topic and drive it forward. And so I would say the biggest thing that I've learned is a combination of, from a management practice standpoint, how do you do that? How do you hover at the right level? And then as you get bigger, you realize not everyone works the same way as everyone else and you're getting a larger and larger organization. And you basically also need to learn to modulate your style. And so what I found was when I was younger and we were smaller, you're a hammer and everything's a nail, same approach on everything. And what you learn over time is that's not actually the optimal way to do it. It takes more effort. You have to be more mindful and you need to gain more skills if you want to modulate that. And I would say that's actually, in the recent year, something I put more energy into because I'd say for the longest time I didn't do that. And then you notice sometimes you get better outcomes in some conversations and some interactions than others. And rather than say, ""Oh, the other person should adapt to me,"" the truth is on one hand, sure, you hope they do that and why shouldn't you also try to do the same thing and then you're going to maximize the odds of the outcome? Patrick: Early on in the company's trajectory, usually competition isn't all that important. If you're doing something new and interesting, blue ocean, not a red ocean, and you don't have to think too much about your competition. As a business matures, you have to do that a lot more. And I'm curious what you've learned about that dimension of leadership and thinking and steering a company. I think famously, Amazon had a Wayfair parity project or something that they wanted to match you in certain aspects and their online furniture sales are serious too, like yours are. So maybe they're the obvious one to ask about, Amazon. But just generally speaking, how do you think about competition and whether you should keep your eye on the prize of what you're trying to do versus look on your flanks as you get bigger to see what others in the same space are doing? Niraj: In my experience, it's important to be cognizant of what your competitors are doing because good ideas can come from anywhere. You certainly want to be aware of what they're doing. But in general, the success, I think, comes from not obsessing over your competitors, but rather obsessing over your customers and understanding what your customers like. What's going well today? What's not going well? What are the set of improvements that'll matter the most for our customers? How do we make those things happen? Perhaps it's something novel we need to do, or we need to create something or innovate on something. And that's really where you're going to get the gains. Your competitor, in theory, is trying to do that too. But if you are more focused on the customer and move with more ambition and speed and take on bigger challenges and are successful with that, you're going to outpace them. And so my view is you should watch your competitors and be aware, but the truth is what really matters more is how you pay attention and work on what matters for your customers. Patrick: As you think back on the whole Wayfair journey to this point, what episode for you personally was the most stressful? So what happened in this period of time for the business that just had you the most stressed out or emotionally exhausted, and what do you take from that episode as a lesson? Niraj: I typically don't get stressed out if something's going wrong if it's in our control, because my view is all right, well, do we believe in our plan? Do we have the right people working on it? Okay, let's work at it and you can get the outcomes you want. Things will get better. When things are out of your control is when you tend to worry more. And so the most stressful period, earlier, we chatted a little bit about the early story of the 250 websites and the migration of wayfair.com. And in that period, we had 250 websites that were well honed in how we were doing the online marketing for them and search engine placement. Everything about it had gotten dialed in over the years. Well, when we launched wayfair.com, you have this new site, it has no traffic. Then you have these old sites that have the traffic. And so you need to shut down the old sites and do permanent redirects to this new site. And the problem is no matter how good your new site is, day one of this new site, someone is not going to feel like they... If they visited us at racks they're at a bespoke store for TV stands, or if they visited us at oldbarstools.com, they're a bespoke store for bar stools. Now they're in Wayfair. Wayfair doesn't have the same visual merchandising it has today. It doesn't have the same brand it has today. There's this thing called Wayfair. They don't know what that is. They're in some bar stool or TV stand department page, which probably is far from being optimal. And so what happens is you permanently do these redirects and your conversion doesn't start where it was. And then on top of that, you lose all your natural search traffic.And in particular, our natural search traffic, we kept redirecting tranches of sites and it wasn't recovering and we couldn't figure out why it wasn't recovering. And so our traffic at one point was down fairly substantially. It was obviously the source of some stress. Now over time, we figured out some technical things that were inhibitors. We also figured some improvements that we made to Wayfair that continued to drive up performance and obviously where it is today is many, many, many times bigger than it was then, that was definitely a stressful period because it felt like there was a portion that was out of our control and it wasn't always super clear during that period, and this period lasted over a year, of what to do. And so the lesson though, is what we did is we just kept working at it, kept trying to figure it out, kept going back to maybe not being confident that we knew what was happening, why it was happening, but kept tearing it back down different ways. Entirely confident we didn't yet know exactly what was happening, why it was happening and so we needed to keep digging. And perseverance and being tenacious, I think, is a part of every entrepreneur's story at some point. And when you hear these stories, Phil Knight wrote this book called Shoe Dog, it's a story of Nike from when he started it until they went public. So it actually doesn't talk about the last couple decades and it ends when they went public. It's a great book. And you realize that today, you think of Nike as this dominant company, footwear and sports apparel space. And when you read it, you realize that there's just many turns where it could have just gone away, gone out of business. And I think that's part of almost every entrepreneur's journey, is this notion of having to be tenacious, keep working at things, figuring things out. There's twists and turns, things happen that you don't know. If you're just willing to call it quits, then you're never going to get there. Patrick: If we think to the future now, obviously you built something huge and substantial that's very recognizable. So distinct from that episode, I love that episode you just described. If you think five, 10 years in the future and put your rose colored glasses on, what do you think the rot version of this story becomes over that period of time for Wayfair? Niraj: What's exciting is we have a household brand. That's great. Patrick: It's hard to do, yeah. Niraj: We're still very far from potential because we can become the customer's go-to brand for all things home and we can get them to where they define home as broadly as we do. It's not just furniture. It's not just decor. It's not just housewares. It's not just appliances. It's not just home improvement, it's all of that and we can provide that in an experience, in a manner that they can't get anywhere else, whether that's the way we provide design advice or the way we help them with decisioning or the content we can provide or the visual merchandising or the fast delivery. I think through that journey, what's going to happen, we've been growing at a rate where we double every two to three years, we think that can continue for a long time to come. If you think about the concept of 2% market share and you just double that every two to three years, you can see why that could continue for a while. And we get excited about that prospect of getting that outcome through the vehicle, basically making customers happier and happier by giving them this ideal experience that they've had in their head, but doesn't exist in the world. Patrick: Well, this has been so much fun. I think that the business is fascinating. I've been on a run of thinking through these just complicated, big global businesses and how things are changing in technology, a 3,500 person team devoted to things like technology is so cool in a business that's about home furnishings and decor, et cetera. I've learned a ton and I really enjoy talking to you just like last time and just learning a lot about what you built and how you've built it. I ask the same closing question of everybody, what is the kindest thing that anyone's ever done for you? Niraj: Patrick, I've listened to your podcast. And so I would say that I'm aware of you asking that question and I was thinking about my answer before this. And unfortunately, I have to say my is going to prove to not be a novel one because, as I've heard many folks credit the kind of support and encouragement that their parents gave them and I've heard many folks do the same with regards to their spouse, those are the same folks I would go to. And my parents were super supportive when I told them I did not want to attend graduate school and I wanted to be an entrepreneur, which my parents were first generation immigrants from India and education was the de-risk path to success. Graduate school was a step on that journey and I chose not to do that. And obviously hindsight, whatever. It worked out just fine, but they were very supportive. They never even blinked an eye and that was the whole experience through my youth. And then my wife is an amazing person, we've been married 18 years. And I have to say similarly, entirely supportive, including sometimes a personal sacrifice of her. So I have to say that I don't have a novel answer for you, but that's my answer, and I'm happy with it. Patrick: Well look, I think for those of us that can give that answer, in many ways, it'd be mine too. What a great piece of luck and privilege for that. I don't mind the common answer at all. It's a fantastic one. I wish everyone could answer it that way to some extent. Really, again, appreciate the time and all the insight today. Niraj: Well, thank you.

312,Eric Golden - Bored Ape Yacht Club,Introduction," Patrick: Welcome to our new show Web3 Breakdowns. We want to be your on ramp into this new decentralized world and through conversations with builders, creators, and investors, we'll do our best to help you understand and navigate this emerging ecosystem.First up, we are breaking down the NFT project and cultural phenomenon Bored Ape Yacht Club. To help break down Bored Apes, I'm joined by Eric Golden, former portfolio manager at Fidelity and current Bored Ape owner. Eric and I start with an overview of the Bored Ape Yacht Club and his path to owning an NFT in the collection. We then use Bored Apes as a lens to understand how NFT projects are not just creating rare art, but strong membership communities too. Beyond the cultural differences between NFT communities, it was fascinating to hear how projects are differentiating themselves with IP ownership, roadmaps, and dows. Please enjoy this breakdown of the Bored Ape Yacht Club.",218
313,Eric Golden - Bored Ape Yacht Club,What Bored Ape Yacht Club Is," Patrick: So Eric, we like to begin these things with just a simple overview of what the thing is. In this case, we're going to talk about the Bored Ape Yacht Club, my personal favorite example of just the madness and interestingness in the crypto world today. It's not a company, so usually we do companies, but we'll start the same way here with Bored Apes. Can you just give us a high level overview of like, what is this thing literally? Give us a couple numbers, a little bit of history. What is the Bored Ape Yacht Club? And then we'll dive into all the interesting details beneath the top level surface stuff. Eric: Thank you for having me. I'm glad you started off laughing because I can tell you this is going to be a little bit different than tearing apart a cashflow producing company. So the Bored Ape Yacht Club is a generative art collection in the space of PFP, which stands for profile picture. It started in April 21st is when the project came into being and sold out around May.What these things are, are fun. 10,000 pictures of bored apes that have 170 different characteristics from spinner hats to gold fur, and each one of them is unique but part of the collection called the Bored Ape Yacht Club. Patrick: And if you think about the collection, so there's 10,000 of them. They're NFTs. People collect one or more of them. What are the motivations for owning one that are distinct from let's say a pure piece of art that you might show people but doesn't have a membership criteria to it. Like how is this something more, something different? Eric: So if you zoom out, I think for me of how I got into this, this is not what I thought I would be owning. I got into crypto late. And by late, I mean everyone who was after 2013, that seems to be a big demarcation. And so I was into crypto in 2018, 2019, and I was buying it to coins. I really didn't know much about it. But went on Twitter, most of the information was coming from Twitter and Discord. And on Twitter you would see these CryptoPunks, and I really wanted a CryptoPunk, and you would go in their Discord, and I was lusting after these things. I was looking at them and saying like, ""I just want one."" But when I went into the Discord and I met these people, they'd been in Bitcoin since like 2010, they own Glitz. They just knew everything. And I felt like such an imposter. I was like, ""I'm new to space. I'm just trying to get skin in the game to understand it."" And I really didn't feel like I would belong.And so when the Bored Ape project happened, it had come right after Top Shot. So Top Shot came out at the end of '19. I got big into that in the beginning of 2020, and people were trading basketball cards, and it really was this first experience with NFTs and Roham Gharegozlou, the founder of Dapper Labs, gets a huge amount of credit of onboarding us into what is an NFT.And so at that point, ironically in April, Larva Labs was about to issue their second project called Meebits, and I actually bought two of those. And I thought it was the most ridiculous thing I could ever do. I minted a human and a pig. A pig was very rare, and I showed my wife and I'm like, look, we just minted a digital cartoon and parents of a new pig. And I'm like, you can trade this thing for like $30,000. This whole thing crazy. And I put it up as my avatar, and I was trying to make this personality and just play around in the space. And the Apes were like taunting me. And they were this new project. They started off at $200. Meebits came out at like the equivalent of $8,000.And so this was kind of a blue collar project that it had a vibe and a culture I wanted to be a part of. And so I ended up buying some Bored Apes and joining the group and joining the Discord and learning more about it. And I would say for a lot of people, especially I bought it in May, so it was a one month after launch. It was kind of this silly thing, which was like, we wanted to be punks, but we weren't punks. And we bought this picture of an ape, and it was this fun lore of what would happen if everyone got rich from investing in crypto, what you end up doing, you would create this really cool bar and club to go hang out with your friends, which resonated with a lot of people. Like you're working really hard. You want to make a lot of money, but what's it all for? It's just to go hang out with your friends.And so this culture war started between Meebits and Apes, and we were joking about it, what group you were going to join. It was all very playful and fun. We were watching the price of their project, which is quoted in floors. So floor is the cheapest you can buy something at. There's was two ETH, and ours was 0.3ETH, and we're like, ""Someday we're going to cost more than Meebits."" And we would just joke about it in the Discord and talk about what this project could be. And so it really wasn't on buying a piece of art. I think this is beautiful. I want to hang it on my wall, although I did really like it. It was more symbolic of joining a community and having a shared belief of the people who were on the frontier that are willing to fail unconventionally, but came into crypto around the same time.We weren't the CryptoPunks. We weren't the first to get there, but we were totally okay with that. We were this new group that really wanted to have fun and teach each other. There's another famous podcast that always asks what's the kindest thing. And I really felt like the Bored Ape Yacht Club exemplified that. When you went into the Discord, you're like, ""I don't know what DeFi is. What is Solana and why do all the VCs own it?"" It was just this amazing sharing community where with my ape, I could speak in a way that immediately got me into a circle of people I wanted to associated with and I wanted to learn from. And it was really a club, not a piece of art where I was going to say, I own this rare thing. I'm going to hang on my wall. Patrick: It's a really helpful backstory because I think so much of what's interesting about this project in particular, but maybe NFTs writ larger is the community function. That all of a sudden these digital assets, these scarce digital assets, become membership cards, like a unique brand of membership card. And I'd love you to talk through that in a little bit more detail.So first I want to flesh out there's 10,000 of these things you said. I think there's 170 attributes. Just give people a sense of the scope today. Like, what is the price for today? How much should they get traded? Is there a lot of turnover in them? What the hierarchy of rarity? What's the spread between the cheapest and the most expensive, and how is that determined? Like just a little more meat on the bones of the hierarchy. Because I think these details are the things that the community latches onto as things to talk about, and it's like watching sports or something, right? It's the detail that makes it come to life. So give us a little bit more of that detail Eric: Today, there's been 15 ape sales. I watch it pretty closely. Ironically, we couldn't be recording this at a better time because the record was just broken that a Trippy. If you look at it online, it's an ape fur that looks like a hippy trippy tie dye skin, with a crown and heart sunglasses just sold for $2.7 million. Now that's unusual. I mean, it's actually not last week. We had two mutant sales, which we'll get into which each went for 1.4 million. But today the cheapest ape you can buy where it's just 35ETH, but based on each price action, that's about $140,000 to $150,000 give or take. So that's the cheapest you can get.There are bids for over 1,000ETH on some of the gold, the rarest apes, and the most desired. And so I would say people looked at the class system that I developed with CryptoPunks, where you had aliens, which were the rarest of the rare and then different levels. And so you've got this, a lot of the ways these PFPs start to price, you can think of a pricing curve as there's a floor, which means generic, nothing special, and then there's a mid, and then there's a steep function for the rarest ones. And so those ones go from at this point, now we're talking about multiple millions of dollars for one of these things. Patrick: And if you think about the activity that this distribution of rarity creates in the community, talk to me a little bit about that. Like how does that matter, and why does it matter other than like bragging rights or status signaling and maybe that's the whole function. Eric: So these prices have gotten astronomically high very quickly. If I rewind back to the fun part, there was a cheetah fur and a DMT fur, and the DMT fur is this psychedelic fur. And they started these gangs called the cheetah gang versus the DMT gang. And like we're all for the, I mean there's some teenagers, everyone's anonymous for the most part. So it's a wide group of people.But like the cheetah gang was threatening the DMT gang, and so you kind of have these like subgroups established. And then they would create their own Discord. So I'm part of a Discord called the Rare Apes Club, which is club owners that own some of either they own a collection of apes where they own a bunch of them that equal a significant investment, and or they own some of these rare ones. And the reason why that's helpful is a lot of the largest transactions are happening between counterparties that are off OpenSea.If you listed on the exchange, maybe it will get priced there. But a lot of their rare age will trade amongst the group of people who know that they want to sell something for several million dollars. This is still early to give you numbers. I just saw Galaxy's report, and I think they have OpenSea has 70,000 active daily wallets. So people have quoted the space at 300,000, but you have 70,000 people doing this or at least wallets using it, the amount of people that are going to spend $2.7 million on a rare ape is a small universe right now. And so for trades like that to happen, you really need to know who is the buyer base who would actually want to collect something like this?",2481
314,Eric Golden - Bored Ape Yacht Club,Community Owned Roadmap," Patrick: Let's talk now about the value of holding these things beyond the purely digital. They release this thing called Roadmap 2.0, and again, I want to come back to, there's a difference between owning a piece of art, say in the extreme you own the Mona Lisa, that's incredibly valuable. Maybe it appreciates over time. It's a piece of culture. There's all sorts of interesting art specific angles that we'll probably cover more in other episodes. But in this one I'm really interested in sort of the membership and community specific angle. So how is this organically, this roadmap managed, how does the community contribute to it? Are you excited about it? What do you think this might become if each of these 10,000 things is effectively like a membership card into a club? Eric: Roadmap 1.0 was a scavenger hunt where we were going to give away an ape and also a certain amount of ETH. So the first Roadmap was pretty basic, but the big finale was releasing of the mutant apes, which really was a way of extending the club. So if there was 10,000 people that were part of the original, they had always planned to make that number in total 30,000. But was we really fascinating was the way they went about distributing the second batch of the 20,000. And what was interesting about it is most of the wealth of the money paid for those mutants went to original owners, and some went to the Bored Ape Yacht Club founders themselves.So there was this economic thing where they delivered to original holders Serum, and that Serum, if you combined it with your ape, would create a new mutant ape, and then you could sell that. But you got that for free. The value of that the day it was dropped in U.S. dollars was between 15 and $60,000. So everyone who owned an ape just got 15 to $60,000. And that came on the heels of us already getting a Bored Ape dog, which we could have sold for probably 15 to 20,000.And so if you were in early, you've been paid back your investment already through the airdrop mechanisms, which we can talk about some more. What the Bored Ape Yacht Club itself raised, the actual founders raised something like $90 million in that second sale. Combine that with the fact that one of the interesting things about how NFTs sell is every time a transaction happens, the Bored Ape Yacht Club gets 2.5 per percent and a royalty. So if you have a million dollar sale, you have $25,000 going into the kitty. And so these numbers are wild, but since April, they've done over a billion dollars in sales and raised over a hundred million dollars in revenue for this organization to do what it will with.And so you asked the question, there's kind of two parts. One thing that made Bored Apes unique was they let the owners take the IP. So I own my ape. I can start a beer company, a coffee company. We can start the Bored Investor Yacht Club together. There's all of these things that you can do because you own your own ape. Roadmap 2.0 right now is literally just a picture teasing out a lot of different things. And so the first thing that's coming out is called Ape Fest in New York, which I'll be attending, where we literally rented a yacht to go out on the Hudson River for a thousand of our friends to hang out. A lot of us have never met each other. We're also throwing a huge party in Brooklyn, and there's a bunch of other activities happening for this week. So that's kind of the first meetup in real life.And then there's teasing at things that people are guessing about or speculating. You can pull the picture up. One is a game, which a lot of people are talking about, like a game that group could play and things that we own, we have some sort of part in that as assets. The other that I'm most excited about is it looks like there could be an actual bar in Miami. The funny thing is this meme becoming a reality. We were joking about what would happen if this all took off. Imagine we had our own Yacht Club where we would just hang out at a bar together. And in fact, that might actually happen, and we're going to build one. And then the next one was DOW, which has really become, I think, going to be the big, next thing in crypto. It's been around for a while. But I think that it's gaining steam of, okay, if you bring all these people together, how do we think about governance? How do we think about what we do with the money?And so if you become a member of the Bored Ape Yacht Club, your voice, you can go into the discord. You can say, ""This is what I want to do."" People will work together to say, ""I want to do this on my own, or try to make recommendations of what actually the Yacht Club should do."" So, yes, I'm extremely excited about Roadmap 2.0. I never really thought there would be anything past Roadmap 1.0, to be honest. I thought we would do this. We would trade it. It would be this iconic thing you own that, when you looked back at time, you'd say, ""Okay, when NFTs became the mainstream onboarding to crypto,"" which I really believe NFTs will do, ""Bored Ape Yacht Club had a really strong place in how that all happened.But the brand and the strength has gotten so powerful, they've actually been able to generate something I think far beyond anyone's wildest streams, where now we're comparing it to Ferrari and Rolex and Supreme and saying like, ""This is going to be an international, global brand. And how do we handle this and what do we do with it?"" Far more than I think what we could have imagined at the onset. Patrick: Say a bit more about how that's all governed today. I'm sure it's less than 10,000 people since a lot of people own more than one, or maybe it's less than 30,000 since there's the Mutant off spin. But let's say it's 20,000 people that own one of these things are, quote unquote, members. Is it the original fore founders that are basically still the stewards of this brand? Decentralization is very nice sounding, but in the end, most things centralize. Power accrues to a small subset of a user base, et cetera, et cetera. How does that work today? Who carries the flame, so to speak, for this brand? Eric: Yeah. So according to OpenSea, there's 15,000 unique members across the 30,000. So on average, people have two. The fore founders, who are anonymous but have really fun names, they're in charge of steering the ship. What's interesting about how Web3 works is the consumer owns the asset. So have this unique alignment of incentives. If you think about a company that sold a thousand things and the price went from $200 to $150,000, any company today would say, ""We need to issue more supply."" We can sell a million of these things.But what's unique about how this worked is that there's this view of we as owners want the assets to appreciate, and we want there to be value. And the founders are getting a benefit when there is turnover or there's a trade in the membership as new people come in, or as someone sells something for $2.7 million, they benefit from the ongoing transactions of the actual underlying assets. What's interesting to me is the fore founders are completely in charge of where we're going, but the community has, I feel like an owner in it more than I feel like I just bought an asset and I own an avatar in a video game. I really feel like I'm part of something much bigger than myself. Patrick: If you think about some of the mechanics behind this, I think it's really important to dive into the details. The thing that really sparked my interest is this notion of IP ownership. So that leads me to believe that there are other profile picture projects or other NFT projects where that's not the case, where you don't own the IP. Just walk through that fork in the road. So what's an example of one where it's not owned by the owners? Seems contradictory. Talk me through the implications of one versus the other. Eric: So I've talked to a couple of legal friends about this, and right now I have three frameworks that we've learned about. The first was when Larva Labs, who's the creator of CryptoPunks, first launched them, I believe that they kept the copyright to themselves and they made some changes. But essentially it's something like Larva Labs holds the copyright to the project. I think there's pros and cons to all of these. What that means is Larva Labs can do a deal with a Hollywood agency and say, ""Use these."" But then they also licensed the CryptoPunks to the owners to use, and I think there's some fine trend of up to a hundred thousand dollars in value. And that was the original NFT connection between the creators and the owners. It was a copyright owned by the parent and then licensed to the owners. When Bored Apes came around, its first big addition to the NFT space was they just said, ""Let's give all the IP rights to the owners.""So you own your ape, and the Bored Ape Yacht Club what they retained was you can see we're on a podcast, but they own the logo of Bored Apes. They own the Bored Ape brand, the parent brand. So I can't go create a hoodie with this logo on it, but I can create as many hoodies as I want with my apes on them and sell them and do what I please. And so that was a third version and there's been a third version, I forget what they call it. But basically this one is just, the whole thing is just given to the community. Do whatever you want. There's no rules, there's no nothing. You want to create something, nobody owns anything, just full distribution. And so I think where we've discussed it, which has become interesting, is there's been people in traditional finance or other people on Twitter that have done this thing of copy and paste a picture to kind of say, ""This is all foolish.""And there's this view of, well, how does the property rights work? Do I have to go after every person that copies my ape? And the truth is, you do, but the community gets really upset when that happens and will actually go or Twitter and be like, ""They're impersonating me."" Whereas with CryptoPunks, there was a project that just took a punk and flipped it from right to left, from left to right. They just mirrored the image. As angry as it was and as silly as that sounds, Patrick, it got me into this fascinating thing of like, what is art and what is creation and what happens when people are inspired by other people? But in that case, CryptoPunks was able to represent their entire brand, go to OpenSea, and say, ""Take it down."" And so we're still in this experimentation play phase of how are property rights being transferred to the owners and what are they doing with them? And we have a couple of frameworks that I'm sure we'll see more as more projects come online.",2526
315,Eric Golden - Bored Ape Yacht Club,Mapping Old Models into this New World," Patrick: So one of the things that I'm always curious about in anything is, what is the fundamental behind the asset? And beautiful thing about Bitcoin or gold is there is none, it's a collective story or an agreement that grows or doesn't or whatever. And so price is kind of untethered beyond just the imaginations of donors. Whereas something like Ethereum that gets used a lot or Solana that gets used a lot or, in this case, Bored Apes, relative to, say, CryptoPunks that seem to have much less going on in their ecosystem. You can map their value onto some underlying thing that's not just price speculation and supply and demand.So how do you think about that as an owner? Do you care? These things are worth a lot of money today. It would be unsurprising if they were worth 5% of that amount in two months or something for some reason, because there's not a huge amount of underlying fundamentals. So as someone interested in NFTs, how do you think about that concept of earnings equivalent or cashflow equivalent or, I don't know what the unit of fundamental is, but how do you begin to map old models onto this new world? Eric: I think it's really hard and it's a question I ask myself every day looking at the prices. When CryptoPunks was released, it was released with no roadmap. That's been a big distinction of like, we're just putting these out to the world very much like Bitcoin. When Bored Apes showed up, they said, ""We're going to do something."" And there was a question of, what are you actually going to do? And so I think that, when I look at valuation, I would caution people that this is still wild speculation, people playing with what's possible. But Bored Apes is by far the group that has my attention of delivering and actually building a brand and has a lot more plans for the future. And where they've accumulated all this money, now it becomes an execution. So without any venture capital, they've generated over a hundred million dollars on their balance sheet to do a what they will.And you have a very passionate, loyal community. I think of Chris Dixon's 1,000 True Fans just hit me. I was like, ""Oh, I totally get it."" Where you've got 15,000 people of which there's definitely thousands of extremely loyal fans that want to see what's possible. And so I don't think people are doing discounted cashflow analysis on their ape. I think they're comparing them to other assets, if anything, and doing relative value. That's what I'm doing. And saying, ""When I first came into this space, I wanted a punk that's our gold or our treasury we're basing stuff off of."" And how much should a Bored Ape be in relation to a punk? How should a Bored Ape be in relation to a piece of art like Dmitri's Ringers? And so you're comparing it to other assets.The interesting thing is that they actually have, like with the airdrop mechanism, they actually did start to generate cash flow, but I'm not thinking that's going to be a professional thing. I think that's a one time thing, because then you get to how this suddenly does start to slip for people to feel like ponzis, where you're like, ""Oh, I've constantly got to issue a new thing, to issue a new thing."" And I can see why people are massively skeptical, which they should be. But I think that the brand is actually going to be able to build out IP that will be valuable. And I think that we're getting into a space that's fascinates me because at your conference where Mauboussin was talking about intangible value. And it's so hard for a good analyst to put that on a balance sheet. As a former portfolio manager, you're trying to value companies, and intangibles is where all of the value's going, but we have no good accounting metrics. And what I'm telling you is I'm buying intangible value.I don't know how to measure this yet. And I don't think we have the words or the measurement at mechanisms. We're just not at a place where you can say like, ""Oh, well that's what it does."" NFTs are starting to get into DeFi, which everything just feels like you're going towards this asset unlock using markets for price discovery. And you're starting to see NFTs just into the DeFi space. So with that, I think you might be able to do a little bit more of a traditional, but I don't think we've figured out yet what's the best approach to value these things. And so if anyone asks, I usually don't talk about this stuff, and here I am on your podcast because I don't want people to think you just buy it for $200, it goes to 150,000. Eric just DMed me the next project where that's going to happen. We could walk away. It's still a very speculative asset class. Patrick: What do you mean by NFTs are going into DeFi? What does that mean? Eric: So what that means is, what I'm interested is a new NFT project comes on. I'm very interested in what new aspect is it adding? We've seen the social status showing people, hey, I was earlier, I owned this really value asset. Clearly this is entertaining. The question is utility. What type of utility can these things bring? And so utility, to me, is innovation on the prior projects. There was a project, I don't know who the first one to do it was, but the one that's by far the most popular or the most successful is called CyberKongz.And what CyberKongz did was, when you bought one of their NFTs, you started earning tokens for every period of time you held it. So if you held it for a week, you got X amount of tokens. And then after you saved up enough tokens, you could then create the next tier of the membership. And so why that's really interesting is it's incentivizing people to hold for longer periods of time. And then you had this economic value. You knew that if I held it for X amount of weeks, I could collect enough tokens. With those tokens, I could create and NFT and sell it.And so then with tokens, now you can start to create liquidity pools, you can get into staking. You can do all of the things that people are doing in the DeFi space, but connected to an NFT instead of connected to a token. Now, I say that with all of the caveats I can, that what's been really interesting about this next step into DeFi is this question of, are these securities? Are you going to have regulation? What are you stumbling into from the silly art community, this is a fun project to, ""Oh wow. I have a cashflow producing asset. Was that supposed to be registered with the SEC?"" Patrick: Let's talk about fungible tokens in non fungible projects. If DeFi starts to become a part of or traditional fungible cryptocurrency start to be a part of these communities, how do you think that works in some detail? I think they actually even announced plans to do this a couple weeks ago within the Bored Ape Yacht Club. So let's say there's an Ape token. How do you think about that as a new element of this ecosystem that's being built? Eric: I'm really excited about it. When CyberKongz took off, then there were several other projects that all issue tokens, and all of the NFTs with tokens started to go stratosphere. Everyone started to rise. And so like everything in this type of space, a meme got created called when token, because everyone's like Bored Apes, what are you going to do? Everyone was waiting. And this is where I really respect the founders is they're not out there pumping their project. They're not telling you, ""Do this, do that."" They were really quiet. Every time they've been quiet, they've been heads down actually building. But the pressure I'd gotten pretty big of people asking, ""Are we going to get a token too?"" They announced they were working with two of the top law firms in the space to do this right. It basically assured everyone that, again, Bored Apes is a bit of a leader in this space of being like, ""If we're going to do something, we're going to do it.""Right. And so that put my fears to rest of like, ""Okay, these aren't just issuing a token and be like, oh, we'll figure out the regulation later."" They're actually being very thoughtful with every move they make. At first, I was like, ""Oh, all this ICOs from 2017, this seems bad."" It was giving me a bad feeling. But the more I dug in and talk to different people in the group, as well as outsiders of what it could actually be used for, I think it's possible you can imagine having a token that you could use in the real world as well as in the metaverse. I think that's extremely interesting. So if in fact we have a club and the club has a hotel room, imagine if the only way to stay there was to use currency purchased in this ecosystem.And so Patrick wants to go Miami and stay at the club, just like if you went to York and stayed at the Yale Club and you would need a reference from someone who's there, you could go to the Yacht Club, and the way you use membership was you had X of tokens to actually go and use it in the real world. I think you'll also see it in this idea of the metaverse, which is an overused term, but this notion of, if you want digital assets or you want to add to what's possible in the game or sandbox or these other places you could play around, that that currency could be used in a way that helps you interact with either your avatar or games or the places you're going to interact or walk around. Patrick: There's a quote from one of the anonymous founders whose pseudonymous name is Gargamel, and he said, ""Your Ape is your Amex black card,"" and that sounds like what you're getting at here, that the combination of your membership token, we'll call it, that's non-fungible, your unique ape, with some sort of fungible currency, would be the two assets that mattered in this ecosystem. And the utility becomes the things we talked about earlier. The club in Miami, the ability to do all this different stuff, perhaps partial ownership of a Supreme-like brand that the brand itself becomes valuable and you have participation in it. I like that phrase, your Ape is your Amex black card. Any other ways that we should think about that? Eric: I want to take a side story real quick because I love it. One of the Apes created an Amex black card with your Ape on it. So one of the members literally created, where I was a little bit nervous, I haven't done it, but I definitely want one. Because you're handing your credit card number over to a company, but they're making what it's like an Amex black card, but then instead of having the Spartan warrior in the middle, you have your own Ape laser etched on it, and it's an actual credit card. Patrick: It's an actual physical card. Eric: Physical card. After Gargamel said that, someone went out and built it. I don't know where I've ever existed with this type of innovation and energy to just do what you want to do and create these things. And it's such a positive group of people that were like, ""That's a really good idea. My Ape should be my black card."" And now, you can make your ape your black card. And so I just think it's a wonderful story about people actually just going out and doing the things that they want. And that wasn't sponsored by the group. It came from Gargamel's quote.",2666
316,Eric Golden - Bored Ape Yacht Club,Minting Mechanics," Patrick: I want to go back to a little bit of the mechanics of this world, and this will be a bit of abstracted away from just Bored Apes, but you've done a nice job in the past explaining to me what some of these terms mean and how, if there's going to be a lot more of these projects, there seems to be a lot more demand than supply right now so I'm sure we'll see more, how it actually works. So the first is this concept of minting. It makes sense to me to go on a website and send some cryptocurrency to pay for Bored Ape in a secondary market. That's like any other asset I would buy. But in terms of origination and how these things come into being, describe this to us. What are the different paths that project creators have pursued? What do you think are the pros and cons of those paths? Just walk us through this minting, origination concept for NFTs. Eric: I would say four different versions, big iterations. There's traditional minting, Dutch auction minting, mint passes, and whitelisting is the newest one. So the original minting, which is what Bored Apes did, is it's just called free and fair. And they posted on their website. Maybe they announce it. Maybe they don't. But back then, projects didn't sell it right away and they said, ""Okay. Hey, at this time on this day, you can come on. And if you pay us 0.08 Eth, you're going to mint and create an NFT in that moment."" And you go on and you would create one. Now, if we look at what ended up happening as projects got more popular, your passport Apes, when you would go on and you would pay your 0.08 Eth, you would find yourself in what's called a gas war. Because most of the NFTs right now, greater than probably 95% are on Ethereum.And there's other networks that do this, but most of it's on Ethereum. And so at that moment in time, oh, I'm like, ""I think this is a great project."" And Patrick is a great project, but there's only 10,000. And so what ends up happening is you'll say, ""I'll pay more gas in Ethereum to move up the line to make sure I get one of those 10,000 projects ."" What ended up happening was you had these evolutions of other projects where people like Meebits did a Dutch auction. And that was pretty popular in art blocks, where you'd start at a really high number, three Eth and say, ""If you want to pay up, go ahead. You'll guarantee it. But if you of weight, the number will slowly decrease and you can buy it for less."" Mint passes was a way of saying, ""Okay, I'm going to sell an NFT and try not to have a gas,"" even though they still caused them.And then at a later date, you could burn your mint pass for a new item. And whitelist is the newest one, which is my least favorite actually of all of them, where you get added to a list and those people have access to the mint, and there's a lot of question over who gets to decide who's on the list. But after you mint it, so let's just say you use a traditional method, you have a minting date, everyone goes in, there's a gas war. There's going to be 10,000 tokens distributed. There's a couple of paths that I can take. One is if it's generated on chain and one of it's if it's off chain.And so this is another issue that people were worried about at first, where when you do an off chain mint, there can be a period of time between minting and reveal. So there's a question over, is there any funny business? Did the data leak out? So you bought this NFT and at first, you see nothing. You see a general image. In the case of Bored Apes, I think it was a skull. And then you're wait for reveal day. And on reveal day, all the attributes suddenly appear and you can see what you own. So there's a lottery like game to it where people love minting. Because if you went in on the Bored Ape mint, you paid 0.08 and you got a gold fur Ape.Even on day one, that was going to be worth multiples more than a floor Ape. So back to our rarity, there's a fun part about minting that's a bit more of the speculation lottery of, ""Oh, I really hope I get one."" And so what ends up happening is after mint, the price usually goes up for an exciting project because there's a positive EV associated with, what are the odds of actually getting one of those rarer ones? And then right after reveal, the price plummets. And for new people, this is not an exciting experience, because you're like, ""Oh, it's doing great. I don't even know what it is,"" and then it crashes. And that first crash is the EV being taken out, the expected value, that, ""Oh, I didn't get the rare one. So what's the floor worth?"" I just sell at the floor and then a floor gets established and then you start to figure out how much the rarities actually cost. Patrick: Talk a little bit more, even in greater detail, about minting, literally what is happening. So you're sending 0.08 Eth. Where is that going? How is that being sourced? Where does the picture itself live? Some live on chain, some live off chain. Literally what is happening from a flow of bits standpoint when something is minted? Eric: So you are connecting your wallet typically via a website, like you mentioned, and that website is then... When you log on, you're signing a contract. And that contract is saying, ""I'm allowing my wallet to interact with this contract."" And by sending 0.08 Eth to that contract, the contract's saying, ""In exchange, if you're one of the 10,000 people, we'll deliver you a token and that token will be a unique identifier."" So if you own token 3,204, that's your token. The next question is, what is token 3,204 actually equal? When you have stuff that was generated on chain, which means that the actual contract, the actual token has some, if not all, of the descriptive data or the actual image, that's considered the most secure because it's all on chain. The problem with it, as people have learned with studying different blockchains, is that takes up a lot of space.And so if we put all of the art on chain, every time we move it around, it's really expensive and cost prohibitive. And so people came up with the pointing to a decentralized server, in this case, IPFS, where you're actually linking to another server. And that server holds the image. Now, this has gotten people worried in the past. You'd go through, for anyone who's not crypto, but is, we call it FUD, which is fear, uncertainty, and doubt. And everyone freaks you out and says, ""Oh my God, you bought a website link. That's really silly."" And you're constantly told, ""This is the dumbest thing you've ever done,"" which is a self selecting process of, how far in the frontier do you want to go?I personally love it. So IPFS is a decentralized server where you can store the image. There's another service called Airweave, where people have started to download and protect their assets, because they're afraid, what happens if the link gets changed? What happens if the service goes down? I don't actually own it. And so that cause, for some buyers, they'll only buy on chain art, independent of what it looks or what it does, but you lose a lot of the flexibility if we're going to stay on Ethereum. With what you can actually build, unless you do something like I described, that Bored Apes did. Patrick: And the other example you gave earlier of you as a Bored Ape owner got serum, and the mixing of serum in your Bored Ape created one of these mutant apes. Again, is that just all mediated the same way? There's some smart contract That's just like, if you press a button on a website or something, the thing happens and then your wallet is filled this new token? Eric: That was super cool, and that was an innovation that they had been working on from the beginning. The Bored Ape dogs that were gifted really just were shocked that this is going so well. How do we repay the community? That wasn't on the roadmap. Then mutants, they were working on since the beginning and that was super cool. And so what happened was, if you were an ape holder, you got one of three serums, M1, M2, or Mega.So there was going to be 20,000 total mutants created. 10,000 were going to be part of a public sale. 10,000 were going to be distributed to the existing 10,000 holders. And so if you got M1, there was going to be 7,500 M1s, 2,500 M2s, and eight Megas. And everyone was excited that technically, you could take any ape and the ape could mutate three times. So if you had a gold ape, you could make your original gold ape. Then you could make the M1 gold ape, the M2 gold ape, and possibly the Mega.When the serum came out, it was really saying just to play with the assets where you could keep the serum and keep your ape un-mutated. So people were saying, ""Oh, I wonder if my un-mutated ape will be more valuable if everyone mutates and mines a virgin."" And then people are like, ""No, I want to collect the whole set. I want to have my original, my M1 and my M2. And I want to put them all together and keep them as a bundle."" And so people were playing with it differently.But what the mechanics were, as on the website, when you went on there, you connected your wallet, you said, ""This is the ape I want to mutate."" You connected it with another NFT. And then combination of those NFTs created a third NFT. So it was a new mechanism that allowed you to actually mint the third one, but there was no gas war. There was no trouble with it because we had been air dropped the serum. So the beauty is if people look back at their original owners and say, ""Okay, the owners are going to get first crack,"" that might not be the best way to open it up to people. So there was the public sale. But using the serum through an air drop allowed everyone to get this. And then today you can go by serum if you want and mutate your Ape, but it hasn't all been done yet. Some people are still sitting on their serum and waiting to either sell it or use it in the future. Patrick: One of the things that's so interesting about this story is the inversion of, usually in the world of business first comes product, then comes distribution, then comes success. Sometimes businesses have started with distribution, build new products and had success that way. This seems to be the first example of, I like the term bottom-up brand. That first comes community that's boot strapped into existence. The community then starts doing stuff, it's sort of headless. There's the four guys, of course, who I think are stewards. But the black card example is a great one. What other examples of this bottom-up brand concept are the most interesting to you in terms of what you've seen in the Bored Ape Yacht Club so far? And any thoughts on just that as a big trend? Eric: Yeah, I think that there's definitely been lots of people testing and being entrepreneurial with their Apes and trying to make things happen. I think one of the things that caught me off guard was the celebrity status. In two ways. The first is celebrities joining the club and being able to talk to them like normal people. That was a big shock to me. I had made a post about how I'm a huge fan of Derrel Maury. And I knew he was collecting on NFTs. And so Cuban was joking about something. And I said I made a bet that Derrel is smarter than Cuban, and I'll go buy a Bored Ape before Mark Cuban did. And sure enough then Darrel retweeted at my silly anonymous account, ""I already own one."" And then Cuban quickly followed on. It's like, when are you going to be able to talk to people like that?Steph Curry joined. Dez Bryant, Shaquille O'Neal. And they came into the discord like normal people. It wasn't their handlers saying, ""How do we get access to it?"" It was just a person joining a club, and everyone went crazy. Because you were interacting with some people's greatest heroes and these celebrities coming in. The other side of that coin, which has happened, which again is surprising. But again, it's similar to that black card status. Is if you're a black card holder, other vendors want access to who the black cardholders are. You want to show them, hey, these people have assets are willing to take risks.What's interesting in the NFT space is with your Ape, we've gotten free drops from other creators just to get the stamp of approval that if the Bored Apes like it, maybe this project has legs. So it's served in a way that I never anticipated of every day someone says, ""Oh, it's scary because it is all decentralized."" And people are like, ""Check your wallet, you get this free token."" And you're like, ""Maybe I do."" But someone did, and I get nervous about that a little bit, of a great way to scam people because these things are very expensive. But you do get access to a lot of different things.",3098
317,Eric Golden - Bored Ape Yacht Club,Investing Lens," Patrick: We've talked mostly about the neat aspects of all this, and much less about the investing side, the potential for earning, let's say a cold rational return. And not caring at all whether you hold onto an Ape for a day or a year. To view them as trading vehicles, let's say. Which, people love to gamble, people love to trade. Do you think that there's room for an NFT investment story? That sounds like there really aren't those today, there's crypto investment firms. I'm not aware of any major firm where it's a fund and it's just buying and selling NFTs. Is that just gambling to you? And if not, how do you think this evolves as these things becoming investments? Just like you might describe art as an investment or some other collectible as an investment, or some other utility security as an investment. I'm just curious, since you come from the investing world, how you view this through that lens versus this great community lens that we've spent most of the conversation on. Eric: I believe that there's one major issue. But before I get to the issue, I'll split up into three categories. I believe you could create an NFT fund and do a buy and hold on really what are considered the blue chip or historically significant pieces of work in this space. And if you're betting on Web 3, being a big deal, and you also believe that NFTs will be the big onboarding to mainstream into this world, that you could build a portfolio and lock it up, and wake up in 10 to 20 years and it could have significant value if you're right about that. I believe there's an ability to trade the assets coming from the fixed income markets. It's an over the counter market. And this is much similar. The bid ask spread right now on Bored Ape is probably 35 Eth someone will sell it, and someone will buy it for probably 30, maybe 20.80. So the bid ask spread is five to seven Eth, which in today's dollars is 20 to $30,000.Now this is not the most liquid, but when you're used bid ask spreads and ticks, you can drive a truck through this. So clearly you have, in a liquid small market, and there's opportunities to trade assets. But by and large, it is speculative. And a lot of people are betting on the next project or the next thing to go up. And people are playing it like a lottery, and there's a lot of gambling. And so it definitely has those properties. And I think the risk is that we talk about it, about going down the rabbit hole. If I was sitting in my old seat with my full-time job looking at this, I would say, this is crazy. All gambling, and it's insane."" And while that's a lot of it, I think that the gamblers are the ones that are willing to try if they see that there's an edge.People can have careers in daily fantasy sports. When we were going to high school, I never thought that would be a real thing. And so you definitely can speculate in the space, and a lot of it is gambling. But I believe we're seeing the formation of a new asset class. And so I believe that the experimentation is going to lead to more utility in the form of, I think gaming is the big one that's coming. It's already here. Axie, and Zed. But I think we're going to see more and more introductions of play to earn gaming, which is going to onboard a lot of folks. And then I think the next level is seeing in real life utility of what you can actually use these things for. It's going to become more ubiquitous, where people going to be like, ""We used to buy tickets to a sporting event, and then we had to print out PDFs, and then we had QR codes. But why am I not just getting my tickets in NFT form going to the game?""And when I'm there and Mark Cuban knows I'm there, they can airdrop me a pass for me and my kids to be like, oh, you were at this game. And if you collect 10 of these, then you're going to be in the super fan club and be entered into a raffle to win the playoff tickets. And so I think NFTs will become far more ubiquitous as it becomes in real life. And so from an investing standpoint, I'm interested in all three of those areas. I'm interested in the long-term buy and hold assets that if you ever get your hands on you want to put away. And say, this is my Mona Lisa or my prized possession. I'm interested in the ability to trade and move around the markets where you can make money. And if I'm bullish on Eth, which I am. And this is a good way to get more Eth, then I would do it. I think you can speculate. And that's okay, as long as you do it with money you're willing to lose. And you're not tying up funds that you're saying, ""I need these."" I think that's okay. And by doing those three things, I think your best position to see what's coming and know who actually is going to unlock a lot of this value and create the things that are going to make NFTs so ubiquitous in our future. Patrick: Given how much time you've spent on this, and your comment earlier that 95 or something like that percent of these projects are on Ethereum. How do you think about the infrastructure in this space? Solana is the obvious one that people tend to ask about. Ethereum has its benefits, it also has its drawbacks. Do you think that most of this activity, this NFT asset class that's emerging, or whatever you want to call it, will be primarily on Ethereum? Yes, no? If not, why not? Eric: I mean, I'm grateful for how much you've taught me about Solana, and I'm not a Maxy by any means. Of all of the blue chip long-term assets that I would hold and put away for 10 to 20 years, they're all in Ethereum. End of sentence. Period. Glyphs, Punks, Ringers, XCOPY. These aren't on Solana, they're on one chain and they matter a lot. That's not going to change. I have begun to play with Solana NFTs. The idea of it is that they're lower cost, so you can do lower cost projects. And I think that's really interesting. Where my first experience with that was on Matic Polygon with Zed Run, and that needed to be. 38,000 horses, the horses are running 10 to 20 races per day, or whatever we're at now with fatigue. So you a lot of transactions. And if you did that on Ethereum, Zed could never run.And so they're using an L2 chain for that, and that's working decently well. Anyone who's been in crypto and has ever used a bridge to cross trains knows how heart palpitating that moment is of, where did my money just go? I think we will see NFTs on other chains. I think that for utility and access and things we want to move around quickly that are lower cost, there's definitely a place for other chains to use NFTs. If you look at NBA Top Shot and what Rohan has built, Flow is a private blockchain. And what that allows is to do some really cool things that there is no transaction costs. You can use credit cards, you can go back to uses your dapper balance. But you're in currently a closed wall environment, which I believe will be opened up over time. So I totally see another place for other blockchains and the adoption of NFTs.I think it matters... If I was working with a content creator like you. And you were saying, ""Okay, where should we place our NFTs?"" The question would be, well, what are you creating? Are you creating the once in a lifetime full Patrick experience and it's going to go for six to seven figures? Then we're going to want to go to Ethereum for that. If we're doing a conference token that we're going to use once, and it's going to go away, I'm much less inclined to use that Ethereum. Because I don't want the guests to show up, and when they show up we're having a gas surge because there's some trading going on and they can't get into the show. So we would want to use Solana or Matic for speed. I think it depends on what NFT you're creating and what your use cases are. Patrick: Is there anything about the Bored Ape Yacht Club specifically that you think is most innovative or exciting as a project that we haven't covered? Eric: I would just say that the fact that it was pushed by the community so hard. It was my first experience of actually feeling the consumers feeling like owners. I don't know if that's really sunk into people of the bypassing of the venture capital folks to fund ideas, and this connection of creator with owner. And so I think that what Bored Apes showed me, but really expands my view of the whole universe, is that the ability for content creators or businesses to connect directly with their end consumer and remove a lot of middle men is just mind blowing when you think about the possibilities.The idea that Taylor swift could connect with her fans without Ticketmaster, Live Nation, StubHub, Google search, all of the things in the middle that are taking money away from Taylor and out of her consumer's pockets. And they're not going to go away forever. But the fact that we could make connection a lot closer is wild to me. And then the second thing I learned from Bored Apes is that it really starts to make you think about, what are all the assets? We love markets, we love price discovery as finance people. What are all of the markets that currently don't trade? Not because they shouldn't, but just because they're too small or they haven't been unlocked yet. And the fact that we actually could create new assets and have all of these new markets is just the most exciting thing I've ever seen. Patrick: Well, I think that's a great place to end it. I think the possibility remains much larger than the present reality. Is the nice way of saying it, I think. And maybe the healthy, skeptical way of viewing this ecosystem as burgeoning possibility. And certainly for me, I try not to have opinions too much on anything I do publicly, just because it's much more fun to listen to other people's views. But I do think that is the most interesting thing here, what you closed with. Which is the possibilities for community and interaction, and new business models that get unlocked by this technology. And I can't wait to watch it with you as a friend, and continue to learn from projects like Bored Ape. I think many people will be a part of creating one of these things in the future. And so it's a great introductory lesson to, I think, probably the most interesting of these projects today.

318,Will Marshall - Indexing the Earth,Introduction," Patrick: My guest today is Will Marshall, the co-founder and CEO of Planet. Will founded Planet in 2010 with a small team of NASA scientists to build a constellation of satellites that would image the entire earth every day. Since then, Planet has successfully built and deployed 450 satellites into space, which the company is using to create a time series of images for every place on earth. Our conversation covers the untold space story. How space is going through an internet moment where cost reductions and performance enhancements have led to a seismic shift in what's possible above our atmosphere and how that can drastically improve life on earth through unique data sets like the one Planet's piecing together. Once you listen to Will speak about Planet's progress and mission, it's hard to think of a more underappreciated company in business today.

319,Will Marshall - Indexing the Earth,Space Renaissance," Patrick: So Will, I think the place to begin since this is such a cool, exciting area space, the space renaissance that we're going to be talking about today in your company, Planet Labs. Maybe you could just give us your impression of what's happening in space. And I think it's going to draw a nice contrast to the very obvious rocket focused, billionaire focused thing that ever... Going to Mars, going to the moon, I think you're seeing a very different side of space and are a part of building that new industry and that new world. Just give us your overview, how you interpret what's happening in this ",138
320,Will Marshall - Indexing the Earth,Planet's Customer Use Cases," Patrick: Let's talk now about how customers interface with you. I love the story of starting in the garage, building a very low-cost satellite, the Dove satellites, getting the constellation up there, mission accomplished. It's going to keep compounding and getting higher and higher resolution. What was the first commercial interaction that you had? Did you plan to cater to the agriculture industry to start or did that emerge as sort of like an unpredicted or unpredictable use case? Will: We had thought about that use case as a very early one. One way to think about it is look at the areas of the earth and how are they used. About a quarter of the land mass of the earth, 25%, is agricultural land, so we went into that. A quarter of the land mass of the earth is forestry, so we went into that. About 10% is urban development, the suburb and/or urban, then there's of course large areas of marine. Anyway, but agriculture was an obvious one just from a sheer area. We knew that we could do something useful in agriculture within the infrared band. That's a known thing from land establishment been doing this for 40 years, except it's just doing it in a slower cadence, which makes it less useful growing the crops and helping the crop development. It's more for the annual survey of, ""How did we do?"" Which is useful at the end of the year, but it's not helpful for the grower in the crop growing season.Because what the farmer wants is intelligence about their field a few times a week during the crop growing season. And so by having daily information at that three-by-three meter area of every field of that farm, every one of their fields, we can help them do what's called precision agriculture. That can improve their crop yield by 20 to 40%, at the same time decrease their use of things like fertilizer and other resources by similar amounts. That's a big deal if you think of that. We can do that. Of course, a trillion dollar industry. This is, as I said, the general notion of big data and AI enabling the digital transformation of industries. Ag is a canonical example. We do that, for example, with Corteva. They use this to image about a million farmers' fields every day. This is not a minor operation and the lot of those kind of companies that can use our data to help with precision ag.The other areas, we help civil governments, normally things like disaster response. It's also science. So we work with NASA on a lot of science, like climate science, but we also work with state and local governments and federal governments on things like floods and fires. We have been helping recently with the floods in Germany, where they had a lot of big floods, the biggest floods there for 60 years, with the fires here in California, helping the world wildfires. We can both detect where the fires are to help the firefighters, like where's the wind blowing, where's the edge of the fire, where is it compared with whatever hill? So we can help with it real time and we can help with preventative work. So we can actually, and we have, map every tree in California and where's the fodder for growth for future mega fires? That can help them to then make clearing or do a fire lane in the future to stop future mega fires. So it's preventative work.Same with flooding, we can see the flood the day before, the day after the flood, and see which bridge is down to help the relief effort. But we can also then model where's the floodplain going to be, which buildings are in the wrong place, where should they build and not build. Especially in developing countries, are often build in the wrong place, so we have a big project with Google where we're doing this in Bangladesh and India. It's because the floodplains change, they can then advise governments, ""Don't build here, do build here."" That's important for getting assets out of the way of the flood. It's also important for finance, by the way, because they also want to understand which assets are at risk from these various disasters or potential disasters. So civil government's another area.We also work with mapping. There's a fascinating use case, and this is where it gets into what consumers might actually see, because we're not actually selling the imagery to consumers, we're selling to big businesses, but it does affect day to day people because the maps that you have online are kept up-to-date with our data. The news you see about world events, we're sort of shedding light about everything going on on the planet. Pulitzer prize this year was won by some journalist who used our data to discover about 200 potential Uyghur, that's Muslim detention camps in Western China that had previously not been known. And that sort of is really important for journalism. That happens using our data to uncover what's going on around the world.And also if you grew up in a disaster, our data might be helping the disaster responders to help you. So it actually affects people day to day. But with mapping that one case, we work with Google, for example, on updating the maps that you see online all the time, whenever they find any indication that map is going out date, they automatically task our stuff, it takes a picture of that location, extracts out that new road, that new train station, that new building, whatever it is, and then it updates the map you see online so that your directions and everything stay up to date. So there's a lot of different applications. I'm just giving you a sample. Patrick: The story that's emerging is this incredible thing where so much of the world is dictated by legibility around data that we've surfaced. And this is like, what's more important than the place where we live? It makes me start to wonder about big questions like defense or national sovereignty, the famous spy planes from the Cold War or something. This is that every day of the entire earth. So how do you think of about certain nations not wanting you to see certain things? What is sovereignty in space? How will the rule of law and nations interact in this new frontier? Will: Good question. Firstly, it's interesting the US and Russia established early on in the space age that they would not be able to fly planes over each other's territory. Famously, the Russians shot down the U-2 spy plane with Gary Powers and kept him captive, but they would allow satellites to flow over each other's territory and partially that's because satellites can't just maneuver around countries. If you're coming up- Patrick: Right. Will: ... come up to Russia and turn left, you're in the, you're going to go over Russia, right? Patrick: Right. Will: Unlike a plane you can turn around. So you're going to go over Russia. And then the only question is, are you going to allow them to take a picture or not? Well, how are you going to stop them taking a picture? Then they were like, this doesn't work. Are we going to allow satellites to fly over each other's territory without permission? In fact, they felt that this is a good thing, then they cemented it and it became international law, that up to 100 kilometers altitude, it's your territory, and beyond that it's space. Once you're in space, you are not in anyone's sovereign territory and you are allowed to take pictures from there of any territory without their permission. So we can take pictures inside North Korea. The North Korean government may not like that, but they have no choice.But vice versa, in principle the North Koreans can put up satellites and take pictures of America and they, in principle, can do that. They don't have that, but they could. It's a bit of a thing that they decided early on in the space age was going to be something that everyone could do and that transparency was better. And in fact, it reduced tensions in the Cold War. We're actually doing a whole bunch of work with governments, intelligence agencies that do use our data and you think, ""Oh, well they already have satellites."" Well, they do, yes, but they don't have nearly as many as we do. Patrick: Yeah. Will: I mean, we have the most by far. So we see a lot of stuff that they don't, yet. We do the scan and they only task it at the locations they already know to look, which very interesting to them. We find new things that they didn't know to look for, a new missile base in Eastern Iran we just recently found for example, and that's kind of interesting to a lot of people. I think this is a generally a good thing. We're not, by the way, ever exclusively giving that to one government or another. The more that we give that to lots of governments, the better it is for peace and security, just like it was during the Cold War, the Russians and the American knew about each other. But it's also a significant business opportunity for us because that data is relevant to a lot of countries and they all want to know.",2015
321,Will Marshall - Indexing the Earth,Mapping Out a Business Model," Patrick: Talk me through a little bit the way you figured your way through a business model, because most businesses you can think about like cost based pricing or value based pricing, just to really oversimplify it. Using the crop example, you're making 20-something percent improvement in a trillion dollar industry. Well, that sounds like a lot of pricing power. Right? How do you think about pricing your various products and services? It seems like a real challenge, that there's enormous investment to get this ongoing thing into space and happening, which took six years, you said. Now you've got to figure out how to charge for these things. It's not like someone can spin up a competitor easily. So, how do you think through those dynamics of the business model itself and things like pricing? Will: Yes. We basically sell imagery on a per-unit area basis: kilometers, hectares, mainly just area. The more area you get, there is a volumetric discount, but obviously pay more. We do have a lot of pricing power, I agree. Right now there's no one else that does this. To your point, it's very hard to get this data set. You have to erect a huge satellite fleet and ground stations, mission control systems, data processing and all the rest. So it's certainly not for the faint of heart, so it would take many years for somebody to build such a system. And of course, we're not going to sit on our hands, we're going to constantly improve it. That data archive, it's impossible to go back and get. It's actually, there's some really important moats around what we've built, but yes, we do have a fair bit of pricing power, some level it's value based pricing.But I do think that what's most important for us is where we going next is not just the imagery and selling the imagery, but selling information products derived from that imagery, what we call ""going up the stack."" The main thing we are doing today and the reason we're going public, one of them is, of course, we have capital to then deploy. The main areas we're deploying in, one is the sales and marketing to go off the vertical market we already know work like agriculture, civil government and the ones I was describing. The second thing is that there's loads of potential to other markets, but they need more than images. Hedge funds could get huge value out of our data. I mean, we know how well crops are doing before anyone else, the whole world saw your yield. We know the output from all the world's copper mines before anyone else.So presumably, those things are really valuable to those commodity prices. However, they do not want those pictures. They want a time-series-calibrated date. We have the data to underpin that, but we haven't built the analytics that enable us that yet. So the other side of what we are doing is investing in what we call going up the stack, and then we'll be charging more and more for just information products derived from the data. Anyway, a little bit of a long-winded answer to your question, but mainly it's volumetric based on the amount of data, but also as we go up, the value stack will be charging more for those, if you like, smaller bits of data that we can drive from the imaging. Patrick: And how much of that is push versus pull in terms of deciding where to go with that movement up the stack? Are you basically letting people tell you what they want, or are you anticipating what they might want and then trying to sell it to them, or some combination of the two? Will: I think it's a healthy combination of the two. We pride ourselves on thinking more than just what the customer's immediately asking for, because often the biggest opportunities from a business perspective are doing things that people don't know they want yet. No one asked for an iPad or an iPhone. When they got it, they were pretty excited. So they were thinking ahead. No one asked for a daily image of the whole earth. Thinking ahead.The same with analytics, but we also listen to our customers. So for example, a lot of our ag customers are saying, ""Can you just fuse this data with this data, and then it would be more valuable?"" We are doing that ourselves right now, but we don't really want to. We want to focus on the farming. Great, sure. We'll do that, and will follow their lead and add that stuff so that it takes that off their plate and adds value to us, and it helps the customer, eases their use and helps them to focus where they want to focus. Patrick: What does tension feel like in this business? When you're stressed out, what are typically the reasons? It seems like the problems that you encounter are just of a completely different type than a typical business would, given the unique nature of what you've built. What is crisis, stress, tension? What does that feel like for Planet? Will: I would say we're a company like any other. There's growing pains where you have to shift different stages of company where not everyone knows each other any more, and then this happens or you need this sort of leadership and not that kind of leadership, and this... There's so many growing pains as we go. I think we've done fairly well, but we are not immune to those things, just like any other companies. I would say it's the nuts and bolts. There are some things that come up when certain actors ask us for data and we're like, ""Should we give this to them?"" And so we have an ethics committee. We firstly review against the embargoed list. We can't sell to North Korea; we can't sell to Taliban or something, but also, we have an ethics committee that even after that, goes, ""Okay, we're allowed to sell to these guys, but should we?"" Our data's not generally relevant to militaries targeting or anything like personal privacy, because we can't identify a person, but there are some cases where we worry and avoid those use cases.In general, our data really helps this wide-scale transparency, and helping companies and countries understand resource movements. That's really very positive and we wouldn't be doing this if we didn't think the net was massively in that direction, but we are trying to... Occasionally a stressful moment is probably if someone asked for it that we are like, ""Ah, I'm not sure if we should give it to these people,"" and we have often refused in those cases. Patrick: Data privacy has become a really interesting big issue in a world that's proliferative in data, and so many companies that know so much about us. What do you think will happen in privacy over the next couple of decades when it comes to your business? Or just the idea that assuming all these resolution curves keep going on the same direction, presumably you're going to be able to see into my house on a second-by-second basis, potentially? How do you think about the future of privacy and concerns that we should have there collectively? Will: Firstly, right now, we really can't see or identify a person from space, and I don't think anyone can, even with the huge satellites, and the reason is that you're just so far away. You're 400 kilometers away. So yes, we can see your house, but firstly, it's impossible with current technology to see through it, and I don't know how we would do that, and secondly, the pixel size is really large . Even, as I said, the biggest spying satellites in the biggest countries cannot identify a person from space. Their resolution is just not sufficient. And so it's really a matter of distance.So if you want to get into personal privacy, really, drones might get into that, but satellites... And it's a long way off. I can't even imagine that. It's just because you can't fly reasonably in a satellite lower than about 300 kilometers altitude, otherwise you're just starting to burn up in the atmosphere. To go below that, you really need a plane or a drone. And so I think space, for a long period, isn't going to get really into the thick of privacy. Patrick: Maybe you're going to do it all, but I'm curious just to talk, then, a little bit more about the technology of satellites themselves. If you had to group satellites in some sort of taxonomy into different categories, how would you do that today? So there's imaging satellites. You mentioned communication satellites. Will: There's roughly five types today. There's imaging satellites. There's communication satellites. Those are the main ones where there's a commercial sector, although both of them have military versions of those things. The other three are navigation, which is pretty much only governments at the present time: Galileo in the EU, GPS here; early warning, which is countries scan for anyone's missile launches; and then there's what they call signals intelligence, which is listening into people's communications, so listening to your cell phone or listening in, and again, this is CIA stuff. So those are the main five types of satellites that exist today, but the commercial ones are really just communications, and now SpaceX with the Starlink system is putting up a big communication fleet, and earth observation, which Planet has put up a big fleet now. Patrick: If you stick in the earth-observation planet category, what do you think are the most far-fetched sci-fi potential futures for what the technology might enable, say, the rest of your career or something like that? On some timeline that's long but reasonable. Will: Well, I do think that it's possible in the long term that we would more or less be able to have a live image of the earth. I think that that's possible. It's not where we are now, and it won't be for a long time, but it's possible. And then the second thing is I imagine that you should be able to just query that. You should just be able to write... Just imagine a search query box on it and you can just say, ""Hey, how many houses are there in Pakistan? Give me a plot of that versus time. Tell me where the trees were deforested, the latitude and longitudes of the trees that deforested in the Amazon in the last three weeks.""It should be able to just tell you the answer to those questions without ever you looking at the images, or it may highlight that in the background or something, but you should be able to get answers, just like you can from Google. So I think a lot of what Planet's doing in the long arm is a little bit similar to Google. Google figured out how to index the internet and make it searchable, and we are figuring out how to index the earth and making it searchable with the combination of the data and machine learning that sits on top. Patrick: Can you say a little bit more about that machine learning and that actual exercise? That just seems like a Herculean task to go index the earth. Pretty cool idea, but sounds pretty hard as well. Will: Well, it was a hard task to index the internet, but they managed to do it. Well, just imagine a picture of the earth and machine learning and especially computer vision that's been developed, especially, by companies like Google and Academia and others, has been particularly strong in computer vision where it does things like extract out cats and dogs from pictures that you put online. The same technology could be used in our image to extract out a road or a building or a ship or a plane or a train or a tree.So we just have to do that for every image that comes down. As I said, we have about three million images every day. So you have to do that for every image and identify all the different objects, and then you have basically a database of every object on the planet over time, and then you should be able to exactly do that query on top of it. I actually think it's intellectually relatively straightforward. Of course, there's such a huge amount of work behind that.",2683
322,Will Marshall - Indexing the Earth,Saving The Planet," Patrick: With this unique data set moving up the stack that you've done, what knowledge about the Earth has most surprised you that's resulted from this data set so far? Will: Well, the degree of calamity of the destruction of ecosystems is just staggering. So we are wiping out forests, mainly to put cows on them so we can eat beef-burgers. We are destroying the fisheries with ocean trawling. We are seeing huge transitions. Because it's not actually climate change. It's mainly these things like deforestation and illegal fishing. So it's been driven by humans deciding to change the use of those territories, and that is just really obvious and sad, but hopefully, our data can help companies and countries and individuals better manage the planet. We've, what, lost 70% of life on the planet in the last 40 years? It's gobsmacking to think about. We are just whittling it away still. Our raison d'être, in many ways, is to help stop that, is to help the governments to see the deforestation. So we have a project to map all... Which we do. All the deforestation in the 64 tropical countries, with the Government of Norway paying for the data, helping that data be available to those forestry ministries to stop deforestation. It's a huge project.We have another one to map all the world's coral reefs, and we just released that a few weeks ago, which is the first map of all the world's corals, classification of different types, and showing early signs of bleaching. Or if there's any illegal fishing going on, we can alert governments. In fact, there are already six countries have established marine-protected areas around coral reefs that we mapped for them. So those are the kind of things that can really help us protect and stop the eco side that's happening on the planet. And so that is both a thing that's super important for the planet, and it's a massive business opportunity, because what is really happening is that global economy is going, ""Ah, we cannot any longer presume that natural capital is free."" That the trees you cut down, and it's free for the landowner; they can just cut down that tree and it's cost nothing. Or you can just put gases into the atmosphere and it doesn't matter, or pollutants into the rivers and it doesn't matter.There's an externality of that cost. We've got to integrate the externality into our economic system. And that is the countries saying, ""We're going to measure these emission targets and set these limits,"" and it's companies doing their ESG targets and saying, ""Hey, the environment piece I'm going to measure and make sure that my resources came from a sustainable source, or make sure I don't build those assets in a flood-risk zone,"" or these sort of things. And what does that mean? All of that means those countries and the companies have to measure all that stuff. So this is a massive business opportunity, because we have the data set that's pretty foundational to the measurement of all that natural capital. It's measuring all those things. It's not just that we can see every tree and stop deforestation. We can count the carbon stock in all those trees. Our data is foundational to underpinning the transition to a sustainable economy, which is a multi-trillion dollar transition as well. Patrick: The 70% number that you quoted over the last 40 years, which is a staggering, horribly depressing number, what's the attribute of that 70%? What specifically has been wiped out that makes up most of that decline? Will: Well, it's pretty much everything. 82% of wild mammals have gone, 75% of insects, 70% of the fish in freshwater rivers and lakes, over half the coral systems; these are all the things that have gone already. We've wiped up more than half of the forests. There was roughly double as much forested land of the Earth 40 years ago. Oh, it's just staggering. Patrick: So we're basically an invasive species, is one way to think about it? Will: Yeah. Patrick: This data set is step one in any change, which is awareness, I think. Will: More than just awareness. I feel like satellites have already been bringing awareness about this problem for about 50 years. That's why the climate scientists have been yelling from the top of the mountain-tops as best they can, and telling us, ""This is what's going to happen,"" and no one's been listening. This is the data set that enables us to take action. You see, the difference between what had been happening before with satellites was every few months or every year, we would take a measurement and go, ""This is what's going on, guys."" Now, it's, ""There is deforestation happening there. Stop it. There is illegal fishing there. Stop it."" It's the real-time action and the real-time measurement and the real-time enforcement that is actually going to enable us to, I hope, turn the page tackling this massive challenge.",1135
323,Will Marshall - Indexing the Earth,"Going Public, Building Hardware, and the Future"," Patrick: One interesting thing just where the rubber meets the road: you already mentioned the company's going public. How do you think about that transition as it relates to this big mission? I mean, if everything we've talked about holds true, this sounds like it could be, both in business terms and in terms of impact terms, one of the most important companies on the planet, or off the planet, I guess. How do you think about the relationship that you build with the business and investing community to make sure that you maximize the odds that that's true? Will: Well, look, I'm really excited about going public. I think it's the right step for planet. Planet is ready to be a public company. We've launched and operated satellite fleet is ready. That technology to risk is retire. We've got a mature business with over a hundred million in revenue last year. We're ready. And what we are feeling is the pull, we're feeling everyone needing our data now. Well, then we need to scale up to do that, to address all of that market opportunity. And I think from what I've seen, investors really like it for a number of reasons. One is that our data is completely unique. No one else can get it. It powers a lot of vertical markets. It's not just relevant to agriculture. It's relevant for energy insurance, finance, da, da, da, da, da. They love the fact that it's a data business.We've got this hard moat to crack in terms of the hardware that enables this, but the data business, we're selling data, and we can sell each image multiple times. So the profit margins are really large. The incremental cost of us selling an image to a second customer's very, very low. So the direct margins are just huge. And then everyone recognizes how important the transition to a sustainable economy is. And so it's space. It's sustainability. It's a data company. It's exactly what the market wants at this time. I'm confident this is the right move for Planet this time. Patrick: I'd love to learn a little bit more about the hardware. You said that great quote at the beginning that the best software companies also build hardware because it enables like a very specific one-to-one relationship between the two. Tell me what's evolved since that first satellite you built by hand in the garage. What were the components like then and what has happened? Like give me a sense of what it cost to make one of these things, what's going into it, what is the hardware story here that's most interesting? Will: Yeah, since that time we've had 18 design build iterations for our satellite. So just like the iPhone is iPhone one, two, three, four, five, and those satellites have increased in capability per satellite, per day, in terms of area coverage of imagery by 10,000 X over that period. I am not kidding you. That is what's happened from the first satellite to the last. Just in the last year, we doubled the number of spectral bands exactly to this point of best sub companies build their own hardware. Our customers said we needed these spectral bands. So the next generation of satellites, we added four more spectral bands that addressed various customer needs. So two years ago at our user conference, I announced the SuperDove, which is the next generation of Dove. This one, I announced the fact that we'd already completed daily imaging with that SuperDove fleet. We'd already had seven launches launch about a hundred of these satellites.And they're now operating and getting eight spectral bands that help these extra markets. Those satellites produce five times more than the previous generation of satellites per satellite per day for almost exactly the same cost. Great. That's the kind of trajectory we're on and we're going to continue on. We call it strapping space to Moore's law. Every time there's a better sensor that comes out, every time there's a better processor that comes out, every time there's a better hard drive that comes out, we stuff it into the satellite and put it up. That way, just like you don't want a three year old phone in your pocket, you don't want a three year old satellite in space. We iterate them really fast. We treat them like a server. When one goes out of date, we replenish it. That's why we're on a very rapid trajectory on the satellite side. Patrick: How much do you control versus outsource the component section of a given satellite? In one of the satellites, how much is something that you're taking the best whatever sensor from some other company and incorporating it and you're kind of just the chassis that pieces the best in class together versus the Apple M1 chip or something. I'm trying to think of the right analog where your end to end controlling the component itself. Will: I think it is a bit like Apple. I think that's a good way to think about it. It's all our own bespoke boards. It's all our own bespoke designs, of optics, of camera systems, of radio systems. We do leverage chips. At the chip level, we're leveraging the latest quad core computer. We are leveraging the latest Ymax WiFi components and so on. So we leverage at the chip level, but we've got our own designs at the subsystem level.You're leveraging those chips, but we are totally our own radio design and they're vastly more capable than anything you can buy online. We can get 1.6 gigabits a second, over a thousand kilometer range from our little satellites to these little dishes that we built all around the planet, 48 ground stations. I can't believe we can get 1.6 gigabits a second at a thousand kilometer range with these radios, but that's how much effort we put over 10 years now building the better and better radio systems. I can tell you that about every subsystem, the camera system, the telescopes, the power systems, all the makeup, yes, we buy the chips, but the integrated system is really complicated at the subsystem level and it all has to work together. Patrick: How should we think about complimentary space curves that are compounding in the same way, maybe rocket launches the obvious one. What are the other like driving tech improvements that are riding one of these kind of Moore's law like trends that are interesting and important that will affect the space renaissance beyond imagery? Will: I already mentioned that rockets have come down in cost about four X. Satellites have increasing cost performance about a thousand X over the last five to 10 years. That's already pretty dramatic, right? Very few industries go about a thousand X change in cost performance over a few years. That's like the mainframe, the desktop computer transition in computing. This is like the internet moment for space. There's a lot of opportunities, but it's really complicated. Like I said, it's not for the faint of heart. I would say that rocket piece is quite distinct from the satellite piece. The satellite piece has been driven by Moore's law and general miniaturization of electronics whereas the rocket piece there's just Elon's will to have a reusable rocket, and that's enabled reusable rockets. And that's kind of amazing, but it's a different trend. But I would say again, the thousand X is what's dominating here.They are compounding. So we have a 4,000 X in cost reduction overall, if you like, but the thousand X is what dominates. And that's really about the miniaturization of satellites. That's taking bus size satellites and making them the size of a loaf of bread with the same sort of capabilities. That's staggering. And that's what's really unleashing, as I said, the upshot of what's happening in space is massive new data sets that we collect about the earth and transporting around the earth in the case of Starlink and ourselves, respectively, and that's enabling new and better economic systems, more sustainability and that's what I'm excited about. Patrick: As you go up the stack and more and more of the business is about pre-processed analytics that become more and more valuable, like getting further away from data and closer to knowledge or information, however you want to describe that change moving up the stack, will you then think about almost open sourcing some of the data at the bottom of the stack? Like it strikes me that if this was a nonprofit and you just made this all publicly available, stuff would get built on top of this that would be fascinating if there was no friction or cost to doing it. How do you think about that? Will: I don't think that's the right strategy. I think that the data always has value. And by the way, there's another data company around the corner, it's called Google. But you will notice they have open sourced a lot of their algorithms, their analytics, tensor flow, all the computer vision, modules of this and so on, they haven't open sourced any of their data. There's a real reason for that. The data is where the value is.Algorithms alone have zero value. Data alone has a lot of value. The economists quip that data's the new oil. Obviously there's good things and bad things about that analogy. I don't think that data is dirty like oil and I hope not. And by the way, oil can only be used once, any bit of oil, whereas data, you can pass off to lots of users. So there's an inherent better business aspect of data. But in this sense that data powers like oil does a lot of different sectors, you have to refine it before it's useful to them and it even could get commoditized, but still has huge value. I think that's where we will end up with data. Those that have the best data are going to drive the world and algorithms are super important at going up the value, but without the data, you can't do shit there. And with the data you can. And so the power's in the data. It's very asymmetric. Patrick: Do you anticipate that a lot of businesses build on top of you almost API style, like you would build on topic Twilio or Stripe. And is there a good example of that already? Will: Yeah. The second part I was going to get to about answering your previous question, because I think that we do want to democratize it so that as many people can use it and build those apps, but rather than give it the data for free, we'll still charge the data, but we do want to make it easier and easier to do that in small amounts, get going in easy way. You have a free trial, but we want to enable them the tools that can get going. You can imagine an SDK and thousands of apps being built on top of this data. We are building that right now and that's why we're going public is to have the capital to do this. The other reason, by the way, to get to another question you asked earlier is that a lot of people still don't know about Planet.You seem visually just a tiny bit shocked by the story. And a lot of people are when we tell people about that, they're- Patrick: Like holy shit. Will: No, this is going to be amazing for my industry, whatever your industry, hedge funds, insurance, whatever. Most people still haven't heard of it. I'm telling the story the first time to a lot of people. Okay, was the other advantage of going public is we're going a bit more on a bigger stage. It's not the only reason. And if that was the only reason, I don't think it would be worth going public. But I do think that's a good reason for going public. That is a side benefit. Patrick: Will, this has been such a fascinating conversation. I wish we had hours more to learn about what you're doing. I ask everyone the same closing question. What is the kindest thing that anyone's ever done for you? Will: I should think about that more, but the first thing that comes to my mind is mentorship. I've had some incredible mentors that helped to guide me to where I am today. My PhD supervisor last year won the Nobel Prize in physics. He was an amazing guide. My head boss at NASA who helped me to understand space systems and laws and give me a lot of freedom, and I think of people that have mentored me, that was a gift. Patrick: Will, this has been fantastic. Safe travels today. Pleasure to meet you and learn a lot about Planet. Will: Thanks bye-bye.This site uses cookies to improve your browsing experience.

324,Roelof Botha - Sequoia’s Crucible Moment,Introduction," Patrick: My guest today is Roelof Botha, a partner at one of the world's oldest and most successful venture firms, Sequoia Capital. A few days ago, before I sat down with Roelof, he announced Sequoia's boldest innovation since the firm was founded by Don Valentine in the early 1970s. Going forward, the firm will break from the traditional VC mold of fund cycles and instead, restructure around a single open-ended permanent structure named the Sequoia Fund. In our conversation, we first discussed the details of this change from all different angles and then dive into Roelof's career. We talk about what's changed over the past 20 years, his days at PayPal, what legendary investors he's worked with have had in common, and what he's learned from being involved in businesses like Square, YouTube and Udemy. Please enjoy this great conversation with Roelof Botha.",200
325,Roelof Botha - Sequoia’s Crucible Moment,Re-writing the VC Rulebook," Patrick: So, Roelof, we have the pleasure of speaking the week that Sequoia has announced a massive change to the way that it's going to do business, form its capital, work with entrepreneurs. It's really hard for me to start anywhere but here because it's a big story, and I'm fascinated by the thinking and work that went into it. I know you've been working on it for the better part of the year. Maybe you can begin by rewinding back to the idea itself, where it came from, what problems this change in structure was seeking to address, and then we can kind of tell the history here because if we think about what you do for entrepreneurs as a product, this is a major product upgrade. So, welcome. Maybe tell us what the change is, and bring us back to the reason why you started thinking about it in the first place. Roelof: The venture capital model as it exists today, the operating model was invented in the 1970s. If we go back to the 1960s, financings were actually organized on a per company basis. People didn't have funds, and if you think about it from an economic theory point of view, the transaction costs were enormous. So, people had the idea in the 1970s of organizing a fund, you get investors to pre-commit, you organize the fund, and now, you can much more quickly invest in companies.We're in the business of investing in disruptors who reinvent industries and yet, the operating model for venture has not changed in 50 years. It's kind of backwards. The other problem with the traditional model is we have closed-end 10-year funds. When we look at the reality of our business, we're in the business of finding outlier founders who want to build legendary companies, companies that really stand the test of time. That doesn't reconcile with a 10-year fund life. One of the things that's been very strange for me is we invest in a company at the seed stage when there are two people and a rough idea. We help them find product market for the business model, help them recruit the right executive team, help them navigate crucible moments on the way to building a successful business. We tell the founders that the IPO is a milestone.Why should the IPO be a destination for the investor? I've been on the journey now with several companies where I've been on the board for a decade or more. Why should the IPO mean that the venture investor has to get off the board? We have all the context, all the relationship with the founders, and an ability to help them continue to thrive, but the traditional model created the set of defaults, which is get off the board, distribute shares shortly after the IPO. We've struggled with this over the years. It just didn't seem to reconcile with the reality of our business and the ambition of our founders.The other thing that we realized was that for these great businesses, they continue to compound, and the majority of the value accrues after the IPO. So, if you think about it from the point of view of our LPs ... In Sequoia, we work for what we call great causes. The vast majority of our LPs are endowments, foundations and nonprofits. We're in the business of generating returns for them. So, if so much of the return happens after the company goes public, why are we selling the shares so quickly? The design of the Sequoia Fund is really aimed at meeting both of these objectives, helping founders with a far more durable base of capital and helping our LPs generate better returns. Patrick: Maybe you can tell the story of Square just because the numbers in particular really, really drive the point home of, by any means, it was successful venture investment, but the story sense has been, I think, really important for this kind of structure. So, maybe just use Square as an example to describe this problem. Roelof: We spoke to the company in 2010 and made a commitment to invest. It closed in January 2011. I'm still on the board of the company. When we invested, the price per share, which we invested was at 95 cents or something like that in today's share price terms. By the time the company went public, the IPO price was $9. So, we'd made a 9x return roughly speaking from the time we invested until the IPO. We were very patient in making our distributions. So, on average, I think we distributed it at the price of between 80 and $90 about three to four years after the IPO.It took a little bit of courage post-IPO to continue to back the company, and it wasn't a straight up into the right story. So, by distributing when we did, instead of making the 9x return, which was the return to the IPO, we made a 90x return because we were patient, and we waited. That made a tremendous difference to the return we generated for our limited partners. So, concretely, Square had a IPO price or the total market cap of Square at the IPO was 2.95 billion. Five years after the IPO, it was worth 86 billion, and today, it's worth 115 to 120. Patrick: 120 or something. Yeah. Roelof: If you think about it, it took five years to get to the IPO and to create something that was a startup, so in some sense, worth zero to three, and since then, the company has accumulated far greater total value as a public company in the five years after the IPO. Patrick: Maybe you can talk very specifically about how this new structure will work. Let's say I'm Notre Dame's endowment, which I know famously has been a big Sequoia investor. Past guest Scott Malpass has a long history with your firm. So, I'm Notre Dame, and I'm a big LP of Sequoia's. Historically, I've done some amount into each new set of funds or each fund that Sequoia has put out. What will happen going forward? So, for traditional LP, what'll happen to their past interests? What happens to their future commitments? What are the actual mechanics of this new fund because it's kind of complicated? Roelof: It is. It’s because I wanted to get there, but I think it'll be simple in the end. Some of the background is maybe a little bit more complicated. So, there's an initial phase because the current funds we operate obviously weren't started within the Sequoia Fund fabric. So, what'll happen is when we make distribution decisions from current sub-funds or seed fund or venture fund or growth fund, when we make those distribution decisions in the future, an LP has a decision to make. On an annual basis, they get to decide what percentage would they like to roll over into the Sequoia Fund, and what percentage do they just want distributed to them directly? Either companies' securities that we distribute or cash that we distribute. It could be zero if they want. It could be 100%. It could be 80/20. It's up to them. So, they would then get those shares.The value that goes into the Sequoia Fund would form an account, a capital account for that LP in a pooled vehicle. So, they don't own particular shares. They just own a percentage of the overall value of this new fund. When we organize future funds, so the next time we raise our next seed fund, venture fund, growth fund, they will be under the Sequoia Fund, and the Sequoia Fund will be the sole LP of these future funds. So, when we organize that next day seed fund, Notre Dame will get an allocation invitation to say, would you like to invest in this new seed fund? If they say yes, the funding of their capital commitment to that sub-fund would be drawn from their balance in the Sequoia Fund.This way, it actually radically simplifies the complexity of capital calls that you've had historically. So, an LP typically has to make a capital commitment and then have this unfunded liability. They made a commitment of 10 million, but two million is drawn, eight million can be called at any moment at the investing firm's discretion. Now, we have to manage that cashflow problem for them.Then, within the fund, we've provided for an ability for LPs to redeem. Part of the problem with the legacy model of distributions is it made an all-or-nothing decision for everybody. Made a distribution decision, everybody got their shares. Sadly, LPs generally sold securities when we distributed them. It makes sense. If you're running a $5 billion or an $8 billion endowment and you get shares of some new company you don't know and you don't have an equity desk, what else are you going to do? This way, what would happen is those securities were drawn to the Sequoia Fund, but if you as an LP have a liquidity crunch, you need to fund some new educational campaign or medical research, you can redeem a portion of your balance in the Sequoia Fund on an annual basis so that we tailor liquidity much more to people's needs. Patrick: Let's say I'm a completely new investor that's never invested with Sequoia before, some new endowment that joins the ranks of your LPs. I'm going to be investing just through this fund, right? It's sort of the parent of all the sub-funds. Then, let's say you, like you said, you raise a new seed fund. How much discretion do I have? Sequoia has a variety of different funds. I assume in the past, an LP could pick and choose. They could have some of the seed but none of the growth or whatever the mix might be. So, will that discretion persist? If so, how is that accounted for? Roelof: It would not be good discipline on us if LPs were forced into every single product line. So, what would happen is every time we organize a new vehicle, and we should probably talk later about the possibilities that open up with this new vehicle that we haven't quite delved into, an LP will get an invitation to invest to this new sub-fund whether they're an existing LP or a new LP, and it's their choice. They can choose to not participate in that particular sub-fund. We want to make sure that LPs have that level of control. Patrick: So, the master fund sort of serves as this customizable vehicle for the LP that lets them decide where their dollars go but also creates more liquidity and optionality on the backend and less headache in sort of managing capital calls and things of that nature. Is that sort of a fair summation of the benefits and the flexibility from the LP's perspective? Am I missing anything really important there? Roelof: Everything that you said is correct, but probably the most important thing is our judgment on holding onto some of these very good businesses for longer. I think that's the most important variable, is our ability to drive very good returns for our LPs potentially. We need all the legal disclaimers obviously because past performance is not a guarantee of the future. Our compliance team always reminds me, but if you look at history, they've just been companies that continue to compound.T. Boone Pickens has this quote about how the first billion is the hardest. I don't know if the quote has a parallel to our business, but it's like the example of Square we discussed earlier. It took an enormous amount of effort in the first five years of the company to create something out of nothing and to get it to be a public company, and then it has continued to flourish. So, that's the value of this vehicle, is public investors ... I mean, I have a lot of respect for many of the public investors, but we have an unfair advantage. We've been part of this business since the early days. We are the trusted business partner of the founder. We go to board meetings. We understand the company's product roadmap, its strategic position. It's a real advantage, the texture of the management team, and that can give us confidence to be able to make great investment decisions for our LPs. Patrick: Presumably, if everything follows historical trends, it may not be too long before the Sequoia Fund has a majority of its assets in public equities, which means all the things that you care about in public equities start to matter, volatility, marks to market every day. It's a different world than the traditional venture world. How are you preparing for that and thinking about that volatility? I'm even curious mechanically if the volatility in the public side may affect liquidity in the privates and your need to draw out capital if the market goes down 50% in the publics. I'm just so fascinated by how this will all work together. So, how have you started thinking about that big change that a majority of your assets could be public securities before long? Roelof: Well, in some sense, we have that today because we have been very patient with distributions for many years. So, right now, we hold $45 billion worth of public securities in our U.S., Europe business. $45 billion. I get a weekly report, the team does on what happens to our portfolio. So, we already live with some of this day-to-day volatility, and we get questions from people. Is now the right time to distribute? Is it not the right time to distribute?By the way, that's actually one of the things we need to think about differently, which is we want to think about whole decisions, not distribution decisions because it's a very dangerous default to sell or to distribute. You should have a different default when you are fortunate to partner with really exceptional teams.So, we deal with some of this volatility today. We obviously have a fair market value of our unrealized private companies. It's roughly the same as the value of our public holdings. So, by the way, the 45 billion that we hold today in public holdings has a cost basis of two. You can only pull this off in my mind if you have very high multiples of returns. The only way you get multiples of returns is by partnering with founders that have incredible ambition, and you're patient in letting them continue to scale their businesses. Patrick: You are alluding to some other things that this new structure will likely unlock that aren't possible today. What is the inventory of those things? So, what are the things we haven't yet discussed that make this better, whether it's for founders, for the GPs at Sequoia, for the LPs? What are some of the other ancillary benefits of this new structure? Roelof: So, we've traditionally operated under a set of regulations known as the VC exemption, which constrained us. So, it gives you slightly lighter weights regulatory oversight, but it comes at the cost that no more than 20% of a fund can be invested in the non-primary issuances of shares. So, that's secondaries, crypto, public securities, fund-to-fund investments. All of those are constrained to 20% of your fund size.So, over the last decade, we've had numerous companies that have taken many years to become public. As they've grown, they've created secondary opportunities as outlet valves for employees, which is fabulous. By the way, that's not a new thing. We did the secondary at PayPal in 2001. Not widely reported on, but the secondary we did in the summer of 2001, in my mind, was a key event that helped the team be more patient as we entertained successive offers from eBay to acquire the company. Because we had a little bit of money that we've taken off the table as a team, it made us a little bit more resilient, so I'm always in favor of that.So, as these secondaries have happened in our companies, we've actually not been able to participate in them because our fund structure literally just didn't enable that. Over the years, we've helped support some emerging managers. The Scouts Program that we innovated with over a decade ago, we were the first to launch a Scouts program, all of these types of ideas have been constrained by this VC exemption limit of 20%. So, these are the sort of things that we can revisit. Another big one obviously is crypto. So, we've been active in crypto for five years now. We've made some really good returns already, but again, we're constrained in what we can do with our current fund structure. Patrick: Those are all obviously exciting new avenues and I'm sure a lot of lift from an operational standpoint. How do you think about the comparison of all of what you're doing now to some of the other models that have emerged in the world, often called crossover hedge funds, or going from private up into public? Lots of funds have come from public down into private ever more aggressively, like with insane speed and pace in the last two years. So how would you compare this new structure at Sequoia to the Tigers of the world, the Coatues of the world, these great funds that are now doing both public and private very aggressively? Roelof: I think the true definition of a crossover should probably be the people who can invest at inception and see the company through its full life cycle, rather than starting when the company's already public and going backwards. I'd prefer that definition of a crossover investor. We're customer obsessed and competitive, where at Sequoia there's a lot of competition in the investing business in general. Candidly, I think it's a fantastic thing for founders. And yes, I'd love it if we ran a monopoly business. We do not. But part of the beauty of competition is it makes us innovate. And the ultimate beneficiary of all the innovation that we make as an industry benefits founders and the companies they're building. We're aware of our competitors. We watch what they do. But ultimately, we need to make sure that we really serve our principle customer, the founder. And our secondary customers are LPs. I love the fact that at Sequoia we have LPs that have been clients as long as I've been alive. Patrick: Very cool. How do you think about, with the LPs as a key stakeholder and customer of the business, the change that this represents to fees? In this kind of new model, assuming others will copy you from the venture community, how will fees work in all of this? It seemed pretty straightforward before. You charge a management fee on committed capital, you charge carry above a certain hurdle. That happens typically, like you said, when you choose to distribute in a success case. And now there's more going on. So how will fees work for LPs in this new structure? And do you think it's roughly the same? Is it more aligned? Is it less aligned in any ways? Roelof: So at a sub-fund level, in the future seed venture growth funds that we organize, the fees are as they were. So we're not changing that. There's obviously now an additional pool of capital, this liquid pool. And on that pool we do have a fee structure that we've agreed to with LPs. It has a very low management fee, because there are legitimate expenses we're going to incur in the management of this pool on behalf of our clients. And we've created a incentive fee structure that only rewards us if we outperform a benchmark, which is unusual. Venture funds don't normally have a benchmark return. But the partners in Sequoia are going to invest. At least 5%, probably 10% of the total fund will be money from people who work at Sequoia. And I'm personally committing over a third of my net worth to this new product. I think what's right for LPs will be right for us. We've created fantastic incentive alignment by investing so much of our own money alongside our clients.And we've created a fee structure that only rewards us if we outperform a benchmark. The last thing this should be is a roach motel where we just dump everything and try to accumulate assets. That is not in our nomenclature. We want to drive performance. Patrick: In that sense, will the public portion feel like a hedge fund that has a high watermark of outperformance above the NASDAQ or the S&P or whatever the reference benchmark is? Is that a simplified way of understanding how that piece of it will work? Roelof: That is a fair summary. What we've designed is a three year rolling view on performance. Part of the danger with hedge funds sometimes is that, when they have very short performance windows, it creates perverse incentives, and people leave because it's down and they know that they can't climb their way back up, or things like that. And ultimately we want to manage long term compounding for our clients. We're not interested in taking short term risks. We're also not a hedge fund. Right? This is more of a long only product, because we're not shorting stock. And the remit of this is to hold onto the public positions of companies in which we were private investors, where we have this long standing relationship.We've come up with a fee structure that is very fair. I had indirect feedback from one of our LPs who's brother is a professor at Stanford who came back to me and said, ""Yeah, my sister told me she listened to the calls, and thought that your fee structure was incredibly fair,"" which obviously made me think that maybe we could have charged more. But to talk about that for a second, we have a product for which we don't charge a market clearing price at Sequoia. And capitalists, supposedly. You'd think economic theory suggests you raise prices until you get to a clearance point. And we've chosen not to do that, and we did that deliberately. Sequoia is a place where we want to make sure that our clients do well.The last thing we want to do is charge even more, given that so much of the returns we generate are going to medical research, education, environmental protection, poverty alleviation. These are the sort of causes we work for at Sequoia. And if you visit our offices, our conference rooms are named after our clients. So you walk into the welcome trust room, the Ford Foundation, Stanford University, MIT, the Mayo Clinic, Johns Hopkins University. These are the people we serve, and we want a constant reminder of that inside our office.",4940
326,Roelof Botha - Sequoia’s Crucible Moment,How The World Has Changed," Patrick: How do you think about the evolving landscape of capital in this space from the founder perspective? You said earlier, ""We're not in a monopolistic business here."" There's incredible amount of capital looking to invest in the best founders in the world. And hopefully part of that will be that the supply of founders will grow. Supply will rise to meet the demand. But unquestionably, the cost of capital for early stage companies and for growth stage companies is extremely low relative to history. How do you think that impacts all of this? The rate of return that we might expect from these sorts of investments, which has been awesome for the last decade, but the cost of capital just seems to change dramatically. So what is your take on this shift and this change and how it affects things? Roelof: Well, interest rates are so low globally. Somebody gave me the statistic a few weeks ago that there are $16 trillion in developing countries that is earning a negative nominal yield. Patrick: Nominal. It's not even real Roelof: Nominal. Not real. Nominal. You leave money in your bank account and you are charged and you are left with less money at the end of the year than you started. It is literally better off to keep money under your mattress. I mean, that's kind of bizarre. When you deal with an environment where what we saw in 2020 was incredible monetary and fiscal policy that staved off a massive recession because of COVID. And there's a question mark about whether maybe it was excessive, has that led to too much liquidity. Fair questions, but we're dealing with livelihoods and human welfare. So if I had to err on one side, I probably would've erred on the same side of being a little bit excessive. But that leads to this low interest rate. So that puts pressure on returns in every single asset class, including this. Including venture capital.I think the other thing which really has dawned on people is just the scale of what's possible today is so different, because of the way the technology infuses everything. And it's hard to remember this. When I was at PayPal two decades ago there were 200 million people on the planet with internet access. 200 million. And the vast majority of them were on dial-up. So you think about the kind of capabilities we have today, where technology touches every person and every industry. No wonder that if you build a company that works, it can address a global audience and gain traction very quickly. These businesses can grow so much faster than they ever could before. And that yields some of these spectacular outcomes in valuations. It's natural that those sort of returns should attract more capital and drive down the cost of capital. So from that point of view it is a wonderful thing for entrepreneurs.I'd say the thing just to be a little bit more nuanced about that in terms of the choices entrepreneurs face, is when do you want help, when do you want a business partner, and when do you want transactional capital? And there are many time when the better decision when you fundraise is to view it as a recruiting decision, not a fundraising decision. Who is this person who you're going to let onto your board, who's going to help you build a business? Do they have the tribal knowledge and expertise and the team behind them who can help you succeed? Because that matters more than exactly how much you own probably.We had Jack Dorsey at a founder event recently, and he talked about how he gave back equity to the company at Square twice. He gave back 1% of the company. Not 1% of his own equity, 1% of the company, because he wanted to replenish the pool so that we can go and hire more great talent to help the company succeed. And his insight was, ""I wanted to have a smaller piece of something that was really successful and really made a big impact, rather than hoarding as much equity for myself."" That's what Jack has done twice. And I think he's been pretty darn successful. When a founder approaches a fundraising decision like that there are certain points where it is more important to be picky about the partner you work with. Patrick: If you think about today's landscape, setting aside the cost of capital and the crazy funding environment, which, look, is great for the world I think. There's a lot more businesses being built and talented people building them with more access to capital. I think that outcomes will be fantastic. How else do you see today's landscape as different than the long past in which you've invested predominantly here in the US? What is most notably new or different about your interaction with founders or companies or opportunity sets? What are the winds of change, so to speak, today? Roelof: I'd say one of the biggest changes I've noticed over the last 15 years is the scale of ambition of founders. And maybe some of that deals with people seeing examples and role models that they can follow. It's always been powerful for me. I think most people have this experience. When you've seen somebody else accomplish something, it's sort of like an existence proof from science. It shows you it can be done and it gives you a template. Part of what we lamented 15 years ago was that founders didn't have enough ambition. And sometimes we would sell too early when they were onto something great. And I was guilty of that myself. PayPal was a 1.5 billion acquisition, and today it's a company worth over $300 billion. And Mike Moritz was on our board. And Mike, I think, saw the potential and pushed us and challenged us to think longer term.And what did we know? What did I know? And I made the wrong decision, and didn't quite fathom how much potential PayPal had as a business. That has changed. And I see founders today far more patient than they ever were, far more ambitious to build companies of consequence, and also far more mission-driven than they used to be. And not only is this in America, I've now started to see this in Europe. I think this was especially true of European founders maybe 10, 15 years ago, where they got to a certain scale and it seemed like that was good enough. That was a great accomplishment. And now the founders really have global aspirations. Patrick: How does this most change their behavior? You've mentioned longer time horizons and bigger ambitions, so maybe some of that just speaks for itself. But does this manifest in different ways of doing business? Or different ways that, as a board member, you guide companies in their early years? Like you have to act differently with that scope of ambition in mind in years one through three than you would if you were going for a smaller outcome? Roelof: I think it does lead to a different outcome, because the horizon is different. You don't take shortcuts, you don't use duct tape, you try to architect things properly. I think teams are more mindful of who they recruit. Look, and sometimes there are people that are wonderful to help you go from year one to year three, but maybe they're not the people to get you from year three to year five. Or they can help you get you 100,000 in revenue, but they maybe can't get you from there to a billion in revenue. And so I see founders being a lot more deliberate about thinking about the composition of their management teams, about their willingness to invest in the next generation of products that might yield benefits down the road.Going back to Square as an example. Square Cash didn't exist for the first four or five years of the company's existence. And it's a huge business today with 10 of millions of users. And Jack has this phrase about companies having multiple founding moments. And how do you encourage the team and provide that kind of platform for creativity to blossom within your organization? That's the kind of thing that I've seen change, where people are just far more ambitious, they let more ideas blossom.",1740
327,Roelof Botha - Sequoia’s Crucible Moment,Roelof's Investment Framework," Patrick: I love that we're talking during a week when Zuckerberg changed the name of a trillion dollar business and is having one of those founding moments himself. Like you said, the examples that are out there now is almost like the classic four minute mile thing. Like once someone broke the four minute mile, then all these other people started doing it. Seems like there's something similar going on here. When you first meet, because I know you invest all the way down at seed right at the beginning of a company, and series A and beyond, when you're first meeting with a business, with a founder, or a founding team, what are your goals in the earliest meetings? Like what are you trying to learn? What are you trying to suss out? How do you go about doing that? Because I'm sure you've gotten as many reps as just about anybody. So what matters to you in those early meetings with very young companies? Roelof: Difficult question, but a fun question. Every meeting is both buying and selling, just like every good interview. If I walked into that meeting feeling as though my job is to find the flaws and to trip up the founder and to be the sole person who's judging, if I turn around and I'm actually in interested in partnering with them, they may have been turned off so much by my behavior they wouldn't choose me. So there's this delicate balance of how do you ask questions in an engaging way so that you're going to answer some of your diligence questions, but you also build trust. And candidly, I've actually found that that in of itself is valuable. And founders come back to us and say, ""You ask the toughest questions, and that's why I want to work with you, because you sharpened my thinking. You helped me think differently about my business. And that's the kind of thinking that I want for the future. I don't just want somebody who's going to be a cheerleader, patting me on the back for everything.""So it's being engaged. It's being prepared. I love to understand the eureka moment. What happened? How did lightning strike? How did you think of this problem? What did you encounter in the world? Because I encounter a lot of problems. It doesn't motivate me to start a company. Sloth kicks in. So there's something that happened where you were so frustrated as a founder with the state of the world that it motivated you to want to go and build a company. So one of the boards I'm on is a company called Natera. It's a public company in the bioinformatics space. They have the leading technology in the world for doing non-invasive prenatal testing. The founder and I met in high school. And he eventually came to Stanford, he did a PhD in electrical engineering. And in 2002 his sister gave birth to a baby that died within a week from a genetic condition that was undetected during her pregnancy.And Matt went back to Stanford to learn everything he could about biology and genetics, because he thought that people needed better care. In the 21st century he found it shocking that we didn't have better technology to help families have healthy children. That was the motivation. Yes, he was a friend of mine, but you hear him talk about the motivation for starting a company like that. It's emotional. And you understand that this person is mission driven, and then you understand all the things that they did to uncover the nuances of why this is a problem they're going to dedicate maybe the rest of their life to. So I love understanding that eureka moment, that insight. Patrick: How much do you want to or need to understand the potential business model or revenue model of a business in the early stages? It strikes me that so many companies have figured that out later on. So how much do you think about that? How important is that, especially when a company is very young, to you in your evaluation? Roelof: Hardly ever. I say that purposefully flippantly just to make the point. I think about value creation before value capture. And it's very rare that a company creates or delivers an enormous amount of value and fails to build a good business. Now sometimes, to build a great business rather than a good business, you need some ingenuity in your business model. So things like Google's second price auction, where they leverage research from Stanford's economics department to help inform the way that they build the business model for Google, not just building great technology. That was a very careful business model innovation that helped turn Google into what could have been a good business into a great business. But if you deliver value, usually you can figure out the rest. So I always start with that value creation piece. So what was the insight? What is the problem that you're addressing? And why is your solution compelling and unique in addressing that problem?Even if it's compelling, if it's not unique there're going to be lots of competitors. And then you're probably going to struggle to build a distinctive business. So it's that unique and compelling value proposition that I look for. Patrick: On the other side of the coin, what are the things that would most commonly disqualify a company from your interest early on? And I'm especially interested not in like the obvious nos, but in this hard to decide no category. What would typically be the things that tip someone just out of your decision making process? Roelof: You can say no to every single company. That's part of the challenge. And Don Valentine used to give us this quote, when he was still alive with the partnership, that we're in the business of making investments, we're not in the business of not making investments. Because we'd have these conversations and you'd find all the no reasons for every single company. It's too late, it's too early, this isn't the right team, the market's too small. Yeah, but maybe the market will grow. So anyways, there's obviously a very long list of reasons.I'd say the one that probably is most challenging for me is if the founders come across as mercenary rather than missionary. If it feels like they're building a business for the sake of building a business or for the sake of getting rich, rather than having encountered a problem that they sincerely are passionate about solving, and that that's the thing that's going to keep them motivated. Because if you're a mercenary, you wilt in the face of adversity.",1413
328,Roelof Botha - Sequoia’s Crucible Moment,"Square, YouTube, Unity, & MongoDB"," Patrick: There's four companies in particular that, just preparing for our conversation, you've had a ton of experience with, been on the board, been a major investor. And I'm just really curious to learn a bit about the lessons that these companies have taught you, watching them build over the long term. So the first is actually Square. So it's kind of an obvious one that we've referenced many times already. But I haven't asked this specific question. So watching Square grow, and it's been quite an interesting like evolving story from the cheap seats, what has that business and the leadership there most taught you that maybe you didn't know prior to your experience with Square? Roelof: It's a hard question because there's a fair amount I knew about payments and about the financial services industry, which is part of why I was so passionate about us wanting to make this investment. One of the things that's really surprised me is Square's ability to pull off building a big consumer business, even though the initial DNA of the company was addressing small businesses as customers. The ability for the company to have the second founding moment in that case, and they've had others as well, but this ability to give birth to a brand new consumer-facing cash app product after having built this expertise in SMBs, to me, is absolutely remarkable. And the ability to give life to this new idea. Because most organizations are their own worst enemies. It's their own organization that often kills these nascent ideas. The ability for Square to pull that off, to me, was absolutely remarkable. Patrick: What's the most exciting about payments looking forward, thinking back here to the early PayPal days. You've been in and around this part of the world for a very long time. Seems like payments is just this thriving, fascinating area of technology and technology investing. What is interesting about today's payments landscape and what might be interesting in the future? Roelof: The beauty of payments is it helps grease the wheels of commerce. I know that's a very overused terminology. But there's something really valuable in that insight where it makes commerce easy. It's one of the things that we found after the eBay acquisition of PayPal, there was tighter integration between that payments product of PayPal and eBay. It accelerated commerce on eBay. Just think about that for a second. PayPal was pretty darn successful before the acquisition, but by making it slightly better, it just totally accelerated commerce. That's the beauty of what payments in general can do for the economy, for GDP growth. It just makes commerce easier. And so when I look around, I still see many instances where payments are broken. International wire transfers. If I want to send a birthday gift to one of my family members in South Africa. That's an arduous process.I love the promise of smart contracts, where you can embed a cryptocurrency with a payments event to make things far more seamless. We made an investment in Filecoin, for example. So if you think about how storage works today, you consume storage on S3, they measure how much you use, and then you get an invoice and you pay it with a credit card bill and you pay 2%, whatever, transaction fees for that. It's kind of cumbersome. And what you get with Filecoin instead is this ability for the use of storage to lead to the payment for it automatically. It's fully integrated. There's no need for subsequent invoicing and disputes. It's just fully embedded in the experience. And so I think that the promise, in my mind, of some of the DeFi technology in enabling smart contracts and lowering transaction costs, to me, is absolutely fascinating. Patrick: I'll just jump to my other three and then ask a preamble question. So the other three I picked out were Unity, MongoDB, and YouTube. How often does the story of a company that you get interested in fundamentally boil down to lowering frictions with technology? Roelof: Very often. It's little bit trite and the word democratizing gets used to the point where maybe it loses its power. But so many instances that it's been about lowering the entry barrier. And it's not new. You go back to Wells Fargo as a bank. Part of what Wells Fargo did 150 years ago is make banking accessible to the everyday person. And so many technologies have done the same. So PayPal was about enabling merchants who literally no credit card processor would take them on. And we enabled that. Square did the same with the initial white Reader. They enabled all these merchants to accept payments who otherwise couldn't. Unity has enabled creators who couldn't afford expensive tools with something that is easy to enter with. So I think that's a huge part of technology's lowering costs and improving accessibility. Patrick: Unity is a great opportunity to ask about this week's theme in the world of business and markets, which is the metaverse. And this concept that we're doing it right now. You just showed me this amazing product. ... is the name of it, which is this amazing way to present information over Zoom. There's just more and more of our activity that's happening virtually. How do you think about Unity, the role that it plays in this whole trend? And again, what you've most learned from watching that business grow and thrive? Roelof: Unity is definitely part of the metaverse conversation. And in some sense, the way that Unity thinks about the metaverse is it's real-time 3D interactive technology. Part of what we're doing right now is real-time interactive, but it's a 2D representation. It's not fully 3D and immersive. And that's the promise of what Unity can enable with their 3D technology. Something like 70% of the top thousand games on the App Store are built on Unity. They've got use cases in manufacturing and auto. So people are designing buildings and cars and things like that using Unity so they can get that 3D interactive experience. And we also have gaming experiences or metaverse-like experiences that people are building on Unity. And Unity is this engine that can power so much of it.I'd say the key difference between Unity and many of the others in the metaverse conversation is that Unity fundamentally believes in an open ecosystem. And I think there's a real danger, just like in the early days of the internet. People are quick to forget that we were at risk in the late nineties of collapsing the open internet into a Microsoft internet with Internet Explorer. Let's not forget. That was just 20 years ago. And if DoJ hadn't prosecuted Microsoft, I think Web 2.0 wouldn't have happened. There's a real risk in my mind that the metaverse also collapses down to big companies that want to control it in a closed ecosystem. And so Unity, we fundamentally believe in trying to build an open ecosystem. I think that's the way that great ideas flourish. Patrick: Can you say maybe just a little bit more detail about that open versus closed and what it means practically? So another very hot topic today is the decentralized and open versus the centralized and closed mindset. And it seems like history is sort of a pendulum between those two things, whether that's governments or in technology or whatever. Just say more about why the open stance might lead to better outcomes for the world at large. Why is that true? Roelof: The downside of openness is interoperability. And so if things are very open, then the pipes between technologies may be brittle and things don't work seamlessly. But that's a technology challenge that can be solved. And that's part of what Unity can provide with their system. So when developers work on Unity, a game or an application that they developed works on every hardware device out there. If you build your application in Unity, it'll work on iOS, it'll work on Android, it'll work on macOS, it'll work on Windows, it'll work on the PlayStation, it'll work on Xbox. It works on all these different platforms. Because Unity has done the hard work for the developer to understand how to work with these different hardware ecosystems and different operating systems and different interfaces.And so as long as there are companies like Unity that make that possible, when it's open, you take advantage of the creativity of everybody out there. Because the danger, when you get closed ecosystems, is they become monopolistic and, candidly, monopolies don't need to innovate because they have monopoly power by definition. And so I think that's the trade-offs that you face. Is the technology good enough to give you a good experience? Otherwise, consumers will choose closed systems if it's far better from a end to end experience point of view. Patrick: How similar is the story with YouTube and what you've learned there? Because again, this seems like, to use your word, democratized access, a certain type of content creation. It's become this unbelievable asset inside of Google. And the stats around like how much time people spend on there are just staggering. What have you learned about that business specifically and what it taught you about, I don't know, content, or UGC, or the internet at large? Roelof: Oh, there's so many learnings. I also want to be mindful that it was fabulous to be involved early. So there were just the three founders who were friends of mine, colleagues of mine from PayPal days when they were in Chad's garage in Menlo Park. And they actually took up in Sequoia's office at the outset. So we were their first business address, which is fabulous, because I got to work with them every single day for the first couple of months. So that was an incredible experience in the forwarder stages to get the company to a critical mass. But I also want to give credit to Google and the team there for everything they've done to turn it into an incredible global success. Because for the majority of the company's life, it has been managed by Google and by the executives there. And Google's funding of it, infrastructure, the amount of resources they've given it really enabled it to flourish. I just want to make sure I give credit where credit is due.I think it also built a very open system and it gave a voice to so many people. It's really remarkable, if you go back 25 years, if either of us or anybody out there wanted to have their voice be heard, what were your choices? You write a letter to the newspaper and hope that they publish your plea and ad in the classifieds and hopefully that gets attention? You didn't have a platform. And this idea that at YouTube, you can give this platform for all these creators was absolutely incredible. And even in the early days, we spoke about this. Chad and Steve and Jawed, we talked about how YouTube could be a platform for creators. And we thought about what we could do to enable creators to connect with either brands to help support them or for them to be able to engage in commerce so that they can make their livelihoods on YouTube. And it's become true. It's absolutely magical to see what it's done. Obviously I wish we could have kept the company going a little bit longer as an independent business, but what a wonderful influence it's had on the world. Patrick: The reason I chose the last one, MongoDB, is hopefully for sort of a window into your thoughts on the world of developers today. The fact that all of this technology we're investing in and talking about so much and spending our daily lives on is ultimately built mostly by software developers and that the tools available to them have proliferated. And there's been incredible businesses built in this space, including MongoDB. You don't necessarily have to talk just specifically about the company. I'm even more interested in sort of your thoughts on the world of developers, how much runway there is here, whether that's something that you're actively interested in and your thoughts on it today. Roelof: We had a strategic insight or sort of a theme that developed over a decade ago and we internally called it the rise of the developer. And that informed our investment in Unity, which also faces developers, GitHub, MongoDB, Confluent, many of these other businesses. It's about the rise of the developer. And the reason is that there are about 25 million people on the planet who write software for a living. 25 million people. It is a staggeringly small number of people on whom we depend to build all these wonderful products that we use today. And so whenever you can deliver technology or products that help those developers become more productive, it has a massive force multiplier effect on the world. Patrick: I think that the story with Mongo specifically, especially at second act with Atlas, this product that they've grown and now is, I don't know what percent of the business it is, but it's kind of staggering. Roelof: It's about half. Patrick: Yeah. I mean, it's incredible in a short period of time. What have you learned there about just the team and how they're able to manage that? And this is kind of a question about second acts. Like how do companies successfully pull this off? You've seen a lot of these second acts, these second founding moments, or maybe even third. Is there anything shared and common between those key moments that you could point to? Roelof: Firstly, the focus on the developer, making the developer's life easier. The founders, Dwight and Eliot, were at DoubleClick before they started Mongo. And they experienced some of the challenges of database scalability and complexity with traditional relational databases. And that's what inspired them to build a product for themselves as developers. They wanted a database with a schema that was different, a NoSQL schema, a document-based, that gave them more flexibility to build applications. The founding inspiration, back to the Eureka moment comment we talked about earlier. So that's what inspired them. They were born in an era that sort of was right at the cusp of cloud computing. And so initially they used an open source approach and it was a product that people would download and build applications locally.And then they faced what I call a crucible moment decision. Companies, in my mind, face one to two crucible moment decisions a year. And the challenge they have is identifying that it is actually a crucible moment. Because sometimes your head's down, focused on all the execution issues in your business. And so you need a little bit of perspective and distance to see a crucible moment. And then you have to get the decision right.So I remember that, as a board member, we were able to bring the learnings from what we were seeing in Silicon valley and what was happening with cloud computing to make sure that moving to the cloud was a conversation that really had the focus of management. And we ended up recruiting an outside board member who was a former AWS executive who could help the company unlock getting to the cloud. Because sometimes, even if you know it's a crucible moment, even if you make the right decision, it's hard to change your habits.It's almost like when you learn a new sport and you don't quite get it right because your body's got a habit from a different sport. You need to retrain your muscles for this new activity. And so the company went through this challenge of trying to figure out how to become a cloud business. And how do you compensate your salespeople? What exactly are the product features and how do you continue to invest in your legacy product versus the new product and deal with all those challenges? And Dave and the team have done a spectacular job. And as I mentioned earlier, it's about 50% of the company's revenue today.And again, the focus was simplicity, because for the average developer, using Mongo on prem meant that you had to download it, you had to provision a server. It just requires a lot more work than consuming a database as a service, where we take care of figuring out how to scale it for you, how to shard it for you. It helps you focus on what you're good at as a developer and you don't have to do what is known as undifferentiated heavy lifting.",3542
329,Roelof Botha - Sequoia’s Crucible Moment,"Board Members, Legendary Investors, and Crucible Moments"," Patrick: Is your primary job as a board member around these crucible moments? Like is that how you think about the highest and best use of a good board member, is being sure to be on top of those things and help founders guide themselves through those things? Roelof: It's one of the ones that I focus on. I think sometimes you have other board members who are very good at specific operational or functional domains. So sometimes the company may have a founder or founders who have product technology experience, but now they need to figure out go to market, and they've never built a sales team before in their lives. And you can have a board member who maybe doesn't focus as much as I do on crucible moments, but they're really good at helping a company build a sales force and understand how to build that go-to-market motion, which is a little bit more functionally targeted than broad and strategic.And the thing about a board is this complement of different skill sets that we bring together. Mine happens to be this love of these strategic moments, these crucible moments. There's a book I read many years ago called The Hinge Factor. And the subtitle for the book was How Chance and Stupidity Have Changed the Course of History. And so I always look for these key moments where companies might have taken a fork in the road left or right. And it has a huge bearing on the ultimate outcome. Patrick: Say a bit more about your ability to hunt for crucible moments. It seems like that, in and of itself, is a talent that you could have developed over time. How do you do that? What are the actual things you're doing to refine or improve your odds of successfully identifying a crucible moment inside of a business? Roelof: Some of that is experience, honestly, where you're able to translate things that you've seen from other situations to be able to see around the corners. I remember when I first joined Sequoia, I would shadow some of the more senior partners to board meetings and we'd debrief after a board meeting. And I remember one time, both Mike Moritz and Doug Leone said this is what's going to happen. And I had no idea why they came to that conclusion. And then six months later, exactly what they predicted turned out to be true, because they'd built up this capacity because that's the business we're in, which is what we're trained to do.So some of that comes with experience. And then a lot of it comes from being very deliberate. And I think the danger is that you show up for a board meeting preparing lightly, taking it very casually. I think of a board meeting as a very important event. The amount of preparation that goes into it. Did I read all the material and then did I take time to think, really think? And so one of the notes I have in my Evernote folder is, for every single company I work with, what are the three most important things that need to happen over the next six months? Because that declutters you from the little things that come up. If this company is going to succeed, what are the three most important things? Patrick: When you think about like this idea that different board members represent different skills in the boardroom, different utility to the company, I'm sure the same answer kind of applies to what makes for great investors. But given that you've worked with Mike Moritz and Doug Leone and Don Valentine, and Jim Getz, and so many other legendary hall of fame type investors, what would you say is common between them, if anything? What is the DNA of a great investor of this type, in your opinion? Roelof: Curiosity. Patrick: Simple as that. Roelof: I try to make it succinct sometimes, because hopefully it provides emphasis too. There are obviously a lot of attributes. You need analytical skills to be able to understand diligence. You need judgment of people. You need an intuition for where markets can go. You need imagination. If you go and read the YouTube memo, which is now in the public domain. It required imagination to back three people with a product that 9,000 people had registered for. That's what YouTube was at the time we first invested, and I wrote the memo for it. So you need imagination. You need all those things. But the most important thing is curiosity. Are you interested in learning about new things? Are you interested in meeting new people? Are you interested in listening to their idea for a company and how they're going to change the world? And if you lose that curiosity, then you become jaded. And then you should probably stop working as an investor. Patrick: What makes for a fantastic investment memo? Roelof: Clarity. Clarity and conviction. The ability to explain things clearly. I'm sure you've experienced this. I work with a person called Shankar Balasubramanian, who is a professor of chemistry at Cambridge University. He invented the chemistry behind Next-Generation Sequencing, and he founded a company called Solexa that was bought by Illumina and it forms the backbone of the Next-Generation Sequencing products. He is absolutely gifted and brilliant. And he has an ability to explain incredibly complicated topics in a way that I can understand. And that to me is the gift, when you can boil down a complicated business and technology so clearly that anybody can read it and understand it.That, to me, implies that you have command of it. So clarity is important. And then, do you take a stand because a lot of people have very good analytical skills and they can tell you on the one hand and on the other hand. But our business is about making decisions, and it's never binary. There's always uncertainty and you don't have perfect diligence. And so, you have to make a call when it's unclear. Is that a 60/40 decision or a 55/45 decision? So you need that conviction, that willingness to stick your neck out and to make a recommendation. Patrick: Is there an investment memo, that you didn't write, that stands out as the most memorable that you've ever read? Roelof: Oh, there's several of my partners that are much more gifted than I am at writing. So I admire so many of their memos. Jim Gates's memo for WhatsApp was fantastic. Pat Grady's memo for ServiceNow and Zoom was fantastic. Alfred Lin's memo for DoorDash. These are all example of incredible memos. Mike Moritz obviously takes the cake because he has- Patrick: Best writer. Roelof: He's the best writer in the partnership by a mile. We had an event for our founders recently, and Doug was joking how, when he first joined Sequoia, Michael would say something about an investment. And then he would quickly flip through a dictionary. And that's how I feel sometimes when I read Michael's memos. I totally admire his gift of writing. Patrick: Given that in, I think 2017 or thereabout, you took over added responsibilities to sort of oversee Sequoia's US franchise. I know you've been the driving force behind this major change to the way that they all do business here in the US, and maybe eventually China and elsewhere. How do you think about the differences in skillset or attention required to do that job versus the traditional general partner, pure investor job? What has been most notable about this last couple of years, and the change and sort of elevation and role of what you're focused on? Roelof: It becomes a leadership challenge more than an investing challenge. Starting to think much more about the assembly of a team. Do we have the right composition? Do we have the right individuals? Are they working in harmony? Are we working well together? Because we have an early stage team and a growth team, how do we make sure that there's fabulous chemistry between those? As a business, we've made a decision to add significant operating capabilities to our organization. The venture business was a bit of a cottage business 25 years ago, where largely, it was a small number of people making investing decisions, and that was it. And today we have a much more complicated organization. We have a marketing team, a community team. We have a talent organization that helps our founders recruit. We have a technology team inside Sequoia that helps us build technology for us to leverage. The business has just become a lot more complex.And so, the job as a leader is to make sure that we have good operating teams, and that they work well together. And that we also work well together with the investing team. And so, in some sense, probably glub but it's the same as the job of any other leader of an organization, is you need to spend more time thinking about the people issues than maybe the product issues. Patrick: I love the point that you made earlier that the major change is that founders have evolved the scope of their ambition. And I'm curious if the same applies to you and the firm. And I'm curious both here about the stewardship of the brand. It's obviously one of the best known investing brands out there. It's been around a long time. It's got a storied history, but it's got a long future too. How do you think about the brand, what it means, evolving it in the right directions, and the scope of your ambition? Roelof: Well firstly, let me take the brand question. Don made a very deliberate decision to not call it Valentine capital in the 1970s when almost every other professional services firm, law firms, accounting firms, et cetera, put the names to the founders on the door. And there's a lot of subtlety that goes into that decision, and also the choice of the Sequoia tree that lives for thousands of years. He wanted to build a partnership that would outlive him. And when you do that, you recruit people that don't work for you, but work with you and that inherit the business.And so when I was being recruited to Sequoia, I had a sense in which I would be able to play a big role in the partnership down the road if I was successful. And I wasn't just joining to work for somebody else and to be their servant or their lackey. We've structured Sequoia to essentially be a partnership in perpetuity within the bounds of what the law permits, so that we all view it as our job to serve. And my title is steward, which is a word that connotes servitude and being in service of others. And we view Sequoia as a platform that provides us with an ability to serve founders and to serve our LPs. And that our job is to leave the partnership in a better position than we found it.So my job is to help recruit the next generation team at Sequoia that will take over the partnership from the current set of leaders. And their duty in turn will be to keep this platform going in service of future founders and the LPs that form the core of our business. And so, that has to be the north star for us. That is our mission. Everything we do is in service of that. And so that defines our ambition. We want to be part of the most interesting, most enduring businesses that are created. We want to be there to help these founders navigate to success. And we think that we have a unique set of experiences and people at Sequoia that can give you an unfair edge to succeed.",2576
330,Roelof Botha - Sequoia’s Crucible Moment,How to Think About the World," Patrick: Back to your point on curiosity. What are you most curious about today in the world? What is the most astonishing, interesting set of trends that has your attention? Roelof: Genetic engineering. I am absolutely enamored with this idea that biology becomes more programmable with the advent of all the genetic engineering capabilities that we're inventing. And at the one hand, one of them became common vernacular with MRNA, thanks to COVID. On the other end, you have technologies like CRISPR that have been talked about now for a few years. But I think the promise of precision genetic engineering is going to be so fundamental to the future of the world. I find that fascinating. Patrick: What does the world of technology, I always love Kevin Kelly's idea that, I think he called it the technium that there wasn't any separate technology. It was all sort of part of this massive tech mass, technium thing. And that, that thing wants certain things at any given time. It is asking for certain inputs to allow itself to grow and mature. What do you think technology wants most today? Roelof: I think it wants sustainability. And I think it wants, depending on how you phrase the question, I think technology wants to show that it can improve the lives of most people, not some people. And that it truly can make our planet a better place for humanity. Patrick: What are the biggest roadblocks to that? I think immediately of the 25 million developers, we probably need 250 million or something. So that's one. But what are the things in the way of us going faster towards that goal? Roelof: Accurate measurement, may be one. I think part of the problem generally is, people don't have the right information with which to make better decisions. A huge failing for us as a society in general with climate is that it's an externality that we don't internalize. I mean, it says it in the word, right? It's an externality. So therefore, you don't take it into account. So on some level, you can make your eyes roll over when you hear about ESG and think, well, all I should worry about is profits. But the pursuit only of profits comes at the expense, potentially, of our livelihood as a species if we don't account for these externalities. And what if those externalities were properly priced? If externalities of pollution were properly priced into coal, maybe we would change the balance of our energy production more quickly to more sustainable sources.As much as I'm a capitalist and an economist, there are many ways in which the market system isn't perfect and we need to compliment it with sound institutions that enable it to flourish. Now, as a student of Paul Romers at Stanford, Paul was a Nobel laureate ultimately, and he talked about the power of institutions. Even things like, when he told me this thing about bankruptcy, which I'd never quite anticipated. And he explained how the institution of bankruptcy was so critical to the success of capitalism in America. And I really struggled initially with this idea. And then he unpacked it, and he explained how an efficient bankruptcy process freed up resources to be redeployed. And we see this in Silicon valley. Companies that don't work, the offices, their people get redeployed and they go on to do other interesting things. So I just think there are a bunch of ways in which the market hasn't quite solved some of these problems. And we need to figure out how to bring those to the forefront for business leaders so they can make better decisions. Patrick: I have a couple of closing framing questions for you in terms of just how to think about the world. And I've seen you talk about these elsewhere and I'm fascinated for your view. The first is the difference between an accountant's mindset, and the mindset of an actuary. You were an actuary prior to your work at PayPal, beginning of your career. What's the difference between these two mindsets? And where is one appropriate and not the other? Roelof: So the quip that my professor gave in undergraduate was that accountants are trained to think a year in arrears, and actuaries are trying to think 20 years into the future. Because accountants close the books from last year and actuaries have to think about building products for life insurance, which many times the products really do stretch into the decades, and a mistake can compound very powerfully.And thought it was interesting that I didn't quite realize until I got to Sequoia was the way in which that helped me with imagination. Because most of the time I've made poor decisions is because my horizon was too short. I didn't imagine compounding. And if you've read Ray Kurzweil's books, this idea that compounding doesn't come to us intuitively. Because in the pre-historic man, compounding didn't really help us relatively. Didn't help you find food, did it? If you added 1.1 to the power N, it starts to become a very large number when N grows. It isn't intuitive for any of us. And yet it is so valuable when you think about how businesses can grow and evolve. And it gets back to the creation of the Sequoia fund, is that people underestimate ability for really successful businesses to compound sustainably. Patrick: What is the difference between talent and genius? Roelof: To me, genius is more about the inspiration. Talent, to me, is a little bit more about perspiration. You can have a talented executive in a particular category that can help you take N to N plus one. You need genius to go from zero to one. Patrick: And I assume you need both. It's probably the punchline. Roelof: To be successful as a business, absolutely. And I think it's one of the narratives that I don't love in general, where we overweight any particular attribute. It's just the founder that is celebrated, when the founder depended on a team to succeed. Just the engineers, when the sales people had to figure out how to sell the product and generate revenue to turn it into a good business.And maybe it harkens back to my time growing up in South Africa, playing rugby. Part of the beauty in rugby, in my mind, is that it's a complete team sport. And there are no measurement of individual metrics. No one walks off a rugby field saying, ""Oh, I gave five passes or I ran a hundred yards."" It's just, did we win as a team or not? You don't even count whether or not you gave the pass to the teammate who scored the try. It just matters that we scored the try and we won as a team. And part of the beauty of a rugby team is, the players have such varied positions that you have players that are small. You have players that are big. You have players that are tall, you have players that are fast. And they just come in all shapes and sizes. And what makes a winning team isn't just one type. You need the complement.And so when I think about building businesses, you need that complementarity, and you need to respect and appreciate the different talents that people bring to bear, rather than just praising just the quarterback. I tried to speak American for a second. Don't just praise one particular position, because it's a team sport. Patrick: Jives so perfectly with the notion of stewardship, of an investment business serving something greater. I didn't know that there was no stats like that, traditional stats, in rugby. That's a really cool concept. Are there any closing principles of great business building that we haven't covered yet that you think are especially important? Roelof: One I'll steal from Larry Summers. He's on the board with us, the former treasury secretary of the US. He's on the board at Sequoia. And he introduced me to this framework of a pre-parade and a pre-mortem. And we actually have made it a default in our investment memos. And it's something that we take to portfolio companies, where we ask them, imagine three years, sometimes five years into the future. And you've been fabulously successful. What are the conditions that led to that? What decisions did you make that led to that success? And then conversely, write your pre-mortem. What are all the things that went wrong?There's a version of this in Amazon and the way that they write press releases when they start to do product development, because it's thinking about that moment of success and what does it actually encapsulate? And the beauty of it is it clarifies the mind to focus on first order issues. I've seen management teams change direction and change prioritization on reflecting on these pre-parade, pre-mortem dimension. And we use it at Sequoia repeatedly at our offsites. Imagine the venture business in a decade, and Sequoia is gone. We presided over the decline of Sequoia, this team, the people here in this room, it was us. What happened? What did we not do? Patrick: What do people say to that specific one? Roelof: Well, that's a little bit- Patrick: Too privileged? Roelof: Family secrets. Patrick: Family secrets. Roelof: No, but that's part of why we continue to innovate. And it gets back to the announcement of the Sequoia fund this week. I think it's so dangerous if you become fearful if you're successful, and you don't continue to innovate and push boundaries. Because you're guaranteed to not succeed in the future if you don't make changes. Because the world around us is changing. So we better adapt very quickly, and make smart moves, and not just rest on our laurels. Patrick: It's such a simple, obvious, when you say it out loud, closing thought. You will not be successful if you do not change. Roelof, this has been so much fun. I ask everyone that I talk to the same traditional closing question. What is the kindest thing that anyone's ever done for you? Roelof: The kindest thing is my wife forgiving me for my numerous mistakes. Patrick: Wonderful. I've learned a ton. I think what you've done is going to set the tone for where this business goes. And we'll be fascinated to see it evolve. Thank you so much for your time and all the insights today. Roelof: Thank you. It was nice to meet you.This site uses cookies to improve your browsing experience. By using this site, you are consenting to this policy.",2471
331,Sarah Friar - Building The Local Graph,Introduction," Patrick: My guest today is Sarah Friar, the CEO of Nextdoor, which connects people in local neighborhoods together. Sarah's CV sparkles with impressive achievements and interesting businesses. And we spent a lot of time in this conversation thinking through what excellence looks like as a CEO, CFO, equity analyst and board member. The rest of our discussion is focused on Nextdoor and how the soon to be public business is fostering connections between people and businesses in their local areas. I do this podcast so I get to meet and learn from people like Sarah. I could have talked to her for hours. I hope you enjoy this great conversation with Sarah Friar as much as I did.",148
332,Sarah Friar - Building The Local Graph,Excellence in Executive Roles," Patrick: So Sarah, I was trying to think of a fun way to begin our conversation that respects your very unique CV. You were an equity analyst at Goldman, so you have an investing background. You were a CFO, you're a board member at Walmart and Slack. You're the CEO of Nextdoor that's going public. You've got this wild smorgasbord of experience. And so I thought it'd be fun to open with asking what excellent means in each of those categories to you. And I'll start, maybe I'll go chronologically and I'll go all the way back to your equity analyst days. What do you think makes an excellent equity analyst? Sarah: I think the number one thing that makes a great equity analyst is fundamental research, where you actually do proprietary research and go talk to all of the stakeholders of a company. And I think too much gets done at a quite superficial level. And I think the best, both sell-side and buy-side, the best outcomes are where you're deep in the trenches talking to, ideally customers first, but I think it's great to talk to everyone surrounding a company, their community, their employees and so on. Because I think those are the moments where you have true insight and aha moments. Patrick: When you were at Goldman, what cemented that lesson? Was there a company or an episode that drilled that home for you? Sarah: So when I started on Goldman, my patch was security software, and this is 2000. The bubble is bursting all around us. Nobody wants to touch tech at all. And I actually started life as an investment banker, as the secret for that first year at Goldman. And there was nothing to do and I had been at McKinsey and so I was just curious and was like, ""Okay, well I'm going to go to a conference or two."" So I went to the RSA Security Conference and I came back and I wrote up this whole deck. And I remember my VP at Goldman was like, ""How did you find all this stuff out?"" And I'm like, ""Just went to this conference and talked to people."" And he was like, ""This is brilliant. We need to go out and talk to companies.""Long story short, I ended up transferring into research because we needed to end up covering those companies because they were the only companies that were investable to the positive in that period of a '01, '02, maybe '03, because Code Red, Nimda happened. You had all these viruses proliferating. Companies like Symantec and Network Associates who became McAfee... Oh my God, I am old, because I even remember the old name... were the only stocks doing well. And then actually from a IPO perspective, companies like NetScreen and so on came about. But it was just such a better lucky than good moment that I went to that RSA Conference. I spent all that time doing first-party research and it just really shocked me into, ""Oh my God, this is going to be huge."" I remember walking into the conference going, ""Oh my God. We are so screwed if we don't fix security in our technology stack. These companies are going to be massive and important in this period."" And that kind of cemented the beginning of my research career. Patrick: I've noticed recently, maybe it's just a weird selection bias, that I've talked to a lot of founders who had investing careers at some point. They were an analyst, they were banker, they were something in the sell-side or the buy-side. And I'm always really curious, for those that move from investing to operating, what lessons you port with you as really important? Like what do you think you've done differently as an operator because of the time that you spent as an investor? Sarah: Number one is that curiosity. And so today what I tell everyone who works with me is, get out of the building today. It's your home, but it used to be your office, and actually go talk to customers. It's in that moment where you may talk to hundreds of them over a course of time. So you'll either pick up a theme that's building or there'll be that insight moment. So when I was at Square, I remember we had this dinner for a whole bunch of SMBs. And we've had this offsite and we had this great idea to bring a bunch of customers in. And I sat next to this guy who ran a series of hair salons, actually. And I kept asking him, ""What about like CRM systems? And one year payments?"" I kept asking, asking, asking. And then towards the end, we started to talk about Square, well it became Square Capital, but this idea of lending. ""What was really tough in your business?"" He's like, ""Getting access to working capital."" And I was like, ""Oh, what if we did something like this?"" Which became the genesis for Square Capital.And that was the point where he handed me his business card. He said, ""If you do that, call me."" Everything else was me pulling teeth. I was really excited, but he was not super excited. There are moments in your life where I feel like you almost see the light bulb go off. And so I think it's the same theme of, don't get stuck in your ivory tower. Don't kind of end up in your echo chamber with all the people who agree with you. Get out and be curious. And I think the second part of it is actually, I'm a big believer in range. If you've read the book, you learn things in one area that actually you start to pattern recognize in a second area. I think research and banking and investing are very good at that, because you actually have to be very broad all the time and look for trends. When you go inside a company, you can become very narrow, very fast, because you're literally working on this. What, it's like you work on one stock only. And so pushing yourself to stay broad and to stay curious and to not get too caught up in like, ""Well I don't want to go meet with that person because they don't do exactly what I'm doing right now."" Or, ""I don't want to go to experience that conference or whatever, because it's not exactly what I'm working on."" I actually always push myself to go to the things that seem most tangential to what I'm doing. Because in those moments, I find I have bigger, better ideas. Patrick: It's interesting that at Square you were the CFO, but the first story we've heard is one of customer discovery or insight. Same question on the CFO role, what do you think makes for an excellent CFO given your experience there? Sarah: I think it's exactly that. Typically, when people come to me to ask for advice on hiring a CFO, I usually talk like there's two paths. There's a more traditional path, as someone who came up through the more accounting side of the house and they're great, you absolutely need that discipline. But I think people who have come with other life experiences, who've maybe run a product, started a company, they just bring that incremental empathy to bear, of understanding what it's like for the product team as they're trying to build. What it's like for the sales team, as they're trying to go to market. What it's like for your marketing team, if you're doing kind of scalable data-driven marketing. I think you actually make better decisions alongside the whole team than if you really only come with this one lens around, everything has to have a dollar sign in front of it for you to be interested. Patrick: How much of the capital allocation story of the business was under your purview at Square? And how did you think about the role of the CFO in capital allocation, which seems to become a more important function as the company gets bigger and is more successful? Sarah: For sure, it's in your purview. But if it's just coming down to you, there's something missing. Because in the end, there's a big thing to be said about the wisdom of the crowd. So making sure that you're getting everyone's input. At Square, we used to always say, great ideas can come from everywhere. Try not to be hierarchical or domain driven when you're thinking about something like capital allocation. I think in the CFO role, can see the model building up. There's kind of quote unquote, the maintenance level. What are you entering a year with? Which people are on when you cost it all out, it's kind of your run rate of capital allocation. I don't totally subscribe to zero-based budgeting. I remember when that was a thing back in the day, but I do think that every year you should re-look and truly test, do you need that? I call that core and then there's strategic investing. So what are things that are starting to get product market fed? Or it's kind of so obvious based on your competitive advantages that of course you should go invest in those. And they should have a timeline where you can put a P&L to them and you can see revenue that's coming within one to three, maybe five year, but really one to three year timeline.Revenue ahead, but profits might come a little bit more, and it has to get to scale. But then I think as a good CFO, you have to cut out a portion of your P&L that's truly for experimentation. At Nextdoor, we call it venture bets, where you're ring fencing an amount and you have to get comfortable, like what's the right amount? You might do it as a percent of total cost. You might do it as a percent of people. Today, we kind of talk about a 20-person team to get going on a true venture be. And I think the worst thing as a CFO that you do is you try to put a P&L on it. Because no one yet knows what the right way to monetize the idea is. And you can actually break it by getting the product team so fixated on, this is how the business model works, that they craft the whole product to that business model. When in actual fact, a different business model might be the true unlock as to why the product works.",2261
333,Sarah Friar - Building The Local Graph,Ikigai Career Framework," Patrick: I'll come back to CEO and board member excellence, but just to take a little sidebar really quick, because I think it's so interesting that you worked after leaving Goldman for Benioff and for Jack Dorsey, two really well-known, iconic CEOs. And I'm always interested in, what successfully sells someone of your talent to come join somewhere else? And so I'm curious if you think back to those two episodes, what was it that convinced you to join Salesforce and Square? And I'm looking for kind of generalizable lessons here for recruiting very high-end talent successfully. Sarah: I mean, today I've kind of learned a framework that I use with a lot of people. It's called Ikigai, I-K-I-G-A-I. It's a Japanese framework. I wish I'd been able to articulate this back in the day. But it's four overlapping circles, which is what you're good at, what you're passionate about or what you love, what the world needs and then what you can get paid for, right. Without the fourth it's just a hobby. And I think if you can get people to really construct what it is that they do, but are they passionate about it, right? That's often the bit that's missing. I was a good research analyst, but I was not passionate about picking stocks in my life. I was super passionate actually about my team and the people and tech trends, but I wasn't super passionate about the day-to-day kind of stock junky piece. Was it what the world needs? I don't know. That really, in the end, was what got me a little. I wasn't sure it was what I felt the world needed. No offense to your entire listener base right now. I could certainly get paid for it. It was very good pay. Patrick: Yep. Sarah: And when I went to work with Marc at Salesforce, he found a role where I was very good at it. I certainly got a lot more passionate because it was much more... When you're inside of companies, so much of it is about people. To get your people right, everything else just works. So I kind of started to recognize that that was a real passion of mine. Again with Salesforce automation, what the world needed, not totally sure. I do think there was a lot. Marc is excellent at turning it into a movement. There's a reason why he loves Star Wars. He made you feel like you were on the side of the good guys with the lightsaber, because you were going to the cloud, could still get paid there. By the time I got to Jack, the circles were starting to get much tighter for me.And I was good at it because I was getting into an area where my data analytics skills could come to the fore, where I was passionate about space. I actually do really like FinTech. I was passionate about the people side and the growing a company, was super passionate about what we could do for small businesses. And Jack, like Marc, is phenomenal at this idea of raising a purpose statement. At Square it was economic empowerment. I certainly felt that was something the world needed. And again, you could have a really good financial outcome. Stops being such a big driver for me, probably at this period of my life. But it's easier to say that when you're in a place of privilege. And then when I got to Nextdoor, the circles now feel really tight. They really, really work for me. Patrick: I love that initial episode of moving from Square to Nextdoor. And if you're right at the center of that bullseye, which is incredibly well articulated, definitely going to steal that concept. Describe what that felt like? What did approaching that business for the first time feel like? What ignited your pattern recognition from your equity days that this could be a really good business to satisfy that make a lot of money condition? Walk me through the initial appeal of joining Nextdoor. Sarah: If you go back to the circles, I really started to understand this passion in life about people. And then it was extending out into community. Big arc in my life, starting back in Northern Ireland, my mom and dad, totally what we'd call community activists today, just didn't have a fancy name for it, to this idea of community. And I truly believe, in terms of what the world needs, I think this is on the same par with stopping climate change or fixing our issues with climate change. The degradation that's happening in our society and in community, I actually think one of the offshoots are things like our lack of care for the world. In terms of the circles, it really fits the passion, what I could be good at. But you asked me with a research analyst hat on. I also love the trends. You could see that people were edging back towards local. Now, when I joined at the beginning of 2019, I was still felt like I was evangelizing that. I think what COVID has done is, I no longer feel like I need to evangelize this power of proximity. So that's kind of number one. Number two is, it's hard to aggregate people onto a platform. Most of the graphs are taken. The friends and family graph, Facebook has kind of owned.The professional graph, LinkedIn has owned, but no one owned this local graph. And that's one of the most powerful things in building a network, is that you own a graph. And Nextdoor has firmly stuck their stake there. Nextdoor equaled neighborhood. Very powerful business models can get thrown off of owning a network effect business. So what could they be? So then I looked at that and said, ""Okay, wow, what I see in this company, it sits on top of a mountain of data, proprietary data, very akin to Square."" When I looked at Square, what I saw was a huge data lake. What most people saw was a little point of sale system. And I'm like, ""No, when you have that data, your ability to build a really powerful business model on top is massive."" So with Nextdoor, what I see is the ability to take our proprietary first-party data and then to really make it hum, for neighbors to find what they're looking for on Nextdoor. It might be a large brand, like maybe it's a McDonald's or a Chipotle or a Walmart. But it can also be that really small business, the local plumber, all the way down to the dog walker or the babysitter. And no one has been able to connect at a local level, that huge opportunity. So that's what I get excited about from a research analyst perspective.",1461
334,Sarah Friar - Building The Local Graph,Building the Local Graph," Patrick: I don't think he'd mind my sharing this little story, which was, I was sitting... I think it was soon after you joined... with Bill Gurley and it was the first I had heard of Nextdoor. And I remember him showing me the app on the phone, just like, ""Can you believe the amount of different things that we could do with this graph?"" Basically, like exactly what you just said and it was this almost like giddy excitement for the different kinds of business models that are different that are unlocked because of this information, which I just think is so cool. And it harkens back to the point you made that I want to dig in a bit on, which is this notion of community. Maybe it's time to go to your personal story. I'm curious what you learned from your parents about community and to dig into that degradation word that you use. Like, what is it that was breaking or is broken or is still breaking about community and how might we start to fix that? Sarah: Yeah. So I'm going to start by sounding a little pessimistic, which for those who know me, is not me. I'm the eternal optimist, which by the way, I think is another point of excellence for a CEO, for anyone. But eternal optimism, if you go back and look into literature, you'll see starting in kind of the 1950s, particularly in the United States, but it's true globally, you start to see this downtick in people joining community-driven type organizations. Bob Putnam of Harvard is the guy who's written most on this, or at least written in a way that most interests me, when he wrote this book called Bowling Alone. He doesn't actively say, blame television, but he does talk about this beginning of the technology revolution, which often people think about it as more the 1990s, beginning of computer processor, but really, it takes it back to TV.So we went from a nation of joiners, which is what the telco called us, to a nation that moved off of their front stoop, where they really knew their community and into the living room and started to engage in what is actually much more of an individualistic form of entertainment. From there, computing happened. We started to build networks and connections, the phone, social media as it stands today. We often stay in a world that's never been more connected yet people have never felt more alone. That's a huge trend, first of all, from a technology standpoint. The second trend you see is just even how communities are designed. We build roads that cut through communities. There were a lot of bad things that happened to segregate communities. Again, that caused a lot of downfall. People moved from rural and more suburban areas into major cities and blossom of that community fabric. Then the third thing is this cultural shift that's happened around our values. You've seen institutions like the church or institutions like say, the Boy Scouts, the Girl Guides, and so on. There's very little trust. There's very little trust in government.The religion has fallen away. So this cultural shift, all of these negative trends, if you were an analyst writing a research report, you would not be a buyer on this stock. I'm not going to turn it around. What I get excited about is I actually think that we as humans just have this need to connect with one another. It's just an internal mechanism for us that we recognize this power of human to human connection. We've also done a lot of research at Nextdoor that shows it's just good for your health. Frankly, even if you're living in a more selfish world, knowing six or more neighbors has a dramatic impact on feelings of loneliness and social isolation, which have both bad psychological and physiological impacts. So fast forward, disasters are one place where Nextdoor tends to really shine. We've seen it in microcosms like the hurricane Harvey, but now we're seeing it in this macrocosm of COVID-19, where people have recognized this power of local. I think it's a structural change that we're not going back, that people are recognizing this need for community. You see it in all of these other macro trends that many of your folks are investing behind, whether it's shopping local, eating local, wanting to know the etymology of the produce that you're eating, people coming together from a societal standpoint to help each other. These are all now big trends that I think we have really latched onto. I want to drive frankly. Patrick: What have you learned about the physical component of community and interaction? Because it seems like we are entering a nice golden age of online community. Maybe this also is COVID-driven, but it just seems like it is the buzzword in the technology investing world, community building, infrastructure building, companies have become very popular, but in person, it's not talked about probably enough and obviously it's something that you have in your arsenal. What have you learned there? Like if you're sitting on top of a pile of data, what are some interesting data points about in-person interaction, neighborly community that you find compelling? Sarah: We have done research. Julianne Holt-Lunstad is a research out of Brigham Young. She's the world expert and loneliness. Her research showed two things. Number one is just small acts of kindness, but in real life, have a really significant impact overall on our feelings of well-being. Then the second piece about knowing six neighbors, that's all it takes. You think about all the advice you get around your life, run five miles, or eat your colors, no six neighbors is the equivalent of doing those other things as well. I think the second thing we've seen in our research is about resiliency of communities. We had a researcher go very deep on communities pre, during, and post hurricane Harvey. What they saw is that communities where people had stronger connections, frankly, where there was more proliferation of Nextdoor, I'm going to sell my own book right now, but those communities, first of all, during a time of tragedy or a disaster responded much better. The neighborhoods helped each other, so fewer people died, and then they covered much more quickly.So communities tended to rally around each other to help their communities recover. So the community stuck around and thrived versus communities where there was very low social ties. People would just move away. They would give up. They're like, ""I'm not going to rebuild this home"" or ""I want to live somewhere where we don't have fires,"" and so communities would disperse and break apart. We know that there's a very active link for real in-person connections. I get that we might be moving to the metaverse, but I think we cannot do away with real, live, in-person connections. Patrick: It seems like for this business, when you came to join it, network density, which is a topic that network effect businesses talk about a lot or analysts talk about a lot, is absolutely critical. If I show up on Nextdoor and none of my neighbors or no one in Greenwich, Connecticut where I live is on there, it's immediately useless to me. When you showed up, what did that look and feel like? What was the network density and is that the driving variable that you think about for product quality in Nextdoor because of how important it is that I'm able to connect with my local community? Sarah: Yeah. Network density is clearly important for network-driven businesses. Network-driven businesses are amazing when you can find them. All the research has shown that. When I showed up at Nextdoor, if you look at density, in the US, we were probably about one in six households on the platform, maybe one in seven. Today, we're one in three and so for sure, once you start getting to one in three households on the platform, the good news is that first of all, we blanket this country. We're in 11 countries. I'll talk about the more nascent countries, but in the US, when you show up, there will be an extra neighborhood that exists. The likelihood that it's a very vibrant community gets higher and higher as time goes by. So what we see for sure is that neighborhoods will say we have 5% to 10% penetration. Start with, okay, weekly active engagement. But as you get up into our first quartile, the weekly active engagement more than two access. That's because if you think about people come for utility or they come for community, if you come with a utilitarian question, ""Hey neighbors, what's the best ISP to use.I just moved in"" or ""Hey neighbors, I need an emergency plumber,"" the likelihood you get an immediate and good answer gets higher and higher as more people join the network. Then from a community perspective, the chances that you connect to neighbors that are like you, the chances that you start to create friend groups or stronger bonds gets higher the more people in a community that are on the platform. So yes, when you ask the question, we build for active, valued communities, those three words. So we don't want people to be passive. We are actually going to push you to be active in your community. There will, of course, always be some lurkers and so on, but we're going to push you to have a reaction, have a comment, reply to that neighbor in need. Then we want to tip you over into willing to be that postered, start to get things going. We want you to feel like the community is valuable. I think COVID again helped here because for sure, we belong to other communities. Facebook wasn't helping me when I needed toilet paper. Facebook wasn't particularly helpful. Reddit wasn't particularly helpful if I needed someone to go to the pharmacy for me. Nextdoor is a valued community, and then of course this word community, which is really strong word about social connections being made. Patrick: If we come back to the local graph being the key driving engine of what makes Nextdoor the business interesting, what have you learned about leaning in on that relative to other competitive social networks? Maybe the most obvious one would be, I think there's like a Greenwich dads Facebook group or something that solves probably some of the same things, but certainly not others. How do you drive the appropriate wedge as a business between what you can do because of how your platform's built versus a general purpose platform like Facebook? Sarah: I think you have to stay very true to what's our core competitive advantage. Number one is trust. Nextdoor was founded on trust. We verify that you live in the neighborhood. It probably slowed us down to do that, but we don't want growth at any cost. We expect you to show up as a real neighbor with a real name at a real address. Again, very different from say a platform like Twitter or Instagram, where they actively in the product push you to have a handle. In Twitter, I'm @thefriley. That was my nickname at business school when I thought this Twitter thing will never take off. Don't tell Jack I said that. So I didn't feel compelled to have my real name. Second thing is local perspectives and utility. We are about accessing the social capital of your neighborhood. We drive people in the product to know that it's a place where you can ask a neighbor for advice and we really norm that behavior and then we amplify that behavior.Then this third piece about proximity and in real life connection. Again, we're very uniquely positioned because yes, you could create a dads group on another platform, but you can't guarantee that you could all get together to go for a beer or you could all get together. I literally just went to a dad's group in Virginia back to meeting your customers to see how they interacted. They all were able to drive to Panera Bread where we had dinner together. This is a group that's been together now for three years. So where to join a cooking group? In Nextdoor, you actually probably could go meet in someone's kitchen and do the recipe together. We have to lean into the fact that our differentiator is proximity. So trust, local perspective, and proximity. Patrick: Pardon the nerdy specific product question, but I just love this stuff. How do you think about platform leakage? Because you are local, it'd be an amazing way to maybe meet people locally and get to know them originally, but could start a WhatsApp group or something with that group that went to Panera Bread and probably coordinate pretty well and not need to use and constantly go back to Nextdoor. So how do you think about that challenge of you're so good at something local, but then the function could cease to be useful on the platform and could leak somewhere else? Sarah: Brings me to this idea of compliments and true competitors. I think on the compliments, often it's worth seeing why someone might form a WhatsApp group or in the case of the father's group or the dad's group, he was using a different tech tool to just deal with the logistics. To me, that's either a product opportunity where we're doing the logistics for him or it's an API opportunity. Not to get all techy, but this is where the platform should come into its own. We're not going to build absolutely everything. I almost think of this like a chess board where you're going to fill in single square over time, but in the short run, you have to pick the squares where you have unique, competitive advantage, and then in the other squares, you should absolutely go partner. The more you do that through API, it's the more scalable and it's faster.That's on the compliment side, one thing I'm always looking for and hearing for. Then on the competitive side, which is where you're going, where true leakage has happened, you need to really understand the why. But again, I come back to, I don't want to sound Pollyannish, but Nextdoor is incredibly unique because no one owns the local graph. No one has gotten to our scale of 11 countries. I said I would come back to that, but if you look at the UK. We blanket the UK. Canada is our youngest country. It's only two years old and yet already, we see credible blanketing of the major cities of Canada, which is really how Nextdoor often starts. I don't worry as much about a true competitive threat because I don't think anyone owns local or is doing the breadth of local that we are doing. Patrick: How do you launch a new country? Maybe Canada's the right example where network density matters. I always think about Uber. Uber story was always so interesting here that have this notorious city heads that would go by hook and crook, just build the network on both sides of the marketplace. What is the strategy that you've learned for successfully getting a good wedge into, let's say, Canada? Sarah: So this is what makes it hard to do. Again, coming back to what I saw as a research analyst on Nextdoor. I don't know if I would've had the courage on day one to build this company, because it is hard, but once you get to a certain tipping point of scale, I think it's an incredible moat. When we go to a new country like Canada, it's really about first and foremost, thinking about the map of the country. Metropolitan areas are always easier because they have density of people to start with. Then very quickly, you want to break it down into neighborhoods. Remember what is incredible about Nextdoor is we're not talking about metros or DMAs, often a term used in advertising. We are actually talking about neighborhoods that are anywhere from maybe 800 to 1,000 households, quite small. Once we map that, then we can overlay using a lot of census type data, demographic data. What are the neighborhoods where we know Nextdoor will typically really take off? For example, we do really well with millennial parents. 30% of people who come to Nextdoor say they come to meet local parents with same age children.It probably doesn't shock you. It's really good to overlay where do you have a demographic of younger parents, for example. Then we go into those neighborhoods and this where it becomes a little bit more qual and not exactly quant anymore, because you're just trying to light the initial spark or fire. So you're trying to find the people who are natural community activists, today, we call them our neighborhood team, and those people we want to ignite to show them here's the power of what this platform can do for you. It will be a way for you to aggregate people when you want to do things in your community, but first, you have to help us get the people on. We will do neighbor to neighbor invitations. We often will do our own pushes Nextdoor. We layer on top of that. When we launched Toronto, we brought the mayor in meritory. We brought in the Red Cross to talk about how a big platform like the Red Cross would use us a lot in the United States could use us in Canada. We brought in some Canadian specific small businesses or brand names that people would recognize. So that lights the PR media push.Then often, we'll go to public agencies. We've found throughout our time that working with the local mayor or working with FEMA in the United States or working with UK government, these are institutions that almost immediately see the power of it. They've almost often been trying to build it themselves, which makes no sense because they're not technology companies. So they see the benefit of getting more people onto Nextdoor because then we act as this amazing channel for them either in an emergency like FEMA or US census when they wanted to count people or UK gov right now when they're trying to put out messaging about staying safe during COVID. So it's a whole melting pot of all of those constituents coming together. Then as you see neighborhoods heat up, then of course, the two bigger unlocks for us right now are first of all, we're getting much better at letting content travel to anyone who could be interested in it. We used to keep content only within the neighborhood, and now, we've said that doesn't make sense. When the California wildfires happened this summer and they evacuated Lake Tahoe, yes, the Lake Tahoe neighborhoods were extremely energized because they were saving themselves on Nextdoor, but the Nextdoor neighborhoods wanted to know if they were safe all the way down to the bay area and then even beyond where people wanted to know what could they do to help.So now we let content travel. Then the final thing we're unlocking is this idea of you actually being able to follow more than one neighborhood. So a big insight. I kept hearing it when I joined, was people who honestly felt had first world problems of two houses and they wanted to be in two Nextdoor neighborhoods. But I will admit it's being a little dismissive. As I went through COVID and saw people wanting to follow their parents' neighborhood or their kids' neighborhood or the neighborhood where their business was shattered, I finally said, ""Okay, let's back off. This is a true need. People care about more than one neighborhood, so let's let them belong."" So of course that actually amplifies and actually accelerates newer countries because people are now showing up in more than one neighborhood, which is a good way to create more liquidity on the platform. Patrick: Does this all manifest in a curated feed for each individual user? Is the feed the home base of the product in your mind? Sarah: It is although, the caveat I would say is that one of the things we're very mindful of is not creating a true echo chamber. I have many beefs with other companies, but let's say other companies in the social media space, I feel like they have often led with a growth first mentality. We definitely view that as not the right way to create great communities. One of the manifestations of growth in any cost is that people love to hear from people like themselves. It just becomes like an echo chamber that feeds on itself and suddenly, you think you're right about everything you fundamentally believe. What we Nextdoor love about neighborhoods are neighborhoods are inherently diverse, different socio and economic groups, people who've moved from all different parts of the world, different age groups, you name it. There's all these different things that make our neighborhoods so beautiful.So we want to keep some of that serendipity. As a base example, I always say, I'm not a huge pet lover. I grew up in a farming community. Dogs worked. They didn't lie on your sofa, but if someone loses a dog around me, I want to know about that because I'm very community driven and I would of course look out for your dog and hope I could save them if it came to it. It's an example where you'll never see me super interact with pets in my feed, yet in the moment, you want me there. So we don't want to be such an echo chamber if that makes sense. Patrick: You've mentioned quality growth a number of times, so I'm curious the other side of the coin. What have been the biggest mistakes that you've seen the business make when it comes to growth and what are the lessons that you take from them? Sarah: When I joined Nextdoor's strategy was to be the private social network for your neighborhood. What I saw in there, mistake is a strong word, I think we're all just iterating and learning, but number one, private was important because it was part of trust. But I think we got so focused on singularity of neighborhood that we didn't allow for the fact that people have this broader purview. They care about more than one neighborhood. I think the second piece is social network as opposed to community platform. Nextdoor has found its zone in being this community platform. Kindness is at our core. I know it's one of your favorite questions, but our ladder up purpose is to cultivate a kinder world where everyone has a neighborhood to rely on. I think we got rid of that social media moniker for your neighborhood, the singularity of just one neighborhood. Today, we are the place you connect to the neighborhoods that matter to you, so you can belong. You can hear in that, first of all, a much more expansive view of the neighborhoods. We invited in a lot more people, including the local businesses, the local public agencies, local nonprofits. It's not just about residents. We opened it up to multiple neighborhoods, but we also injected this emotional piece. I think one of the mistakes product people often make is they're very good about what the utility of the product is, but they forget that we as humans have to have a real emotional connection to great products and services. And so, injecting belonging was a really big part of shifting how the product development was happening.",4927
335,Sarah Friar - Building The Local Graph,Business Model Options for Nextdoor," Patrick: So much of it sounds like a public good, that you become digital infrastructure for better local communities. But going back to your Ikigai and the fourth economic opportunity to really hit the bullseye, I'd love to understand the business model a little bit. And I love to question you, when and why does the cash register ring at Nextdoor? And most social networks obviously historically have been advertising driven models. We're seeing some paid versions of that emerge. But, how do you think about the options for business model in that same spirit of iteration versus mistakes, moving towards a model that's most aligned with the advertisers, with the local community members, et cetera? Sarah: As I said in the beginning, when I looked at Nextdoor, I saw a lot of what we just talked about, this beauty of community. But I also saw a company sitting on, to me, this data lake of amazing proprietary first-party data. When someone joins the platform, they tell you where they live, so you don't have to go guess it by dropping cookies and following them around the web. We actually just know. So, today our business model, so when the cash register rings, it's really all to do with advertising today. And the digital ad market is huge. It's about 143 billion in 2020. It supposed to go to 262 billion by 2024. Every advertiser I speak to is taking spend away from old-world advertising, like t print and moving to digital. So, the good news is we are in a big pond chasing a big market. I never loved stocks that were the big fish in the small pond, because at some point you're always run out of town. For us, when we go after advertisers, we do break it down into enterprise, mid-market and then small. And, if you think about what we do for each, first of all, for large advertisers, what they get is a very unique platform. So, today what we see is when about a quarter of next-door neighbors don't actually use any other social media platforms, believe it or not, those who are using other social media, about 82% don't go to Snap. That's probably not so shocking. 56% don't go to Pinterest, and 16% don't go to Facebook or Facebook Messenger. So, what we're telling a brand is, if you have a brand message to carry, we're going to get you to a unique audience. That's number one. Number two, what we can tell a brand is, we are going to get you in as very community driven.So if you want to tailor your message to being seen as much more generous, you're not just trying to sell stuff, but you actually want to help this person or this community, that's a place where Nextdoor really thrives, as well. So Walmart has worked with us on things like help maps. H&R Block is a great example of a brand that has done a whole campaign about ""Make Every Block Better."" And so we go out and we ask for inbounds from all of our neighbors, for great things that have happened in communities that they want funded. And then H&R Block picks, I think, it's their top 10 or their top 20, and they give them $10,000 to go out and build the baseball diamond, or build the community garden. The third thing, though, because we have all that data is, we are really good for direct response as well. So, often people talk about top-of-the-funnel brand awareness, direct response. A lot of platforms struggle with being both. The great ones have done it well. The ones that are still trying to figure it out have never gotten to direct response. We do really well in direct response, because people are coming with really high intent to begin with. So, they're often coming with a question, where an ad becomes content, not just an ad. If I'm coming because I desperately need someone to unclog my drains, and I see an ad for the local rotor router or whatever, that's like, ""Yay! How do I call you right now?"" And we've made it better and better to do a call to action, click to call, click to schedule. So we make that direct response better and better.And, of course, anything that involves a call to action that is in real life. So, ""Come visit the new Albertsons store. That really performs on Nextdoor. You started to allude to other business models. This is definitely where I get excited over the long run, because you could imagine business models around small businesses, where we are their ad platform, but maybe we're their CRM system ... I'm somewhat tied up with CRM systems in my life. That's twice I've mentioned them now. But there's all sorts of interesting things you could do there. We have a platform called ""Fines,"" where people put stuff they want to get rid of from their home, for sale or free. We don't take any transaction on that today. Could we do that? For sure. You could imagine events. There's all of these other ways that I think we can monetize local. But, as my wonderful CFO always reminds me, don't lose sight of that ad market where you started, because it's so big and we're just getting going. Patrick: Obviously, there's been some of the best businesses in the world built in this market, Facebook and Google, most specifically. I remember talking to an early Snap investor and just talking about how hard it is until you reach scale in the advertising business. That it's just a slog. And then when you do reach, it's a peerless business. Again, those are probably the two most amazing business models on the planet in Facebook and Google. So, talk to me a bit about the importance of scale in advertising. If that observation is true, what have you learned about scale and advertising? Are you there? If not, how do you get there? Sarah: So, I would completely concur. It's literally when you get to scale, it's like the clouds part when you're flying in your plane. You're like “ahhhh” , there's sky everywhere. And so what I've learned in that is, for sure, I would say Nextdoor has been in a slog motion for the last couple of years, because we're getting to scale. Broad-based, we can get to a lot of people, one in three households. But, the minute you want to do really granular-level targeting ... Three years ago, two years ago, one year ago, the bucket that you could go after would end up getting a bit small. Today, I would say in the US we're cracking through. Now, what we had to do, though, in that three-year period is, you had to really come up a with innovative things that people couldn't do elsewhere. We used to call it ""Never-been-done-before type of outcomes."" So it's led us to invest in places like our map surface. So again, anything to do with place works on Nextdoor. It's a core tenant of how we build product. And so, if you think about a map, map is all about place.Maps are something we can uniquely do. So we've had repeatable formats, like we do a Treat Map every year. This year it's sponsored by Hershey's. Last year was sponsored by Party City. We do a Cheer Map around the holidays. In disaster times we'll do a Help Map. And what we're realizing is, that got us through the early days of figuring out there's a ""there"" there, figuring out it's very unique and different and it helps tell our story. It also has really high engagement for neighbors, because again, they think of it as content, not an ad. But, what we're learning is okay, now we need to make this whole map surface much more, just dynamic, extensible. Why do we make it that Hershey sponsors our Treat Map? Why wouldn't we let ... Any advertiser, in any jurisdiction, in an auction model can own that area. Why wouldn't we let them just win? There's a learning of going from, I would say, more static, never being done before, to more dynamic, to ultimately truly unique elements of your ad platform, that no one else can copy you in. Patrick: Maybe now's the time to ask about CEO excellence? So I'm really curious in facing this kind of opportunity set, where you're getting to scale, but you also have all this surface area in the product. What have you learned in your tenure so far at Nextdoor about effectively steering the company's strategy? There's so many different things you could do. You can actually only execute on a subset of those things. How do you do that? What is your personal OS for running that part of the company? Sarah: One of my really dear friends, Roelof over at Sequoia Capital ... When I was first moving to Nextdoor and I was picking his brain on lots of things, he said, this phrase always stuck with me. He's like, ""Oh, you're a feast-not-famine business."" And I was like, ""What do you mean?"" He's like, ""Oh, you're going to die from overeating. You're not going to die from lack of food."" And where he was going was there is so much we can do that prioritization is everything. And that, I think, for me as the CEO ... I don't always actually love titles ... But as a major contributor to our strategy over time, one of my main things is to force prioritization. And, you'll recall at the very beginning of this conversation, I talked about range. How I'm eternally curious. These are two traits that often can be in conflict with one another. I also need to surround myself with people who are really good at pulling me back. Sometimes when I'm ranging out there, starting to partake of the feast, to say, ""Nope, we're literally going to reprioritize."" We just did this with our product roadmap in the middle of the year.We have a relatively new product leader that came in from LinkedIn. And so, sitting down with Karen and literally saying, ""Okay, here's everything we're working on and now we're going to stack rank. One, if we're going to do one thing, it's one. If we're going to do two things, it's one, two. And then we're going to put our resources against these until we're full, until we literally don't have anyone left and prod to have."" And it's not quite as fungible as I'm making it sound, because usually build and pod. So you have an engineer, a designer, data scientist, product person. So it's more pod-like. But, we're literally going to fill the bucket until we reach our level, and then we stop. And everything else we're going to put into maintenance mode, maybe, but we also may just kill. And that process for companies is one of the hardest. And, I think, companies just by nature, you do that and you feel ... It's like a New Year's resolution. You're like, ""This is great. I'm running. I don't drink anymore and I'm eating healthily."" And then, the year goes on and you just keep adding some stuff back. And so, I almost feel like every six months you need to take a very hard look at what you're doing and why you're doing it.And then, being quite callous on the things that maybe are working, but aren't working to the extent that they need to work. And that's the other thing at scale ... Actually something you mentioned, Walmart. It's something that is both the blessing and curse of Walmart is that, it takes a lot for it to matter, when you do half a trillion dollars of revenue. It turns out, when someone shows up and they're like, ""I think I can do $10 million of revenue."" You're like, ""It doesn't matter."" Patrick: Oh, dear. Sarah: And the same got true at Square. As we got bigger, people will get real excited with new product ideas. Like, ""This can do 100 million!"" I'm like, ""Yeah, I actually don't care. Don't care. Come back if you think it's bigger. But if it's not bigger, let's kill it, and let's move those people to another place where they can do something more at scale."" And so, learning to do that over and over again now at Nextdoor ... It's great, because it keeps me on my toes. And it's painful, because sometimes you really have to drop things that are painful to drop. Patrick: There's something very interesting about the pruning concept, and also this competitive idea that if 100 million is not worth it to you at Square, for some young start up it is. It's a fascinating tension of, yeah, you have to move the needle, but make sure that something doesn't come at you convexly that really disrupts you quickly. Sarah: That's exactly right. Yeah. Patrick: Why don't you like titles? Sarah: Because I think they get people into a mindset of what they imagine they should be doing, not what they could be doing. In growing companies what I've learned is, when you give people a title ... Salesforce is a very title-dominant environment, because title is part of reward. When you hire a VP of Eng. And then, if companies are doing what they should do, they outgrow people, quite quickly. And so what do you do now? Do you hire an SVP of Engineering? And then your VP of Engineering's now totally pissed and probably leaves. And then, your SVP lasts for a period of time. And now, what are you going to do? You hire an EVP. And then you hire a Chief Architect. So you're just making up titles versus ...I prefer people's titles to surround their work. So, you say you are the Head of Neighbor Value, all right, would be a starting point for Nextdoor. And then, over time as we've gotten bigger, we can see that we're big enough to now have neighbor value focused on engagement, and neighbor value focused on growth. How do you bring more neighbors in? How do you engage the neighbors you have? So, now you cell divide the title, where no one feels like they got screwed in that move, because they're still now managing something that's still growing and is still even bigger than where they started, versus ... Titles just put you in cement. Patrick: As you think about the key strategic priorities back to pruning and focus for Nextdoor, in its next chapter as a business, how would you articulate those? What are the couple of things that you think will most drive the right outcomes as you steer it forward from here? Obviously, you're going public soon, a new chapter in the business's history. Sarah: Three areas that we are focused on. Near term, it's about driving engagement. So the neighbors we have, we know that when they go from ""M.A.W."", From monthlys to weeklys, their propensity to go to daily is incredibly high. So, once you've experienced Nextdoor on a weekly basis, we're going to turn you into a daily. So, our focus is in that ""M.A.W-to-wow!"" Motion. And so, a lot of our product development is on things like notifications. We're a platform that brings people back, but how do we do that much more fine grained and really smartly? So that's where investments, ML and data science really help. Connections is another area that we've talked about, where when Nextdoor started, we had this idea that you didn't know your neighbors. The Pew Institute survey that began it all, said 28% of Americans knew one neighbor, and 29% ... Don't totally called me in these numbers. 29% didn't know any neighbors. And so we never thought that there's this need for connection. Now that we're in one and three households, it's actually important to let people know that people they know live around them. It can be a moment of, ""Oh, wow, I didn't know that!"" I just talked to someone last week who I worked with way back at McKinsey in South Africa. And turns out he lives in the next town. So I would really love to have known that we're neighbors.Connections is a big investment, because the other thing we know that people you know, talking about things you care about, is the number one engagement driver. But people you know, talking about things you don't care about is number two. Humans care more about the human and the connection than they actually do about the topic. So, it behooves us to do better on connections. So that's one big area. Second is SMB. We feel like we're really uniquely positioned to win with small, mid-sized businesses, because so many of them are inherently local. The pizza place, the hair salon, these are things that only happen physically close. You can't Amazon Prime them or whatever. So, SMB growth. And then, I think, the third area continues to be on the ad platform, because ultimately as you talked about, that rings the cash register. So it brings money back into the business and makes sure that we can keep investing for growth. Patrick: How do advertisers evaluate platforms like yours? It strikes me that Facebook's product for advertisers is elite. It's just incredibly good. And that a lot of the way an advertiser might evaluate things is return on investment. ""What am I getting for dollar spent on Facebook? What are the KPIs or something? And if I'm shopping my dollars to be spent across different ad platforms, and diversifying it, or trying to accomplish different things ... "" How do they think? How does an advertiser approach a Nextdoor and evaluate you? Sarah: Advertisers are very metric driven. And we have gotten better at better at needing them where they're at, either through third-party measurement, which everyone likes when you're not grading your own homework, which would definitely be a critique, I would say, of some of the bigger platforms. But also even our first-party measurement. So being able to drop a pixel on a Nextdoor ad. So, now we can be much more sophisticated about attribution. A little anecdote story, but I was talking to the CEO of someone who advertises on us, a home services world. And we were really trying to press on them that we think they're under attributing Nextdoor's share awesomeness. I can't think of the right phrase for it. And the work we had done, it's in my brain now, is that we saw that people who are 45 and above tend to click on ads. So the good new is they're So easy to attribute that demographic. But, people who are 45 and below, who grew up much more internet natives, they see something and then they've been taught to go Google search. So it goes into their brain, and then when they want to go back to it, they go do a Google search. And so, if you can drop a pixel, so, you know they've seen an ad, but then attribute over the next 24 or even 48 hours, did they subsequently do a Google search, you actually get a much better idea of the efficacy of the ad. And, because we could see it so distinct when we cut it by age, that's what really makes me believe it, that we're not just trying to tell you, ""Honestly, don't worry, these ads are performing.""I thought the next layer down of analysis was so smart and so interesting. It goes back to advertisers really want us to show that we are bringing them something unique and differentiated. I'll give you another example. In talking to the CEO of a really large insurance platform, his take was, ""My team is really caught up in CPAs. They're all about the CPA."" But he's like, ""But, if I acquire you, when you're at the beginning of your career, maybe you start out with car insurance. But then, you buy house insurance and then you buy life insurance. Right? Your LTV is off the charts for me. But, if I acquire someone else who doesn't do those things, then the CPA is nonsensical. What I really want is an LTB."" And so, he was pushing his team to go deeper and deeper. And that goes back to when you have first-party data, the ability to build much more sophisticated, longer-term LTB models is higher. Advertisers absolutely want measurement. They do expect us to perform versus the other platforms they're going to. But the good news is, in many cases, we are more than standing up. I saw a data point last night of a place where we were just killing a couple of other well-known platforms, because of our ability to drive to something that was happening more in real life. These brands that are around getting your oil changed, the whole segment, I'd never really thought of. Another place is healthcare. So, I never thought I would see brands like GSK, Moderna and so on advertising on next door. And yet, of course, because they're advertising things like vaccines, but not just COVID-19, but things like the shingles vaccine or the measles vaccine. And we're better to have that being talked about than in a community level often where there's a lot of vaccine hesitancy. Patrick: I'm very early in my career of being a formal board member at other companies. You've had a cool multi perch approach on this. You've worked with board members. You've had boards you're on the Walmart and Slack boards. I'll finish off my series of excellence questions here. What do you think is an excellent board member? What have stood out about the ones that have been most effective and what have you tried to do to be effective as a board member of big well known companies? Sarah: There's two things I always look at when I'm thinking about becoming a board member, it's a relationship. So first of all, can I have impact on this company? Is this something I'm passionate about? Someone said it the other day, like don't become a board member if you wouldn't go work there. It sounds so darn obvious and yet it's a good way to think about it. And then on the other side, what are you going to learn? Because if you're not getting something back in that relationship, over time you just naturally will get pulled away to other things. So, what's the give get? The second thing I would say about board members, I often describe them as like grandparents, because you get to show up for a lot of the fun stuff, the strategy and so on. But in the end, you have to walk away and let the company operate. And I think very good board members really understand that and I think often newer board members or those that just can't get out of their operational DNA, start to try to run the company.If you're trying to run the company, I actually think you have a CEO problem. So, as a good board member, you should be fixing the CEO, but you shouldn't be trying to run that company. That's just not sustainable, nor is you end up trying to serve multiple masters is never good for any team. And then beyond that, to me comes back to the passion piece. I'm truly passionate about what they're doing. Slack was such an easy board to take, and I really miss them. Not they're part of Salesforce because I live in Slack. I was renowned at Square for my 4:00 AM Slack messages or my 5:00 AM Slack messages. I never gave up my West Coast analyst route. So, I'm a CMBC junkie first thing in the morning and I would be Slacking the whole company with something that I had just seen that I thought was of interest, but I was passionate about the product and the way it was changing, the way we collaborated at work. And so, it just made it so easy to show up with energy every single time they needed me. Patrick: I'm always interested in the things that are most precious to you as habits or practices as a leader. If you were to leave next door and go work at any random company, like no matter what, you would still take these practices or habits with you, what of those stand out most? What would definitely be in your bag? Sarah: Number one, as a leader, two kind of words always try to lead with transparency and then empathy. So, on the transparency front, I'm a super transparent leader and therefore I push that into the company. So, I really don't want to call it like no conversations in dark corners begins with first of all, we write a lot of stuff down. The reason I use a lot of writing alongside discussion and meetings like often meetings will split 50-50 is actually because I think it drives diversity. So, what I've found is that for minority groups, often the introverts often actually a lot of technical people when it's just a talk meeting, they often end up being much more shut down. And so, what I love about writing things down first and reading and commenting on the reading is that you allow the quieter voices to come forward. What I love about writing things down and being transparent and sending it out to everyone. So, for example, our board pre-reads go to the whole company is that there's no revisionist history. Relationships start to matter a little bit less, which might sound odd for someone who's just told you how much human connection matters, but it's no longer are just about who you know, it's about truly what is your talent?What's the talent density you're building as a company? The bad sides of majority is ruling start to dissipate. So, transparency is huge for me, you'll see that in every company I've ever worked in. And then on the empathy side, it goes back to walking in their shoes. So, I will always drive my team anywhere I am to get out to talk to all the stakeholders of the company. And I actually, it's the one way you'll get me a little mad as well is that you come with an idea, but it's not based on any actual conversation with your customer, because then I just think we're making stuff up that we think people need, but not necessarily what they do need. I know you are not going to tell me the buggy web story and da, da, da. I just think those things are so used in Silicon Valley and are super apocryphal. Yeah, there are people like Steve Jobs who saw things that maybe no one else saw, but in reality, 99% of all products are created because of really strong customer insight driven work.",5888
336,Sarah Friar - Building The Local Graph,Ladies Who Launch & Financial Education," Patrick: I'd love to learn a little bit about Ladies who Launch another program that you're a part of. And I don't know a whole lot about what is it? What is your participation and what does it hope to do in the world? Sarah: LWL is a nonprofit organization. I started it with my co-founder Kelly McGonigal back when we were at Square. It was driven out of customer insight. So, we wanted to create an event for women to celebrate International Women's Day. And the thing I knew about creating an in-person event is he is always the keynote. And I was like, we are going to win because Jack Dorsey has our keynote. We had this great event. What we've discovered was that the women most benefited from meeting each other. So, finding each other for peer mentorship. They really benefited from education. There isn't a lot out there of how to start, run and grow your own business, the real specifics. And then they do benefit from the inspiration. But don't tell Jack I'm putting it in a podcast. He was not the home run. People were like, ""Yeah, Jack Dorsey is great but he doesn't look like me. I find it hard. He hasn't really walked in my shoes and he talked much more about inspirational stuff like good stuff.""What I've found subsequently is when you get women or women who have done it, they often end up talking about the really tough times. They talk about like when they were of vulnerable, the things that didn't go right for them. And often for other women listening, that's the moment where OxyContin flows, where they're like, ""I totally get this. I can do this now because I understand that it's tough for everyone."" And so, that began this nonprofit, which originally was a series of in-person events. So, we've done them all over the world, including back home in Northern Ireland, in Belfast for three or four years in a row. We did a lot virtually during the pandemic. And actually one of the things I'm really proud of during the pandemic is we launched our launch program, which actually gives grants to these women because access to capital is one of the major hindrances they have to growing their business. Patrick: Absolutely fascinating. I love it. I love the program. I've been so fascinated. What makes those things tick and work and focusing on the hard times is a really interesting flip of the script from a typical event of that type. We were talking before we hit record about, you mentioned CNBC and being a stock junkie, can't escape that you have teenagers. And I think that's kind of the age at which kid maybe start getting interested in businesses or in stocks or whatever. That's certainly been a democratization of access to these things in the last couple of years, that's notable. How do you teach your kids about all of this stuff? There's so many lessons that we've covered here today. It's hard to get your kids. I have younger kids, but it's hard to get them to listen to you as the parents sometimes. How do you think about financial and business lessons? Like you've got this wealth of knowledge, but you're also a mom. How do you do it? Sarah: This is definitely on my mind at the moment, the whole financial literacy for all, not just my children, but generally across the world. Like it is shocking to me that most kids leave school, do sex ed, they understand nutrition and exercise, but they have no idea how they would balance a bank account or how they would think about financial. It's insane. We kind of just imagine that people will pick that up through osmosis. And so, I think it's a real failing of our educational system. There's something we use a lot in product development called the five whys. And I was trying to push on a group that I belong to about the whys, and they were like, ""Well, why is there's no teachers?"" And I'm like, ""Well, why are there no teachers? Well, they don't get paid enough to do this. They go into banking instead."" And now it's like, ""Well, why don't we get the bankers to go?"" There was not a good reason. And I'm actually working with an organization called Operation HOPE. John Hope Bryant sits my board at Nextdoor, but this is a lot of the why of Operation HOPE is financial literacy, particularly in underrepresented communities. But back to how do you teach your children? My husband and I are both my husband's a hedge fund manager, we're both really interested in investing in stocks. So, it's just part of the dinner table conversation. We definitely have gotten them to open up their SoFi accounts and to buy some stocks and we've talked them through why they're buying. So I mean, they have a small budget to put to work, but we wanted them to create a portfolio, but we wanted them to lean into things they cared about.So, my daughter bought some Adobe, it's had a great return. My son bought Electronic Arts because he loves gaming. It's been a good return, not great. But then we started to get into plant based food. We watched the David Attenborough show. And so, we were like, ""What could we do that's around climate change? So we bought Beyond Meat, which actually hasn't been a great return so far, but I think there's a really good lesson in that about really trying to understand the fundamentals and their estimates have come down. And so, talking to our kids about, this is what happens when you're not beating your results or meeting your results. But how do you think about it over maybe a three and five year, point of view, right? If you still think this is a major trend and where would you be comfortable buying the stock again? A lot of it is just this sheer osmosis of sitting around a table and talking about it. But as parents, I just don't think we do it enough. So, we really try to push it in our household. I don't know what we'll end up with in terms of our kids' outcomes. And I'll tell you one more thing. My son, because of this, we actually pushed my son into a course this summer. And again, this is all from like a place of privilege because we can do that. The teacher who is the CFO of the local school taught this course and he made them do like a retirement plan. And it was like the first time like my son came home and I was like, ""Well how much do you think you need for retirement?"" And he had a number and I was like, ""Wow, it's a pretty big number."" And he was like, ""Well I've got to maintain my standard of living."" and I was laughing But I'm like, ""This is great. You understand maintaining a standard of living."" Talked about social security for first time. Like again, it made me realize just how much that vocabulary is missing from any conversation I ever have with kids. I think collectively we all have to dig in on this. It's not good and it's not setting up our society for good outcomes. Patrick: It's amazing to me the lack of improvement in this area, despite so many smart people understanding that it's a problem. Back to your five why's, like there's some incentive chain problem that's just somebody needs to crack or maybe it's a grassroots thing, but it's a neat topic because it could change a lot. Like it's so cool to imagine the 14 year old kid coming home and figuring this stuff out. I didn't have that as a kid. I grew up in finance. It's crazy. Is there anything that we haven't talked about that matters a lot to you, whether that's in your life, in the business, in just things more generally, any major topic that you think we haven't covered, that we should? Sarah: We talked a little bit about this, not growth at any cost, but I think we should also just talk for a minute on welcoming platforms and what it means to be welcoming. You want to make sure that platforms are diverse. They're kind, they're trusted. And so, it's a place where at Nextdoor, it's easy to lean out when you start to hear words like racism and so on because everyone gets fearful. And yet it's a place where we've explicitly leaned in. The downside of a community based platform are some of the things that we don't like about our society show up there. We could easily try to, I don't know, put a lick of paint on us. Like don't look here when in reality we've said, ""No, this is absolutely something that happens on Nextdoor, but we have to use the product to begin to make it better."" So, we've built in things like anti-racial profiling. So, when someone is putting a post into the newsfeed, if we recognize that they're starting to go down a track of in particular talking about a crime, we take them through a flow that is very explicit about making sure you recognize that how detrimental a post that includes race can be.If that person is innocent, would you feel differently if that person was a different race? So, it just causes a lot of motion from dinosaur brain back to your frontal low just by asking you questions, it slows you down. And again, this is a trade off because in a lot of platforms they want to heat up conversations because that gets people engaged and more and more content being created. We actively slow you down. We've used things like kindness reminder in order to stop you in your tracks almost to remind you that great neighborhoods are created with kindness and ask you to edit something that you're about to post. And so, I think these are all places which are a little bit antithetical to growth, which is often what investors will push you for as a CEO, but long term, we believe a much better outcome for the business and for the business model is that we are viewed as someone who's helping communities not being detrimental. We think it's a really good long term greedy approach. Patrick: Well, I haven't often had the opportunity to ask my final traditional question of someone for whom kindness is a key part of their business model. It's going to be a treat to ask you the same question I ask everybody, what is the kindest thing that anyone's ever done for you? Sarah: I love that you've asked this question. I feel like I now need to have a great answer, I don’t want to blow your horn. I was thinking back on this, because I know that you ask this question. And so, it took me all the way back to growing up in Northern Ireland. And when the first bomb went off in our local village, I grew up in this really small little village of about 1200 people. The local police barracks got blown up and it took out all the windows in the back of our house. We didn't live a particularly big house, all the windows in the back, my bedroom, the dining room, the kitchen, all the windows blew in. So, there's glass everywhere. And it had been a pretty traumatizing day because I had been in primary school. So, I was probably about 10 and we'd all had to shelter on our desks.The bomb finally went off the glass. There came in around us. It almost makes me cheerful thinking back on it. But what was amazing in terms of an act of kind is the minute we walked in the front door and my mom picked us up from work, our neighbors came in, took a look and they went back out and they had figured out where they could go by plywood. And my dad wasn't super handy so we were very grateful for this. They came in and they boarded up all our windows. And I remember Marcella, the mom bringing us hot food cause our kitchen was a disaster. But what made that really poignant is the whole divide in Northern Ireland was religious. And we were Protestant and our door neighbors are Catholic. And so, technically we were meant to hate each other. That's why people were blowing up things. And yet the fact that kindness that they just came that night, I just have such a sense of warmth still because it was a brutal like a day you never forget in your life. That family still lives next door to my mom and dad. They still show amazing kindness to us, but that night really sticks with me. Patrick: For my all time favorite answers, just an incredible, incredible story. Sarah, I have so enjoyed this conversation, your reputation preceded you as someone that I was really excited to talk to. This has been fantastic. Thank you so much for your time.

337,Arman Gokgol-Kline - Universal Music Group: The Gatekeepers of Music,Introduction," Patrick: Today we're breaking down Universal Music Group. It's one of the largest music businesses in the world. UMG is home to many of the world's greatest artists, including Taylor Swift, U2, and the Beatles Catalog. The discussion on UMG requires a deep dive into the history of music itself, how it was historically monetized, the shift from physical to digital and what streaming has meant for various pieces of the ecosystem. Our guest, Arman Gokgol-Kline, a partner and investor at Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb, walks us through that evolution of the music industry before we dive in on UMG. In our discussion, we first break down the industry pre and post-Napster, looking at the ways music was sold historically and that led to both record profits and a consumer revolution. We then assessed streamings impact on the industry and how contrary to what you might think, labels may be more important in a marketplace where it's easier than ever for creators to record and release music. Finally, we finished with UMG's place in the ecosystem, the primary drivers of the business, how they're able to attract the world's superstars and how they think about deploying dollars to acquire new artists and timeless catalogs. Please enjoy this fantastic breakdown of Universal Music Group.",280
338,Arman Gokgol-Kline - Universal Music Group: The Gatekeepers of Music,Historical Inflection Points," Patrick: We get to talk today about one of my absolute favorite topics, which is music and the business behind it. Been obsessed with music since I was right in that sweet spot of Napster. I was just cresting into my music fandom right as Napster came out and so, I think that's the place we have to start. There's this line in the sand in the history of music, maybe it's late '90s, early 2000s, when the whole business changed and we have to start there. Before we talk about UMG, maybe you can begin by just laying out what you view as the important points of history in the business of music. Arman: Yeah. First of all, thanks for having me. You're right. That was a pivotal point for this industry. Prior to this industry, prior to 2000, when Napster and the ripping services emerged, it was an interesting model for this business. You had a few dominant, large labels that controlled every aspect of music from the discovery of the talent, to the producing of the songs, to the recording of the songs, because they own the studios because it was so expensive, to the production of physical distribution, putting it was on CDs and records, to the marketing, to the distribution channel controls. I mean, it was just all controlled by these few groups and as a result, they were affected by the gatekeepers and the way they monetize the music was interesting. If you want to think about it, it was kind of like an upfront perpetual license.You bought an album, it was a bundled product. Back in the days, singles weren't even a big part of the business. So, you had to buy 12, 15 songs from an artist in an album format. You had to pay upfront for the perpetual use of that and every incremental piece of music you bought cost you money. You had to have this high threshold for wanting to consume incremental music beyond just listening passively on the radio station, if you want on demand access to your product. And for the record labels and for the industry, that meant profits were heavily front end loaded. And so, the whole system was set up to not drive consumption through life, but to drive initial sales after launch. That's when almost all the profits for the industry were made.The other thing it did for the industry is basically five markets drove the great majority of the revenues and profits. US, UK, Germany, France, Japan were three quarters of the revenues of the entire industry because you had respect for IP rights in those markets and then you had a willing and able consumer base to pay for those rights. That was the model that was set up by the industry and by the labels of, let's call it, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 years. I mean, that was basically the way it worked.If you want to think about it though, is that really the best consumer proposition? Which is hey, you have to buy a bundled product. I control what comes to market. Once it comes to market, you have to pay a pretty sizable upfront cost to buy it. Then you can use it forever as long as you keep the physical product with you, but every time you hear something new and want to listen to it a second time or third time, fourth time on demand, you have to go pay me for it. And that's what the ripping services to me were.It was two things. One is it was trying to solve a consumer problem with the industry and then two, is technology was enabling this digital consumption of music and the industry just was not forward on that. iTunes was a reaction, if you will, to the ripping services, whereas you could have argued actually it should have been what drove the consumer to the digital format. Late '90s, the world says, ""Hey, we don't like this model. We want to be able to listen to individual songs when we want and we want to not have to pay a whole lot of money every time we want to consume a new piece of music,"" and so you have the Napster's of the world show up and try to break the mold.Now interestingly, that wasn't actually a great format for consumers either. First of all, it was actually a time-consuming process. I am also a product of, I was in college in the late '90s, without incriminating myself, I may have known people that and it would take a fair bit of time to find the content. Yeah. It was like a job. Try to burn the CD if you wanted access to it on- Patrick: CDRW. Arman: Right, exactly. And then beyond that, the quality consistency was not there. It was just actually not great quality. By the way, it was illegal. And so, there was these three consumer problems with that as well, but it was the first sign to the industry that hey, this old model that you have, which worked great for you when you controlled all aspects of it. As technology emerged and we were able to try to find ways of pushing back on this not so great consumer proposition, consumers were basically like, ""We're going to change the way this works.""Not surprisingly, profits for this industry globally peaked in 1999 and believe it or not, in nominal dollars, we're still not back to those profit whether it’s 20 years later, much less in real dollars. From the late '90s to mid-teens to mid-2010s, the industry was in decline, partly because of this ripping issue coming to the fore, but partly because they weren't offering the consumer a product they wanted that was increasingly becoming digital in the consumers buying, but not so much digital in the industry's mind.The first attempt by the industry to solve that was iTunes. Essentially said, ""Hey, we're going to try to get past this issue of you having to buy physical media. We understand you want digital and so, we're going to offer you consistent quality, a good UX, and we're going to be able to deliver the product to you. Oh, and we understand that you don't like this bundling idea and so, we're going to offer you the ability to buy individual songs as opposed to just buying albums.""And so that certainly helped a little bit with demand, but it didn't solve this more monetization issue that consumers seem to have, which was why do I need to pay every new piece of content I want to consume? And in fact, if you want to think about the original price when it was like 99 cents on iTunes, it eventually went up from there, but effectively if you think of an album as 14, 15 songs and an album cost 14, $15, all they did is they just divided the number of songs by the price of the album, that was the price point for Apple. The consumer proposition wasn't fully resolved. It was just a step by the industry in the direction. It also wasn't great for the industry because you had essentially one distribution channel that controlled the market. And so, it was a powerful model for them.And so it helped, but we didn't see a major reaction in terms of return to growth and monetization in the market. That really started to change around 2014, 2015 as streaming came to the market and streaming, to me, solves not only the first point, which is around the UX and the digital experience, but it solves the monetization point too, which is now you have product coming to market where you're saying, ""Hey, not only do you have digital consumption, consistent quality of product, and you can digitally carry around your product, listen to it on demand, but I'm going to give you access to almost every song ever recorded in the Western world for a fixed, all you can eat, platform.""And so that solves to me, the bigger part of the consumer proposition which again, potentially led to the initial issues that the industry was having in 1999 with people saying, ""Hey, why are we having to consume the content you were trying to sell us in the way we are, but on top of that, why are we having to pay for this in the way that we are? I don't want to listen to the same song 50 times. I want to be able to listen to different songs, but what about being able to do it on demand?""And so if you want to just think about pricing on a per capita basis, back in 1999 in the US the average consumer spent about $80 a year on music. If you look to today and look at the including promotional price plans that the major streaming companies offer today, it's about $80 a year. In the Western world and the big markets, we've come back a little bit full circle to say, ""Hey, we'd like you to consume music at the price points you were comfortable with,"" and this is nominal. We haven't gotten into real yet, but for that price we're not going to give you a vastly better experience.The market has reacted. So just to give you an idea, I mean 2014 was really the year where we started to see Spotify was the leader in this industry scale. It was founded in 2006, but it's first five, 10 years of existence, it was a much smaller business, just trying to A, get the access to the content that it needed and then B, just to build it out. From 2014 to 2021, we've gone from a very small percentage of Americans consuming music streaming, to last year, 60% plus of Americans are now consuming music through streaming. So, the markets reacted in a very positive way and good news for the industry in a way that now starts to bring this idea of value and price to music content. Patrick: Absolutely amazing history that involves something creative that we all consume probably on a daily or weekly basis and also technology disrupting and making possible a new consumer value proposition. It begs the question, I come at this conversation as a very biased, enormous fan of Spotify, the service and the business and the leadership there. And so, it's fun to talk about sort of the other side of the equation. You mentioned that prior to, let's call it 1999, that major music labels, they were sort of vertically integrated, controlled the entire value chain end to end and obviously profits reflected that back in 1999.We haven't gotten back there, which is wild to consider because it feels like music has gotten, if anything, more ubiquitous as part of our daily life and TikTok and all these different places, there's more and more soundtrack to our lives. And so, I'd love to understand what the industry of music labels itself looks like. I promise we'll get to Universal here not too long from now, but was this and is this an oligopoly? How did those businesses evolve from the heyday of the late '90s through to how they look today as businesses and how they monetize? Arman: We are kind of in an oligopoly today. Over two thirds of the market is controlled by the big three. This is Western music. I'm talking about that part of the market. Just to be clear, 60% of consumption of music in each individual country tends to be local content. So it is important to understand that when we talk about Western music, we're talking about Western markets and excluding some markets that are emerging and it's something we should talk about later, which is in the old days, as I mentioned earlier, five markets drove the entire business. We are seeing that start to break down with the emergence of streaming as well. But it is effectively an oligopoly today and it was an industry that really started to consolidate pre-1999, so that you had some major players emerging because there are real scale benefits to this business.But to your point, they were the gatekeeper. As we just talked about, if you wanted to have the money to record a song before an album before, you needed them in terms of production assistance, you need them in terms of studio time, you needed them to burn your CDs and distribute your CDs and market your products and get access to the retailers, the Targets, the Walmart's of the world or Tower Records, if we can all remember that, and put your content so it had a prominent place and sell through. To your point, technology fundamentally changed that and so, not only did it change distribution which we've been talking about with the Spotify's of the world, but technology changed other things.Today, with a decent software program on a laptop and a few hundred dollars of equipment like this mic that I'm talking on now from Amazon, I can produce studio quality sound. I don't need a label anymore to go produce a high quality soundtrack. Using social media, I can now market my product and I can actually communicate with my fans globally, forget locally. Technology has not only disrupted the distribution side, which is I can push a button now and push it out on streaming platforms to the world over and when we talk about this, there are services that will do that for you for 20 bucks a year or something, but I can actually produce the content. I can actually do some basic marketing and all of that.So, the model of the major labels certainly has changed, but by the way, after 15 years of decline and pressure, we are now in a world where the major labels continue to be the dominant players in the market and so, a good question is why is that? What is their value today to the consumer and to the artist? Democratization of music has done some things that are scary for the labels. It's also done some things that are scary for artists.So in 2000 a report I saw a little while ago, talked about roughly one and a half million songs a year came to market. Last year, 22 million songs were uploaded on Spotify. We have 60,000 songs a day and growing being uploaded to Spotify and Spotify is, like I said, the leading platform, but there are other platforms out there certainly outside the US, in the Western world in particular, but that is a scary proposition for any artist, including the biggest artists because in the old days, yes, you had these gatekeepers that you had to get access to, but once you got there, you didn't have quite as much competition. And if they featured you, you were what the world listened to. Today, you're like, ""How do I cut through 22 million soundtracks a year so that I get listened to?"" And that's a challenge for the industry and that's a challenge for artists and that's a challenge for everyone.Secondly, your strengths to distribution increasingly get fragmented. So in the early days of streaming Spotify as the leader was the dominant platform, but we've seen not only other large leading streaming platforms develop and we can get into that dynamic because that's a very interesting part of the market as well, but we've now started to see distribution channels beyond just streaming develop. So, Spotify's share of major label digital revenues has actually dropped over the last few years, not grown. That's because you're starting to see use cases like Peloton, like TikTok, like Roblox, like all these, to your point that you made earlier Pat, you're starting to see new use cases emerge for this content to becoming more ubiquitous. And the owners of the IP are starting to generate revenues beyond just the pure streaming.Now streaming is still the most important digital channel by far, but you're starting to see these new things emerge. So for an artist, there is a lot more complexity to distributing your product now. It's not just about what are my CD sales in the various retail channels. It's that, retail is still a not insignificant part of the market. It's streaming and by the way, there is a handful of streaming companies depending on which country you go to that dominate those markets that you need access to. And now there's all these new channels emerging on top of that and so, you need someone who can help you with that. And beyond that, the traditional roles of I'd love to have my content featured on video. I'd love to have my content featured in live and these kinds of things. So, there's a lot more complexity to it.Third, global reach, as we talked about, it used to be five markets. So, if I figured out what US, UK, Germany and Japan, what my strategy was, I basically cover the market. That is now starting to break down where we're starting to see other markets. So, the top five share has gone from about 75% to the high 60s in just the last five years because we're starting to see monetization of the other channels emerge and so, that's yet more complexity for these artists to deal with. And then finally, even though the top artists as a group drive the majority of streams, over half the streams come from the top 50 artists, which is not surprising if you think about it. No individual artist over multiple rolling years is a significant part of the market. In any one year, the leading driver of streams in a market is usually low single digits market share and it's rare that you see over five years the same person headline every year. And so, it's hard for an individual artist to be able to go to these distribution platforms and say, ""Hey, you really need me,"" because the distribution platforms are like, ""Hey, that's true. It's great. You're awesome. You're 3% of my streams, and that doesn't help me a whole lot."" Just step back to the role of the majors today, they still have this traditional VC and production ecosystem role, which they've always had. They fund the production of music. They have a big portfolio of superstars that they can say, ""Hey, why don't you guys do a song together,"" or they can bring in superstar producers, give you a little bit of an edge as you bring to market. On top of that now, they still have all the guts of the physical. They have this marketing promotion organization globally that we just talked about that's being set up to deal with this complexity. And perhaps most importantly, they have scale in a way that no one individually has.So, UMG is the largest global label, major label, and they have a high 30 share of streaming overall. And when you walk into Spotify with a high 30 share versus a two to 3% share, and you're in the high 30s every year, it's a different conversation, not only for the label, but for the artists who they're putting together, and then... Who they're representing. And then finally is data. Data's becoming a hugely important aspect of this business. Again, an individual can tie into data streams from various outlets, be it social media, be it streaming, but the ability to capture a full picture, looking at the physical, looking at the global data, looking at every outlet, again, when I have 39, 40% market share in a market, I get data in a way that is very hard for even indie labels to get. We've talked to indie labels who will tell you the majors have a data edge in this business.",4071
339,Arman Gokgol-Kline - Universal Music Group: The Gatekeepers of Music,A Superstar's Perspective," Patrick: I'd love to take this from the perspective of an artist. Let's imagine I'm Billie Eilish or something. I think she's under the UMG umbrella. How does it feel for her, and maybe even in the life cycle of an emerging artist that goes from an unknown to a global superstar, how does it feel for me to engage with a label today? You've highlighted the reasons why maybe if it was all Spotify, I could just go directly to them. But the fragmented side of both sides makes it so that it's probably five artists that could have big companies just as themselves, really hard to manage all this stuff. So, just give me the perspective of the creator here, and why what's old is new again, it sounds like? There was this long period in the desert, and now we're reemerging where these labels once again have power and are the preferred partners of the artists, which is contra-narrative. Arman: It's funny, I spoke to a professor at Berkeley College of Music, which one of creme-de-la-creme music schools in the country, about various aspects of this business. And one of my favorite stories he told me is every year I ask my students to raise their hand when I say to them, ""Who likes labels and wants to work with a label?"" And nobody raises their hand. And then he says, ""Okay, now imagine one of the major labels comes to you and gives you an upfront and wants to sign you. Who would sign on with them?"" And everyone raises their hand. I think it's part of this is as an artist, you don't love the idea of being beholden to profit driven organization that's going to take a cut of your profits, and that doesn't feel so great. But the reality is we've seen from share that they're necessary. And to this day, the number of artists that have come to market and succeeded like a Billie Eilish without the support of a major label, I can certainly count them on one hand. It's just not a very big number. It's a very difficult thing to do. And to the extent it's happened, it's mostly happened in hip hop, which happens to be a genre that allows for that a little bit more than a pop or a rock.For an artist, I think of it as when you're just trying to get yourself noticed, like I said, you can do that by coming to the market, you can get access. There are companies like TuneCore and DistroKid, which will, for a very small fee, take your product. You can be active and savvy with social media and get the product to market. But at some point, that can only get you so far, because you're not getting featured on playlists on the Spotifys of the world. You're certainly not seeing all the data about global. There are examples of someone notices CDs are physical, still a big part of the Japanese market, and all of a sudden, as Billie Eilish, you might have a label that comes to you and says, ""Oh, by the way, your CD sales just start spiking in Japan. Maybe you should put them on the world tour and let's push some new products there, right?"" That's not something you can easily do on your own.So, there are just parts of the market that are hard to access. A good story here is the early days of streaming and disruption, we started to see some of the mega stars go out to the market and try to do exclusives. So, I don't know if you remember, YouTube and Beyonce were doing exclusives with Apple for a while, and Beyonce and Jay Z with Tidal. And when you talk to people in the industry about their experience with that and why we haven't really seen that continue, it's because, yeah, okay, you can capture 30, 40, 50% of the market with great economics for you as an artist, but as an artist, your brand, and thus you, the economic value of you, of your product is tied to not just streaming and getting the product out. In a way, streaming is marketing for a lot of top of funnel, right? It's top of funnel. Just bring people in, bring my fans in, and then let me go try to interact with them in live shows.And limiting your distribution to any individual small contract, or even big ones, so even if Spotify was 70% of the market, it may not make sense to sign up with Spotify because I'm still missing 30% of that market. And I only get a small percentage of my... Maybe not small, but certainly not the majority of my income from streaming royalties. I get it from this ecosystem I built. Really, as an artist, my goal is to increase the value of that ecosystem, not just purely the streaming income from it. And so, as an artist, what you're trying to do the whole time is A, get noticed, and then once you get noticed, get somebody who has heft behind them to get your product to be more featured, so you can get more noticed, you can go up in scale. And we've actually seen this in the labels and in the disruptors on the label side, where you have individual players that have each developed underneath the major label superstar service offering to try to bring you off the funnel there.But the goal of any artist is to be a superstar. I've talked to, certainly not every artist in the world, but I've talked to a number of them in this project over the years. And I have yet to talk to one, when you say, ""Hey, what's the goal here?"" And they're like, ""I want to be a superstar. That's the goal."" And to be a superstar, it means maximum distribution, maximum marketing, maximum recognition. That's the challenge for any artist. And as they're going through it, yes, they have all these things they don't like about the labels, which is I have to give them some of my economics, arguably, as I'm coming up the superstar curve, but even at the top, Taylor Swift signed with UMG for a reason. If there was an artist in the world who did not have to sign with a label, in my opinion, it was Taylor Swift. She's incredibly business savvy. She's got unbelievable following. She's a huge global superstar. And yet she chose to sign with a major label. Now, there's no doubt as has been the case for many, many, many decades, when you become a superstar, you'd have a different economic proposition than you do if you're a start-up artists.But the challenge for every artist is to try to get up that curve and stay at the top of that curve. And then coming back to this 22 million songs a year point, whether you're Billie Eilish, Taylor Swift, or a startup, you're just trying to get maximum amount of time in an increasingly crowded world. And that means you just need someone who can access all parts of the world, and also has some scale to be able to push your product so that you can attain and then stay on top. Now, one important side note to make here is that on surface, one could argue the proposition of the major labels is losing relevance with artists because their share of the overall recorded music market has actually declined by a few percentage points over the last handful of years. But if you dig a little deeper, the reason indie labels and direct distribution have gained a bit of share is related to the fact that as we spoke about earlier, we've seen the barrier to creating and distributing music collapse.If you recall, in 2000, it was really difficult for a small or even mid tier artist to get their product to market, right? The major labels were, and to some extent, still are geared to creating and marketing superstars. So, scaled artists, given their kind of high service costs, have always worked with the major labels, whereas the small and mid tier artists, it wasn't the right offering for them. As the barriers for small and mid tier artists fell, their share of the market increased from a very small number to a slightly larger number, which means superstars and the major labels that represent them have effectively lost a bit of share. But this is really mostly occurring on the periphery. As a group, we're talking about a few percentage points of share loss for the majors over the last handful of years. And that's because this is still an industry where superstars dominate. And by the way, as it relates to UMG, for what it's worth, they've lost the least share among the big three over the last five years or so. Patrick: Before we come back to the specific business breakdown aspect for UMG specifically, there's just so many cool aspects of this business. So, if I am a superstar, if I'm Taylor Swift, what does that average business look like? So, if I've achieved that upper status, where's my revenue coming from on average, and how high is the variance of that artist to artists? Is it pretty consistent? Arman: Very high variance. Extremely high variance, certainly within genres. So, every genre has a very different dynamic. Certain genres have very strong live income streams. Other genres have less live income, very strong streaming, less strong streaming. Rock has been a slower adopter of streaming than hip hop, which has been a leading adopter of streaming than pop, which is almost as strong as hip hop. And so, for every artist in a different genre, it changes. Certainly, artists by age demographic change, because we can talk about this, but streaming, as with most technologies, is first adopted by the youngest then the maturest. And we're seeing that happening. Most people's soundtrack of their lives, as the industry talks, it is created from the late teens to the mid to late twenties. That's what you listen to your whole life for the most part, and your discovery goes down pretty quickly after that.And so, depending on where you fit as an artist and your fan demographic, you will have a different mix as well. But once you're a superstar, for most superstars, concerts are a very significant driver of revenue. And as we just talked about, streaming is really top of funnel. How do I bring fans in to that funnel then monetize them, not only through the streaming, but really then through these live shows, where I have merch involved, I have higher price points? And just to be clear, live is a small driver of the major labels' business. That's really a separate company, that handful of companies around the world, frankly, that tend to lead in that business. It's not so much that even though streaming might for a major, major artist be a minority of income compared to live, it's still the enabler of the live revenue.And so, that's the challenge for them, really is, and this is what the Beyonces of the world, what they realized, which is why we've seen the breakdown in this exclusive streaming model that developed and didn't really go that far, is because for them, it's all about maximum reach, fill the funnel, so that when I go live, I can get as many people as I can to my shows, buying my merch, buying my products. It's more interrelated than just to say, ""Hey, I should just maximize for live and streaming as a small driver of my income,"" because one tends to drive the other.",2467
340,Arman Gokgol-Kline - Universal Music Group: The Gatekeepers of Music,UMG's Business Model," Patrick: So, we've got streaming, merch, live, maybe this new category of more fragmented distribution, so maybe I start making running and roadblocks for TikTok or whatever, and that's kind of in the streaming-ish category. I'm getting paid the more my IP is being used in various different platforms. It's a great excuse to bring the conversation back to UMG. And here's some... I think there's some inside baseball that we just need to walk through to really understand their business, including something like the difference between recorded music and music publishing. I don't think people would intuitively know what that difference is. You can now start to level set for UMG specifically, what is their business today? What drives it? What are the key terms or ideas to understand in terms of how they drive revenue? Arman: The two major categories are recorded music and music publishing. Recorded music is over 80% of revenues and profits, so that is by far the biggest driver. And what recorded music is, it's frankly, probably most people think about when they think about a label. It's the discovery and development of recording artists, related marketing promotion, sponsored distribution, and licensing of the recorded sound. So, what they're talking about is the actual recorded music element, developing and monetizing that part of it. So, if U2 sings a song, U2's production and sound and product from that recording studio is the recorded music element of it.The publishing element of it ties more to the written music and the written lyrics. But that can then be performed by various people in slightly different styles. And so, that is a second separate, and frankly, a smaller driver of the industry, and certainly for UMG. For UMG, not only is recorded music big because recorded music generates the majority of the revenue for the industry, but UMG's share of recorded music is also much higher than it is its share of publishing. It's number one in recorded music, it's number two in publishing. And we can talk about... This is also regulated. Each country has some regulations around how much value goes to publishers versus not. There are some regulations which are also actually always in discussion. There's some talk about potentially that percentage going up for publishing. There's other talk that it won't. But long story short, just think of one as the recorded music, the recorded song itself by the artist versus the written song and the written lyrics.And then if you look at UMG, within recorded music, they just really break it down by the different distribution channels. So, you have streaming, which is the streaming revenue, which is now over 50% of all of UMG's revenues, by the way. And then you have physical, which is the old model of CDs and vinyl. We just had a resurgence. You have digital download, which is the old iTunes model, which is declining pretty rapidly as streaming is coming up. And then you have a licensing category, and you can think of that as video games, roadblocks, things like that, where licensing revenues tend to come in. And that kind of makes up your recorded music part of the business. Within publishing, it's mostly publishing rights. And so, a publishing label will either acquire those rights through catalog or represent an artist's rights. And their sole, really, raison d'etre in publishing is to ensure that the writer of the song and the lyrics is compensated every time someone utilizes that asset.And so, it's a much simpler business. There's certainly a little bit of a promotion element to it, but nothing like it is in recorded music, where you're trying to find artists to create music. It's a little bit less of that element and more of a fee collection business, if you will, which we can talk about. But technology is probably a little bit more concerning on that side of the business that it is on the recorded music side. We can certainly get into that, but those are the two big drivers. Merch is a small single digit driver of the business. Low margin compared to the other two. The margins within publishing and recorded music for UMG and for the industry are actually just starting to cross over. Recorded music is a very fixed cost business, if you will. It costs me X to find an artist and produce a song. The more I can sell that song, the higher the margin I receive, because the incremental margin is really high. And so, what we're seeing with the growth that's happening in the industry right now is recorded music margins are really improving quickly as both mix shift towards streams, which is a high margin channel. Plus, just general fixed cost leverage is happening. That's been less of an element in the publishing business. Patrick: What are the general margins of the business? Just... And the trends in them? Arman: So, UMG's overall margins have expanded from the low teens to the high teens over the last five years or so. That's mostly been driven by significant margin improvement in the recorded music business, where margins have expanded from the low teens to call it now the low 20s. And that's primarily due to mix shift towards high margin streaming revenues, but also fixed costs leveraged from higher revenues. So, if you want to think about that as there's a more or less fixed cost of discovering an artist, producing music, marketing the music, distributing the content. And so, as you generate more revenues off that same content, you have pretty high incremental margins. There's also an aspect of lumpy digital royalty streams, but reporter figures are generally a pretty fair representation of the trends and underlying profitability of the business. Though publishing businesses earned a low 20s operating margin for a number of years now. Again, those lumpy royalty claims move things around a little bit, but that's a more stable margin business historically. Looking forward, management's guiding to a mid 20s EBITDA margin, which you can call a low 20s operating margin. And that's, again, being driven by this mix shift towards digital revenue, streaming revenues, and this fixed cost leverage. Patrick: Let's talk about just ownership of IP a little bit here. I think one of the things that people will think about, I can't remember who the feud was with, but Taylor Swift, there was a famous feud over ownership of back catalog. How does this work? Is it perpetual? If I buy an album from someone, do I own that music forever? How does the artist figure in here? Is there any sort of model where the artists owns some of it directly? How does the IP rights thing here work? Because it just seems like a critical piece of how monetization can happen in the future. Arman: So, think about the IP in two silos. One is catalog, which is effectively someone owns a bunch of IP, sometimes the artist, sometimes another studio, the music that was produced historically, and you can buy that. Two is called an upfront artist payment, where you are paying an artist to go create IP. So, just think of that as the two big buckets in IP, and there are slightly different nuances around both. But in the US, generally speaking, and this is constantly being litigated, in general, you have a 90 plus year right to content. What the labels have historically said is for content that we are paying an upfront for, it's actually a work for hire arrangement. We are hiring someone to create content for us that we will own. The old model, certainly, and this is slightly changing, we should talk about that, has been it's work for hire, we own the IP, period. You go create it. We pay you a fee for it. That's what the upfront is in return for you to go create IP for us. But it's our IP, and we get that right to the IP until IP laws allow it to revert either to an artist or to become essentially a non-IP.For catalog, it originally starts there, but then you can sell your IP rights to someone for some sum of money, and then you get the rights to what's remaining in that IP. Not surprisingly, new artists who are early in their careers, who are just looking to get a break, will sign over, even to this day, the great majority of them will sign over those IP rights. Because just think of it as, would you rather have 100% of a small pie or a less of a much bigger pie? And that's what every artist is struggling with, certainly in the early days. The other thing is nine out of 10 artists do not become long term long term superstars. It's a very hard business to break out in much less stay on top in. It's a struggle for them to go do that. And so there's a challenge for artists to try to put themselves in a position where they have the maximum opportunity for success and they are willing to hand over their IP rights for that early in their career. As you move forward in your career to a Taylor Swift scenario, and by the way, Taylor's early IP was owned by this other label for this exact reason. Taylor eventually got to the point where when she was renegotiating her contract, she was able to say, hey- Patrick: I'm Taylor swift. Arman: By the way, we're pretty sure my IP- Patrick: This is going to work. Yeah. Arman: This isn't going to work. I want some of my IP. It's like, I don't want whether it's a percentage or it's a 10 year reversion or whatever it might be.I want access to my IP again. This again is actually not super new. This has been happening for years and years and years like a Bruce Springsteen or a U2, every time they were renewing their contract, they were probably getting more rights or certainly more economics to their IP. So as you move up that charity curve as an artist, you get more access to your IP either in economic terms or in perversions. And I think what's becoming more common now is reversions of IP back to the artist after X number of years. That's not necessarily a big deal for the labels. The vast, vast majority of the economic value of IP is the first 10 years of life, actually the first three years of life, but certainly the first 10. And so if you have IP reverting in years five through 10, you're giving something up, but not to the point where it's truly pressuring your business.And again, to the point I was making earlier, this is not completely new, but that IP is a very hot topic, it is this work to hire arrangement is something that's constantly being pushed and pressured. And again, that's just the US, there are different IP rules in almost every country you go to about when rights are revert to an artist. There's currently a report that came out from a investigation in the UK parliament that said IP rights should be reverting much earlier to artists because it's not fair to them. And so there's now talk about whether the UK could legislate something where IP writes revert to artists more. I think labels fairly basically said, you can do that, but then upfront payments are going to collapse because it's a simple risk adjusted ROI for us. We have to take more risk for less payback. We're just going to underwrite less artists.",2471
341,Arman Gokgol-Kline - Universal Music Group: The Gatekeepers of Music,Balance of Power Between Labels and Streaming Platforms," Patrick: When I was doing the research for this, one of the stats that most popped out allows us to talk about now since streaming is such a key aspect of recorded music revenues for the major labels in UMG, understanding the contractual arrangements for how much they earn per stream with the Spotifys of the world is really, I think, key and important. And I'm just fascinating by this dynamic. And I want to talk about like the differences between a variable cost structure like Spotify has versus maybe something more fixed like a Netflix has created, but the eye-popping stat was in a dollar of streaming revenue.We'll get to how that comes to be a dollar, that labels get like 75%, artists get like 11, the publishers and songwriters actually get more than the artists, 16% or something like that. It really makes your point earlier about the streaming is top of funnel. Yes, they're getting paid, but maybe live is way more part of their business. This is almost like they're getting paid to market to their end consumer, which is cool concept. Is that equilibrium interesting to you in any way that it's roughly the pie for a dollar of streaming revenue looks like that. And then I want to get into the balance of power between the record labels in music and the streamers versus other platforms like video. Arman: That's a slightly misleading stat because of catalog. Over half of music consumed is catalog that's owned by the labels. The artist doesn't get payment on those because the label owns the IP and in many cases doesn't share it. They bought a catalog, like Bob Dylan sold his catalog to UMG for hundreds of millions of dollars last year, essentially. Patrick: He cashed out, he went upfront versus ongoing. Yeah. Arman: And we can talk about ROIs, which are absolutely something that is a hot topic in this industry about those sums that are being paid. But all I would say is it's not quite as extreme as that makes it sound which is these labels just capture all this value for no real economic benefit on the backend. Hey, it should be the artist capturing more of it. Also very infrequently, the artist is also the publisher, at least in some way, whether it was lyrics or things. So there's sharing that happens there as well. But yeah, that's right. I mean basically the way it tends to work is recorded music label revenue streams, over half go to the label, what they call A and R costs, then revert back to the artist, whether that's in the form of an upfront, which again would be slightly different than the way that statistic you gave was broken down or in the way in the form of revenue share.So just in terms of how an upfront works is a label signs on an artist, pays them a hundred thousand or a million dollars to go produce a one, two or three albums. The artists, once the product launches, all of the revenue and profit reverts back to the label till that initial investment is recouped after which you see the profit stream happen. Not surprisingly, nine out of 10 products that come to market do not recoup their initial investment. So again, yes, the label is capturing a lot of the revenue, but actually they're just trying to get kind of initial investment bank before that split happens. And so much capital goes into that upfront that that's part of it. Now those percentages of those hit rates by the way are increasing. And this is an interesting element to talk about partly because data and social media and all that's our predictive ability on this IP is improving.And so dollars going to the artists are actually inflating as a result of that, because they can say, hey, I'm a more proven product today than I would've been 20 years ago. I want more economics. Also, the value of IP is going up because of streaming and so labels are paying more, but at the same time, the hit rates on those portfolios are starting to improve too because everything is becoming a little bit more knowable.I already have 20,000 fans on Facebook and Instagram and Snap. And so hey, I'm a more known product. That's kind of how I think about it, which is as long as the label and the major label in particular is crucial to success and global reach and cutting through the noise. And this aspect of an upfront remains, which by the way, it's a good deal for an artist. If nine out of 10 upfronts don't get recouped, you're getting a shot on average. Patrick: On average, it's a great idea. Arman: Right? You're getting a shot on goal. The problem is for the one out of 10 that hits it big or hits it- Patrick: It's a bad deal. Yeah. Arman: It feels like a bad deal. But as a portfolio, it's like a VC fund. Patrick: It literally is, the power law driven outcome thing. Arman: Exactly. And there are other players out there who can try to play in that less so on the upfronts, more so on the catalog, the hypnosis of the world. But it really is like a VC in some ways, right? Which is you pay for the upfront and then you have the tools in place to maximize the success rate of that upfront as a major label. And as long as that dynamic remains, I think they're in good shape.Plus what really gives them the half and I should have touched on this earlier is that catalog, when half or more than half of music consumed is catalog, catalog is more than 18 months deep catalog kind of think of as few years old. But over half is catalog and over 40% is deep catalog. And that tends to be much more tightly owned by the major labels. It's hard for anyone to try to scale up and get that hef, because even if I'm Spotify, I can't have a service without access to that contact. And there's no way for me to compete say UMG wanted too much money for that back catalog. They pulled their catalog and a bunch of their artists from me. So I Spotify offer 40 million songs. Yeah. Amazon and Apple offer 70 million. But hey, most of what you want is here. The consumers going to say, thanks, but I'd rather go with the exact same price point. Patrick: See ya. I want to listen to Beatles and Zepplin. Arman: Yeah, like I want to have all the music. I think that economic model cut where the labels earn what they do is sound and there's pressures on it. We can talk about that, but it's for now it's sound. Patrick: So if we keep reducing the dimensions of what matter here, you come pretty quickly to the bargaining position and power of the labels with the streamers. I'd love to understand the history of this. And maybe again, like I said before, contrasted against other media examples where there's like a dominant Netflix or whatever it is like a distribution streaming platform with the IP creation side of the business and why it's shaken out differently in different spaces. So just give us sort of a lesson on the history of this bargaining relationship, which is so critical. There's such a symbiosis between the labels and the streamers and yeah, just kind of explain the bargaining power of both sides and how you see that playing out. Arman: Sure. So let's use video because I just think it's a great example. If you think about music and how you consume music, you actually consume catalog product a lot. I certainly do. And I think most consumers do. Songs that I've listened to once, I will listen to again and again, and again, at some point. With video, that's less the case. Once I watch season X of what Y show, I probably am not going to go back and watch it. Same with a movie. I might watch a movie a couple times. My favorites I might watch a handful of times, but I'm not consuming that catalog like I am. So if you want to think about a streaming platform like a Netflix, their power is in using scale to develop new IP because the way you keep people in your ecosystem is new IP. You want them continuously coming back to watch the new thing and to engage with the new product.With music, it's different. With music, not only is new IP important, but old catalog IP is important. So on Spotify, some new stats that came out about 37% of their playlists are heavily weighted towards new music. 39% are heavily weighted towards catalog. So catalog is just a huge part of the experience for the consumer, which gives power to people who own IP historically, as opposed to just creating new IP. It's a slightly different dynamic, which is important. So if the world of music was like video, where it was all about who's creating the new artist and the new song and that's all that matters in terms of your product as a Spotify, Spotify can go out and say, hey, I don't care what the labels own or used to own. I'm going to pay up for new artists up front. I'm going to create new music and I'm going to bring everyone in.Because I'm going to have the hottest new songs. The problem is the consumer wants more than that. They want the old stuff to. So all of a sudden the power in that relationship moves from the distributor who can create new content and also has the consumer relationship to who owns the IP that the consumer wants, the IP that consumer wants a lot of it is owned by these labels. The other thing is we want access. As we talked about the consumer proposition of the old model versus the new, what we didn't like about the old model was we were restricted in the content we could consume, whether it was new music or old music. And so anytime you start constricting the amount of access I have to the world's catalog, tens of millions of songs, that becomes a tough consumer proposition.And so what you've ended up with, not surprisingly, is a few key players that happen to own the majority of the IP that is kind of a must have in this industry to have a product offering and a handful of distributors that have gotten scale on distribution of great user experiences like a Spotify, Amazon, a YouTube, whoever you might want to think about in that bucket, but they are dependent on the IP of the labels. And as a result, the labels are advantaged also in the new IP, because they can say, hey, I can bundle all this together as an offering and I'm a really important aspect of reaching different artists, of reaching different distribution channels, of reaching different countries and all this stuff. And so that small difference in how we consume music versus video has led to this position where the distributor has really, in one instance, the distributor becomes the powerful creator to the historic owner of IP continues to be the powerful creator of new content.And the distributor is really a pure distributor of content and needs access to the old stuff to be able to offer something. I would argue that pure music offering is a semi commoditized product at this point between Apple, Spotify, Amazon, YouTube, Deezer, we can kind of go through title. What you're seeing from some of these players is their attempts to differentiate are less so about music and more so about other categories where they can at least own the IP. It's a more emerging category where there isn't a whole lot of old IP. And so how do I, podcasting, for example, how do I create new IP and try to get that type of a position? It's a difficult one for the distributors. And they're absolutely important aspects of this distribution channel, but they don't have a product without access to that core IP that's majority owned by three companies.",2613
342,Arman Gokgol-Kline - Universal Music Group: The Gatekeepers of Music,Capital Allocation & Investing in IP," Patrick: It's a brilliant description of the difference. Kind of so simple when you hear you lay it out like that. And it also then leads us to the next obvious category, which is building that IP catalog. The Dylan example is maybe a fun one to explore. And it also explains, obviously I think this is where we can get into scale economies, why more and more power might start to accrue with more and more buying power to the top couple of players. And I think we need for universal specifically, like it's fun just to hear the stuff that's in their portfolio.Like when I looked at it, you probably don't appreciate it if you don't know it intimately, but it's so many of the interesting labels, whether it's Def Jam or Interscope on the hip hop side or others elsewhere. But talk to me a little bit about, I'll call it the investing or capital allocation side of these businesses building up these IP catalogs and how they think about things like return on investment, how dollars are deployed and what the napkin math is for making a purchase like however much it was for Dylan's back catalog. Because if that's the thing that drives their power, again, as we continue to focus on what matters here, skill at this and competition in this area is a key competitive frontier. Arman: Yeah. I agree a hundred percent with that. Now to some extent they already own so much of the IP that even if they started losing a lot of the IP that's coming to market- Patrick: They'd have power for a long time. Yeah. Arman: For a long time, that's a slow. Now it doesn't mean that they don't need to continue to acquire IP. That is an absolutely important aspect of the business, both through these upfront as well as through purchase of catalog. In the case of Dylan, it's probably worth starting with the idea that competition for this is increasing materially over the last handful of years. Hypnosis is probably the most well known competitor who's essentially created a fund to go purchase catalog. Blackstone recently announced partnership with them on that. By the way, if we just step way, way back, that's a pretty good indication that people think the value of these assets are growing over time, not shrinking and so increased interest in- Patrick: More supply of capital. Yeah. Arman: Yeah. I do think to the extent capital is flowing anywhere today, the fact that this happens to be a category where we're seeing enormous interest is probably a sign that people at least think this is an interesting category to be looking at. In terms of the ROI calculation, by the way, we should just touch on content investment at UMG particularly, but as we just talked about the industry overall has increased substantially over the last handful of years and net IP spend, net content acquisition costs at UMG were near 0, six, seven years ago to maybe a couple hundred million, three, four years ago to like 500 million, two years ago, to like one and a half billion last year. Of the one and half billion, half billion was Dylan. And also we had Taylor in there and some of the inflation is Prince sold part of his estate sold or that catalog to UMG.And so part of that inflation is we've seen this dynamic forming where artists later in their careers or their estates have either a differentiated view or just cashing out now, because we've seen after 15 years in the desert, we've come back to real value starting to accrue again to these assets. And some people are saying, great for you labels that you think it's going to keep going up and to the right, but we're happy to just take our cash today and walk away. So you've seen more assets kind of really start to change hands in substantial ways than historically. But the core proposition is for our catalog purchase is I think streaming and all these other ancillary things we talked about, whether it's Peloton or Roblox or social media is going to continue to drive increased monetization of this content. I think this has a X decade life left to it.I think that we are moving from a model where 90% of the income for a song was generating the first 24 months after release to one whereas the average age of the streamer continues to mature, catalog content becomes more valuable because my consumption of older music goes up as a streaming platform and that monetization goes up as a result, that maybe as the streaming services stop competing with each other as that growth rate matures, do we start to see just their average realized prices approach headline prices as opposed to their current significant discounts to headline prices, because they're just in a market share war right now. The labels and the hypnosis of the world belief is all of those drivers are going to continue to improve the monetization of this content. We think we can put a number around what we think that's going to be. We can discount it at x-rate.And we think that this is what we should pay for that content today. And by the way, if you come into our ecosystem as opposed to going to hypnosis', we have a whole marketing operation for artists. We can actually market catalog, just like we can market artist product. Look at the scale advantages we have. We can generate more revenue and more profit from every piece of IP that we acquire than just a pure financial investor. From a catalog perspective, that's the calculus. For the upfront perspective, it's slightly different which is what do I think the hit rate on this portfolio of artists is going to be? And that's what I was talking about a little bit earlier, where they are making the decision to say we are going to pay higher up fronts because we think the hit rate on our portfolio is going to go up because instead of signing an artist who played a bunch of songs out of a van, a bunch of local bars in Boston, I'm going to try to take him or her national.Now you're say, you're picking up an artist where the artist says I've already released three albums. I have a hundred thousand followers on Facebook, which 10,000 are in Germany. And here is my demographics. And here's the new product . That is a sure bet for a label to make. And so we are seeing them willing to pay more upfront for that content, partly because they should. I mean the artist has something that they can show in the form of a track record.But if the hit rate on that portfolio goes up as a result of that, even though the denominator is going up a lot, hopefully the numerator is too and so your ROI in that investment isn't collapsing to the rate that some people I think are worried about in this industry. Yes, it's becoming more capital intensive in some ways. First of all, the majority of capital content and acquisition at UMG and most of the industry goes towards catalog, not towards the upfronts and then within the upfront element of it, I do think there's this argument to be made that hit rates are going to improve because data analytics is improving then, yeah, okay, you pay a little bit more for the rights, but the rights are A, worth more because the value of IP is going up and B, my hit rate in the portfolio is going to go up too and so I'm not saying the ROI is going to go up, but I don't think it's collapsing to the rate many people in the industry fear.",1621
343,Arman Gokgol-Kline - Universal Music Group: The Gatekeepers of Music,"Growth, Risks, and Choosing a Label"," Patrick: You've got this fascinating dynamic of the catalog driving so much of this discussion, the value inherent in that thing, potentially growing, like more and more leverage on IP assets, historically, that have a cultural cache or Dylan's songs that everyone recognizes or whatever. It feels like the position of the businesses themselves is fairly steady, which is good in the sense that, like you said, even if they stopped all activities, they're going to have a lot of value for a long time, but it also makes me think that achieving crazy high growth rates is also really hard because there's only so much IP to go around and if that's driving everything, it's equally hard to imagine 100% year over year growth as it is, 50% decline or something. How do you think about that, like the growth profile of these businesses going forward as an investor? Arman: What's driven the growth of this industry for the last five to 10 years is this emergence of streaming. We just talked about how it's more than half the business today. It was single digit seven years ago and so that's just been rapid. All of the growth of the value of streaming has basically come from a few developed markets, historic markets that already monetized, that have quickly adopted to this model. To me the idea that those are maturing and slowing is obvious. They talk about how over 70% of households in Sweden, Spotify's home market, pay for streaming. In the UK it's in the 60s, in the US it's in the upper 50s, so these are somewhat mature and maturing markets, but that part of the growth story to some aspect is going to slow. Now, as I said, I don't think it's just a subscriber growth story. I do think there's going to be a conversation as this market matures around, once the market share war has done what it's going to do, are we going to see streaming platforms start to discount less, which alone would improve monetization notably. We're not talking about 5% or 10% discount, we're talking about pretty significant discounting that occurs right now in this industry, so that pricing would certainly improve.The real opportunity on streaming is this concept of, are we going to finally see this become a more normal content market, where it's not just five markets that drive all the revenue and all the profit? Are we going to start to see the China's of the world, the India's of the world and China's an exception for the labels, but are we going to see the eastern Europe, are we going to see Australia? Are we going to see some of these markets start to monetize in a way that the 75% of revenue that came from the top five, five years ago to the high 60s today, is going to go to 60, 55, 50, 45 and all of a sudden you're going to start to see real monetization occur? If you talk to most people in the industry, I think you would hear that is what they are most excited about and that's why they believe you're going to continue to see significant growth in this category.Beyond that is the question of these new channels that are emerging. I think that's a harder one to handicap. It's easy to look at that and say, you've already signed up Roblox, you've already signed up Peloton, what more is there left? To me, that analysis misses the nuance, which is, we're getting to the point where music is becoming more ubiquitous. People are consuming more music. Just as an interesting stat, in the US the average person five years ago was consuming about 25 hours of music a week. That's up to 32 hours now with streaming because the incremental cost to consume has just gone to zero, so I'll just consume more music.By the way, things like smart speakers are showing up. Well, 50% of people who have bought a smart speakers say they listened to more music than they did prior to buying smart speaker. We are seeing music show up everywhere in our lives and we're now having a model where we can monetize that music and we can even talk about blockchain and NFTs and all these other ways that we could potentially monetize it even more and in different ways. That's where I think you start to see some upside to the growth rates of this maturing core streaming that we've seen. I know the industry certainly is focused on those and thinks that there's opportunity there as well. While I certainly agree that it's hard to see how things grow 50 or a hundred percent a year, I think the idea that the high single digit to load teens growth that they're talking about, I think the duration of that growth may be longer than people appreciate because you can look at the core streaming and say, well, it was like 40% growth a handful of years ago and it's more like 15 to 20% now. That's just going to five to 10 at some point then that's it, misses those other nuances about these other markets that potentially develop and you see that high single digit, low teens, maybe persist for quite a long period of time.Growth is also going to persist at recent rates for a bit longer for the majors because the percentage of their business coming from growing channels like streaming is now significant, versus over the last five years growth from streaming was to a large extent being offset by declining businesses, particularly digital direct, that iTunes business we talked about and to a lesser extent, physical. Patrick: If you think about the market expansion and the modality expansion in the growth equation, the two things that matter the most, what counterbalances that on the risk side? If you had to assess the things that, if you're the CEO of UMG or Sony or whatever, are most terrifying to you, is it NFTs? Is it new ways that allow power to shift more towards the artists because the top of funnel becomes less interesting and the super fan becomes more important to the monetization of IP for artists? Arman: Yeah, I think this industry certainly has challenges. It's dynamic. Things are changing. Now, I will say the major labels and I happen to think UMG is the best at this, have reacted pretty well. Just before I get into some of the other risks. One risk was over the last five years, you saw technology players, tech forward, skinny labels as they call themselves, emerge to try to disrupt the major labels, whether that was a Distrokid at the low end or an Orchard or Grooves in the mid segment or Believe Digital. They were trying to say, hey, we can use technology to do like 80%, 70%, 50% of what a label can. You can keep your IP rights and that's a way better consumer proposition for you.I think not only has the fact that everybody wants to be a superstar and the fact that's actually where all the economics in the industry tend to go. I'm trying to remember the stats here, but I think it's that of the top 57,000 artists in the market, 47,000 make less than a hundred thousand a year. The economics vastly favor the toped end of this thing. Everyone has to become a superstar, not just for ego reasons, but for monetary reasons as well. You've seen companies like Sony and UMG do is, they said, we can create a competitor to the Tubecore and the DistroKids and we can go purchase the In Grooves and the Orchards and the AWALs from Kobalt and we can basically say, hey, we can do all that too. Oh and by the way, if you're in our ecosystem, the chance of you coming up to our superstar label is higher as well, so it come to us. They've done a really nice job with that.I agree, NFTs and blockchains. I think of them as both a risk and an opportunity. Maybe I'll start with NFTs. On the opportunity side, NFTs could unlock special album incentives. You could get access to certain live stream. You can get limited edition albums. That's an interesting kind idea of incremental revenue for these players, but a key role for, as we've talked about, for these labels, is also this VC element to it. Imagine if I was a mid-tier artist and I said, well, I can either go sign on with a major label and get my million dollars and get my shot at stardom or I can actually get close to a million dollars by creating content and selling it as an NFT to my fans and saying, okay, I'm going to still give away the rights, but I'm going to give it to my fans, not to these labels who I'd rather not work with. Now, there are still elements of, that's great, but you're now a small fish in a very, very big, increasingly crowded ocean and some of these challenges, but there's no doubt that NFT model could allow artists to generate upfront revenue from content in a way that was near impossible for them to do before.Blockchain, similarly. On the one hand the ability to track content around the world as it's consumed, the ability to track data, garner data from that around the world, that's certainly an exciting proposition for these labels. As we talked about briefly earlier, the publishing part of this business, which is still a teens part of revenue and profits, their core function is to go track down usage of the content and get paid for it. Well, a blockchain does that for you just using good old fashioned cheap technology. I think there is a challenge to the industry, the publishing side of the business, around technology. I would say the labels because of their catalog and their relationships are very well placed to drive that adoption of blockchain in the industry, but this old world of just having these high fixed costs to go try to track down every time someone use just something, turning into a simple thing where every time someone consumes a piece of digital music you know exactly who did it and when and how often, certainly changes the dynamic there on the publishing side of the business. At least on the margin side, probably, if not on the revenue side. I think of the technology in general, as being a risk that they need to navigate. I think they're well positioned to, but they still need to navigate it.Then two we've already talked about is content, hyperinflation, arguably and content we're seeing as more and more money A becomes available and B goes towards this category. Now, as we talked about, I don't think that necessarily means lower ROIs, but it certainly doesn't mean higher and it's a challenge. They are making more investments. As gatekeepers, the ROI was a pretty simple proposition. Now it's becoming more about more money's chasing this, so I just have to out execute other people and be able to generate more revenue from the same piece of IP than the next guy or a girl can because if I can't then I will have a return that's probably going to come down over time.Those are the two certainly biggest elements that I worry about. Three is just how much penetration we're likely to see in streaming generally. Yes, the top markets that have adopted streaming are in the 50, 60, 70% of households range. By the way, the US going from 60 to 70 is still a nice driver of growth, but on average, developed markets are between 20 and 30, once you take the biggest ones out and the developing world is single digits. That really needs to happen for you to see a more exciting growth trajectory than one where it's maturing and you're a little bit more dependent on the revenue side of the equation. Can the ARPUs start to improve because a discounting goes down to core markets. That's certainly another aspect of risk that I think is front and center for the industry and one that they are still struggling with.Lastly and this I put as a tail risk that's hard to know, is regulatory. As I mentioned, the UK has now a parliamentary commission looking into how IP is split between the labels and the artists. I think it's a pretty nuanced discussion, unfortunately. It's about the person who owns the IP. Because it's such a risk, the IP, in the early days, how much do you pay for that? I actually think laws that would force the IP to revert quickly or from day one in a 50/50 way towards the artist, would just lead to less money going to the industry, which I'm not sure is good for artists, actually. It's just going to reduce number of people who can take shots on goal and that's going to not be positive, that's going to be negative. I actually think what'll happen is you'll see the biggest current artists just start to grab more of the market because they'll have all these machines going after just what they have, as opposed to wanting to invest in new. Patrick: So much of this comes back to that funny thing you said where, raise your hand if you think the labels are good and no one raises their hand and raise your hand if you want to work with them and everyone raises their hand. The question then is, how do I decide between the value prop of a UMG versus a Sony versus something else? What are the competitive dynamics there in the oligopoly? If I'm a great artist or even an up and coming one, what do you think drives their decisions? Maybe this is the time to talk about how they treat their artists. There's been some checkered stories there, historically and the ESG attention on every company is going to probably affect the labels too and how they treat their talent and think about things like diversity. This is the last aspect to bring us home. We've established these players matter. Contrary to the narrative, this isn't just a technology story, it's an IP rights story and a distribution story and all these other things. How do I pick between labels? We haven't talked at all about labels underneath UMG that have their own distinct brands that people probably don't even know are part of UMG. Just walk us through this last leg of the process. Arman: In terms of the competitive advantage, what UMG and to your point, no one is going to sign with UMG. They're going to go sign with one of their sub labels, which are with the labels that are known in the industry and they tend to be focused on a specific genre of music or a specific geography of music, but what UMG says, to anyone that walks in is nine of the top 10 songs on Spotify and 14 of the top 20 were my artists. 60% of the top 50 streaming artists on Spotify are my artists. To the extent you want a big major scale player, you're looking at. They're the company that can do that for you and so that is, certainly I think, the headline pitch.Two, they would say, hey, by the way, we've invested in technology and Lucian Grainge, who's the CEO of Universal Music, is I think recognized as the best executive in the industry. He just won a bunch of awards. I think Billboard named him their first ever executive of the decade. He came up through both publishing and A&R. He was very forward amongst the majors to understand that technology and streaming was going to change the industry and invested ahead of the others, certainly not as fast as some people would've liked, but invested quickly to adopt the business towards data and towards technology. He started Spin Up, which is a competitor to the TuneCore and the DistroKids. He went and bought Ingrooves. You've seen him look forward. I think step two for them is they would say, by the way, we are adapting to the new world. Look at what our capabilities are. We can take you artists, that's just going to record his or her first song in a garage, all the way through your journey in a way that no individual disruptor or no individual other major label can.Warner has a nice competitor that they've started up to TuneCore and DistroKid, who doesn't have that quite strong midsection yet. Sony with Kobalt AWAL and the Orchard has a nice midsection, but maybe not as strong on it. When you get the scale and you get that forward looking, hey, I can create services that the disruptors are, that makes it easier to say, oh, I'm going with someone who's already looking around the corner at all of that. Three because of your size, I've talked about sizes of data advantage in this business. Again, given the size I just told you about in stream, which is the number one driver data, they just have a data advantage in many ways that it's hard for other to replicate. They are the number one label in more markets than any other label out there and so to the extent they are going and having conversations with people in individual markets about data flowing back to them, they are getting listened to more often and they are getting more out of those negotiations than others are.When you combine the best ecosystem, the best artists, the best catalog, with the most money to then reinvest back into the ecosystem because of their scale, to the scale advantages around data, you start to see a pretty notable advantage, even amongst the big three, emerge. Patrick: Any thoughts on this concept of diversity and the treatment of artists and how this plays a role in the world of music? Arman: It's sad in a way. I think you had an industry because they were gatekeepers, they didn't care about anything, for so long. I don't know that they've necessarily been fully humbled yet and so you see these stories come out about, both the cultures within these companies, as well as how artists feel like they're being treated. Now I think part of that is they feel it's unfair that they have to give up economics. The failed artist is never going to complain about how they got a million dollars upfront and only earn 400,000 back and that was really unfair and the winning artist is going to complain they got a million dollars up front for generating a hundred million of revenue for the label and that's completely unfair.I do think there's a little bit of positioning there, so it's not quite as simple a conversation as some people make it out to be, but certainly UMG and the others have talked about this and they should be, which is, there is still a lot to do around making labels more appealing to work with. You don't want to give people an excuse for not wanting to work with you. When that professor walks into that classroom at Berkeley College of music, it should bother executives in this industry that 100% of people raise their hand and say, I don't really want to ever work with a label if I don't have to. That's a problem. They need to resolve that. Patrick: What a completely fascinating industry. I feel like we've really thoroughly explored the levers and variables that matter, the history, the amazing peak in the late '90s now roaring back, thanks to all the dynamics you've explained. Anything that we've missed that you think is a, if not key, super interesting aspect of UMG the business, music, the industry, more generally? Arman: The one aspect that we touched on, that's probably just worth underlining here, is that we are seeing the consumption of music increase pretty materially. Today, 90% of Americans, according to a Nielsen report, say that they listen to music at least once a week. 50% say they listen to music at least daily. For TV, only about two thirds watch TV once a week. It's even less for video games. This is just a widely consumed product, that is very important to a lot of people. Another study I read said 50% of Americans would say music is very important in their lives, they can't imagine not having it. That's a lot of people.As I said to you, as we start to see smart cars, to smart speakers, the metaverse, as the Roblox case emerge, you're getting more and more use cases for this very important piece of IP to come up and we're seeing more and more people consume more and more of it. That increase in the number of people, hours that people are consuming, 23 hours or so in 2015, going to 32 hours last year in a week, that's a substantial increase if you think about it. For a product that's been around forever a day, but turns out when you remove the barriers to incremental consumption and you make it available in more places, people actually want to consume this. Remember, it's coming back to, what's the real value of the IP that we're even talking about here? It's clearly valuable IP. Patrick: Well, it's a very perfect spot to end the conversation. I feel like you could go do one of these dives on, we didn't even talk about title or some of these other interesting things going on in the ecosystem, but just an incredible overview. Makes me want to go listen to a playlist or two. Thank you as always, so much for your time. Arman: Thanks Pat.This site uses cookies to improve your browsing experience.

Alex has a long history in FinTech, having co-founded six companies in his career, including Affirm and TrialPay. During our conversation, we cover Alex's framework for positive selection in investing, why the best investments are often operating system or systems of record, and Alex's views on the future of FinTech. For those that have listened to our Business Breakdown on Visa with Alex, you know the intellectual horsepower that he brings to every conversation and this conversation is no exception. Please enjoy my great conversation with Alex Rampell.",137
345,Alex Rampell - Investing in Operating Systems,Lean into Positive Selection," Patrick: So Alex, where the hell to begin this conversation? There's going to be so many avenues we're going to go down. Maybe I'll start with a really simple concept I've seen you put out there. You call it the rules of investing. Rule number one is lean into positive selection and avoid adverse selection. Rule number two is just to see rule number one, so let's zoom in on rule number one. What do you mean by this big overarching idea? Alex: Well, I think it's particularly relevant for venture capital, because if you think about the world as a two by two matrix, there's consensus and non-consensus and then there's right and wrong. And if you're in the wrong part, if you're in the wrong column, you can never make money as an investor. By definition, this is the post-facto outcome. You were wrong. You can't actually do well. The company that you invested in went bankrupt or lost to their eight competitors or whatever the case may be. But in public markets, you typically want to be non-consensus and right because obviously, you have to be right to actually make money. But if you're consensus right, then that's probably not that interesting. Whereas in venture capital, it turns out being consensus right is probably even better than being non-consensus right, because the challenge with being non-consensus right...Again, you have to be right because if you're wrong, not going to work. But the challenge with being non-consensus right is if you think, ""Okay, this is a very, very interesting field. It's going to require a hundred million dollars of capital for this business to actually get to the promised land and get enough customers and get enough revenue and get enough scale. I'm going to invest in their $10 million Series A, which means they're going to eventually need to raise another $90 million in many successive rounds."" And this is a crazy, crazy idea that nobody except for me on planet earth believes in. Well, then who's going to lead the Series B? This is the challenge. So it's fine if you're a non-consensus and then it trends towards consensus, but if the investment is non-consensus long enough, that's actually great for public markets, typically. It's not great for the private markets because you tend to need somebody else to believe and actually coalesce around what is your consensus.And the other reason why public and private are just so different is there's no concept of winning a deal in the public markets. You go to your interactive broker's account or E-Trade or whatever and you enter in your order. You place a market order. You place a limit order. You place a stock order, whatever kind of order you place. You will get filled if you hit the ask. Whereas on the private side, a lot of times, there will be a company, it will only talk to five investors. You have to be in those five investors to be in the consideration set. If you're the only one that's actually bidding, again, that's bad. That's a sign of adverse selection potentially, because it's the old Groucho Marx saying, if you wouldn't want to join a club that would have you as a member, so you want to make sure that this is actually a hard to win deal, but then it typically is not about paying the highest price.Because if it was paying the highest price, it wouldn't be open to only five firms or ten firms. It's just not as efficient of a market as the public markets. And in some cases, it's not necessarily unfair. If you're a private company and you want to fundraise in two days and you don't want to leak your financials to potentially 10,000 investors that might tell all of your competitors, well of course, you want to actually tighten the circle and only talk to five firms. So the job is, again, to be one of those five firms. And it's actually a great sign that those other four firms are highly, highly interested. It's a great sign if you have to pay a much, much higher price than you would like, because it actually shows that there's some element you might not be right. Right, wrong, not clear at that point, but there's a heuristic, which is the fundraising acumen of the founder.So I often say that the best founders can materialize labor and capital and the ones that are really, really good at materializing capital, again, it just shows that there's a higher probability of the company getting sufficient funding to cross that chasm and get to profitability or get to sufficient scale. And that's the high level of where I think about adverse selection. It's the value investing trap has been very, very challenging in the public markets. If you followed value investing for the last 10, 15, probably 20 years, it's even more problematic in the private markets because value investing means that something is wrong with the company. That's why you're getting a cheap price. And it's very, very hard to turn a company around. It happens from time to time, but once you've lost your mojo and once you've lost your market cap, it's very, very tough to turn that around because you have to pay people well. How do you do that if you have less money, if you have less market cap, again, private or public? So lean in to positive selection, avoid adverse selection. That is definitely a good rule to live by. Patrick: What do you think will happen in terms of capital formation and methods or technologies of capital formation in the private markets, especially early stage over the next 10 to 20 years? It seems like the prices, even though they seem really high, if it was just a pure open market and the most savvy storytellers could crowdfund their rounds or something, you can imagine prices that would get just ridiculous. What do you think might happen under those scenarios? Will we see anything like that? What are your thoughts on just more capital formation at the earliest stages? Alex: The answer is actually maybe. There have been plenty of times throughout recent history, where private markets are ahead of public markets. Now, why would private prices be ahead of public prices? Well, there are a couple of reasons for that. One is that you can't shorten the private market, so there's no selling of something that you believe to be overvalued. You just can't really make that bed. But the other reason is by actually constricting the number of bidders, the bidders don't really know that they're overpaying, potentially. Whereas public markets, you'll get a sense like, ""Okay, here's a company that wants to go do a secondary offering once public."" There's already an auction that's being conducted every nanosecond that gives a sense of what the price of the security should be and you don't really have that in the private market. So there certainly is this capability for private markets to actually get ahead of public markets with a subset of the bidders that might exist on the public markets.But I really love what this company Carta is doing because right now, you have this binary thing and normally, binary distinctions don't make sense if you can have many, many different shades of gray. You're either a public company or a private company. A lot of the value accretion has been in private markets, I think often to the unfairness of the retail investor or public market investors, because look at Amazon when they went public more than 20 years ago. I think it went public at a $550 million market cap or something very, very small like that. Patrick: Yeah, it was under a billion for sure. Alex: Yes, under a billion dollars was potentially a lot more money back then, just with inflation and whatnot. I'm not talking CPI inflation, but asset inflation . Patrick: Real inflation. Alex: Yeah exactly, real inflation of real assets, which has been pretty crazy of late. The vast majority of so many companies' appreciation was in the public markets. Facebook went public at a hundred billion dollar market cap. And granted, Facebook is worth almost a trillion dollars now, so there's been more net dollar accretion that way. But the idea that the public markets could actually participate in a lot of the upside and to your point, it should, over the long run, actually results in lower cost of capital for companies, which is a great thing for innovation and entrepreneurship. Because if you have this cartel of five investors that just do late stage deals, well, over time, they're trying to arbitrage between public markets and private markets, which this was the way that a lot of late stage funds would make money for a very, very long time, is that they knew there was a liquidity premium and an illiquidity discount and that's what they would trade on.Another thing that I like to say a lot is that, and this is maybe a controversial statement so feel free to call me out on it, but there's no such thing as an equity. There's only a bond and a call option. And a lot of what private markets invest in, in particular, are out of the money call options. All these call options are not in the money or at the money. They're very, very distinctively out of the money because how is a company that has two people in a garage and a PowerPoint presentation, how in the world is that worth a hundred million dollars? And it's funny. My father, he's an accountant. I often joke with him that when I talked to him about these things, it's almost like Bud Fox talking to his father in that movie Wall Street, where Bud Fox is making money on these very fast and loose things. And my dad's like, ""When do these companies make a profit?What about their profit? What about their profit?"" I was like, ""No, you have to understand these companies, it's best at some point in time, they might be Facebook."" So you're effectively betting on this is a very, very out of the money call option. If everything works perfectly, then it's potentially the next Facebook. It's potentially the next Apple and Apple looks more like a bond. Apple's not an expensive company. Facebook's not an expensive company, relative to everything else out there, because they're no longer out of the money. But the vast majority of things early stage are out of the money. I know I'm jumping around a little bit here, but the reason why I like something like Carta, which is where I started this little monologue with, is they hopefully are enabling an exchange for people to invest in private markets so that you're not... On day one, doesn't make sense for your shares to be traded on NASDAQ and for you to put out quarterly reports when you have a product that doesn't even exist yet. Nobody uses it. You don't have a finance department and being Sarbanes-Oxley compliant doesn't really make any sense.Well, of course not. But a year before you go public, doesn't make sense to only have trading in your stock, I don't know, once every year and a half, haphazardly with only two firms that have a right of first refusal on your private securities, well, that probably doesn't make sense either. What Carta has done is effectively, they are the cap table management software for almost every single private company out there. And now they're enabling trading of those private securities with, again, not all of retail because you still have these accredited investor and qualified purchaser rules and a lot of other things that I think are rather anachronistic and should not exist, but that's a different topic. But they're blending the lines between private and public, which I think is the net great thing. Because actually when a company goes public, what should the reference price of its shares be? Well, it's really hard to tell because a trade spawns once a year. It's not even trading.The way around and there's somebody who's buying it out of the money call option at that point. So it's a much better idea to have a regular process and to have a non-binary process of that, which is you're not private for nine years and then boom, suddenly you're public and you have more shares traded in the first hour than your entire life as a company. No, transition to maybe you trade once a quarter. Maybe you trade once a month. You let more people on your cap table and hopefully the SCC loosens restraints around who can and cannot invest in private companies, not because I want people's grandmothers taking on more risks, but it's actually fundamentally unfair, from my perspective, that the value accretion goes to rich people that passed these accredited investor questionnaires.",2765
346,Alex Rampell - Investing in Operating Systems,"Think in Terms of Bonds and Call Options, Not Equity"," Patrick: If we dig in a little bit more on the there is no equity, there's only bonds and call options, how is that idea useful? It's a fun thing to play with and it makes me think maybe of something like Amazon, where in the peak of Amazon's reinvestment story, maybe over the last five years, that would be an example of a stock that I would have a really hard time parsing into bond because there is no bond. There's no real profits to speak of relative to its revenue. And it's reinvesting heavily, but it's also very much a thing. AWS doesn't feel like a call option. It's working. It's growing incredibly fast, even five years ago. So how did you come to this idea? Why do you think it's useful for investors out there to think in these terms? Alex: Well, I mean, particularly for private companies, where it's the only way to really think about it, you're always taking a bet on the future of what if things go right? That's the fun thing about private markets, which is what you can lose one times your money that's capped. But if things really, really work, I mean, you could make 10,000, a hundred thousand, there's unlimited upside. But how do you try to quantify that upside? And a lot of the ways that we try to do it, we know it's false precision. Whereas if we say, ""Okay, here's a company that's two days old. In year nine, we believe they will have $14.3 billion of EBITDA. Of course, that's going to be wrong, but you try to look at what they're building, not what is the total addressable market for that product or service as it stands today. It's an out of the money thing, which is, if you think that the world is going in this particular direction, then let's think about what that looks like at year five and year seven.Wow, that's a really, really big opportunity. So yeah, we're going to say that this two people in a garage with a very, very fancy PowerPoint presentation, we're going to call that worth $40 million or whatever the number is that the investors will put on it. But if that works and we own 20% of it and we get diluted over time, this could be a massive, massive market. We have to think about things in those terms because there are no profits. I mean, they're just two people in a garage, never have profits definitionally so. I think for public markets, I mean, you could probably use the same framework, which is if every company is worth the present value of future profits, just almost objectively speaking, if you were going to go take a company private that's currently public, that's how you would have to value it to make your debt service and whatnot, so it turns out that the long tail of those profits is really what you care about. The discount that you apply to them is very, very high.But if this thing is not working yet, but you think it's going to work and be big in the future, then not really thinking about what year five looks like is probably not very smart. A lot of smart investors that I talked to, it's almost like Seth Klarman has the famous Margin of Safety book, which is out of print. It's like the original NFT. It's very hard to get. But effectively, what you can do, again, with false precision, is you can try to apply a margin of safety to a wild, almost hyperbolic guess of if this thing really works, I'm going to invest in things that I think fundamentally can change the world. If they can fundamentally change the world in year five, I mean, any price that I pay today is effectively undervaluing this company relative to where it is in year five or year 10.Otherwise, I wouldn't be buying this out of the money call option. But I'm getting a margin of safety, if you will, of I'm only investing in things that I think can change the world that can be massive, massive, massive companies in year 5 or year 10. What's a fair discount? What's the margin of safety that I can get in year 10 if that thing happens? And again, it's binary at that point. Either they succeed in that or they don't. If they do, then you're getting something very, very cheap. So if you invest in AWS or if you invest in Amazon when they first announce AWS and it's like, ""Wow, actually I think the entire world is going to be cloud."" Let me fast forward in 10 years at this company. Amazon gets 25% of the cloud market. Now, again, false precision. Are you going to get the exact size of the market? No, but you could almost apply a margin of safety there in that year 10.That's one way I think of coming up with a framework, which again, you have to have enough shots on goal to make this work. I mean, this is where the best venture firms, they'll have concentrated bets, but you're never going to put a hundred percent of your fund, I would argue, into one highly, highly speculative thing. It probably won't work. That's an out of the money call option. You're probably hoping to say, ""I'm going to invest in 10 things or 15 things or 20 things, or maybe 30 things that all have this chance of being completely revolutionary, world changing."" I like hanging out sometimes with other VCs because they tend to be very optimistic, in many cases overly so, around what can be world changing to what extent. Most of the time we're wrong, like any other human, but if you get it right, that's where, again, the out of the money call option that you're getting is it turns out at the time to be very, very, fairly struck that in fact, unfairly struck in your favor because the upside is so big.",1282
347,Alex Rampell - Investing in Operating Systems,Searching for Operating Systems," Patrick: Peter Thiel has this awesome definition of technology, which is really simple, which is just to do more with less. So this tool of leverage that creates for possibility and maybe therefore world-changing, to use your term. And one fun way I've heard you describe what you're trying to do with your investing is that you're hunting for operating systems, which are the ultimate form of technology leverage, if you will. Can you talk through this investment concept, what you mean by searching for operating systems as companies. And maybe we can go into as much detail as you're able on this really interesting concept. Alex: My absolute favorite companies or businesses to invest in are ones that I think have an operating system like Mechanic. And that doesn't mean that it's Windows or Mac OS, but it has the same concept, which is if you ever go to a dentist or any modern dentist, I should say, almost every dentist in the country runs something called a DPM, a dental practice management software product. And that keeps track of all of the customers. It keeps track of the pictures of all of the customers' teeth. And there are a number of companies that make them. Actually, one of the early ones was Henry Schein, which actually makes dental equipment, but turned out to get into the dental software space. But the retention rate of these products is basically a hundred percent. It's a product that if you are the receptionist at a dental office or even the dentist himself or herself, you're logging into this product every single day to check pictures of the teeth, to check when the next person's appointment is, to check your outstanding billings, to go charge customers credit card. So it is the system of truth.And when I say operating system, it actually means two things. It means system of truth. So it keeps track of everything at a company or even for a consumer, and I'll talk about that a little bit later. It has very, very high utilization and usage. So it is this canonical, in consumer terms you would call it a DAU, a daily active use product or weekly active used product, because in the long run, what really matters the most, you could show evidence of a mode if you have a product that people use every single day and the margins that you're able to extract from the product that you sell to these customers that use it every day, are maintained or even increased over time. So an operating system is basically something that runs the business, it is the system of truth, so it keeps track of what inventory you have, what your sales receipts are, how much you have in sales tax, all of these things. And the reason why that's so valuable is because even though there is this kind of concept, the much valued concept of the App Store, you can start adding other things into that operating system.So what does that mean? If you're a dentist, you want to offer installment payments for the crown or cavity that that patient needs. It's very easy, and you actually have free distribution of that new product if you are the operating system, versus what I would say, the very, very uphill battle of, ""I am just a financing company that offers financing for cavities and crowns. Now I got to go find every dentist. I got to sign them up. The person that I signed up that works at the dental office might leave one month later, then I got to sign them up again. Then after I've signed them up, I have to hopefully count on the fact that they're going to market this or push this in front of their patients, but they probably won't do, so I have to re-market to them."" Again, versus the operating system where it's the system of truth. There are operating systems for a lot of businesses like Toast, which went public recently. That's an operating system for restaurants. They don't just do payment processing. Like a lot of people think of it as like, ""Oh, like I paid for my bill at the restaurant with Toast."" Well, Toast actually does payroll for the people that work at the restaurant.They have tablets that go to the kitchen. So when the waiter or waitress goes and enters your hamburger order, it shows up immediately at the tablet at the kitchen. So it's basically like a custom built piece of software that runs the business. And it will even keep track of how many hamburger patties are in the back kitchen as well. So these operating systems, they really retain customers extraordinarily well. And they are very adept. There's a lot of what I would say out of the money call option value, if you will, of them being able to position other products and services to either the end customers, like the customer's customers, or the customer itself. I actually wrote a blog post on this when I first joined this firm Andreessen Horowitz, which was my key learning, I called this the TiVo problem. This was at my company trial pay which I sold to Visa. So the TiVo problem, I call this, which is in 1998 TiVo and this other company called ReplayTV invented this amazing technology, at least amazing for people that were around it in 1998 like I was, that allowed you to pause live television. And TiVo was a very, very popular thing in the late nineties.But today in 2021, it's basically a patent troll rate. It was sold to another company which is effectively a patent troll that just sues other companies. I would never want to be in that position and I don't have a lot of high regard for companies that do that. But the reason why that actually happened was TiVo did not control the distribution. They have this great product, but TiVo was not valuable if you just had a TV set and you lived in Antarctica. It only had value if you had Comcast, or if you had DirectTV. You need a TV to go. You need an actual television content to go into that TV, and then you would have live content to pause, hence TiVo. And I think the problem is that if you build an amazing, amazing innovation, and this is outside of the Clay Christiansen framework of disruptive versus sustaining innovations, it really is, ""Do you control the distribution or not?""So, Comcast has that pipe into your house. I think the problem is if you build TiVo, which is an amazing world changing thing, it's not a sustaining innovation, it's an amazing thing. But the problem is you have three outcomes that will eventually happen. Number one is Comcast says, ""You know what? We should buy you. You're an amazing company."" But if Comcast goes and buys TiVo, then what about Time Warner Cable and DirecTV? They're going to say, ""Hey, we're not going to sell TiVo anymore. It's owned by our competitor."" So you have this weird case in M & A where you can have not a control premium, which is a term often used where you're paying more per share for the entire thing then you would for the marginal share. You're going to have a control discount because TiVo is going to lose a huge chunk of their sales from the competitor. So that's option one. Option two is that Comcast says, ""Hey, you know what, let's partner because we're the ones that have the pipes into all the homes. We're going to take 99 cents on the dollar. And you're going to take 1 cent on the dollar."" And TiVo's like, ""Well, that's not fair. I want a better deal than that.""They're like, ""Yeah, well screw you. We're just going to go with ReplayTV."" So you don't really have that much leverage in a negotiation vis-a-vis the distributor. And then option number three is basically Comcast says, ""That's a nice little tool that you have there. We're just going to go hire Accenture. I don't know, some consulting firm or a bunch of engineers to go build a crappy version of the same thing."" And basically the problem is that one of those three options always happens to the TiVo, the metaphorical TiVo in this example, which is you build this amazing thing, it changes the world, you don't control the distribution, unfortunately, and you either get copied, you get bought in an unfair price, or you get a partnership agreement which is really tilted out of your favor. So the lesson is, I mean, it sounds crazy to give this to an entrepreneur or a true innovator who's like, ""Don't build TiVo, build Comcast."" Because if you build Comcast and you have a good product and engineering team, or you can actually create stuff, you have unlimited option value to go rollout TiVo, to charge more for TiVo, and so on and so forth.Whereas if you're TiVo, you're kind of at the mercy of Comcast and you might get lucky, you probably won't be. And 20 years later, you might get patent troll. And that's kind of how I got to the operating system thesis to begin with, which is you want to look like Comcast. What does that mean? You want to be the pipes that actually control the backend of the business, because if you do that, and ideally even the front end. If you do that, you could be a body shop. Body shops should run on body shop software. Who's going to build that software? Well, they're going to have perpetual rights to offer, cross sell of whatever body shops need, whatever the customers of body shops need and so on and so forth. Or, you've got this whole other category of what I would call horizontal operating systems. QuickBooks is effectively an operating system. They do one thing for lots of types of businesses, which is the backend accounting. Or Square is a kind of operating system for lots and lots of businesses in a very horizontal way.I use horizontal and vertical. As vertical is like focusing on one particular trant of business. It's like Toast is a vertically focused operating system for restaurants, full stop. Square does that too, but it's not as customized for restaurants, which is why Toast was able to steal a lot. But both of them effectively are operating systems. How do you know if it's an operating system or not? I think this was a Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart said, ""How do you know if something is pornography?"" And he said, ""I'll know it when I see it."" How do you know if something is an operating system? And I'll say, ""I'll know it when I see it."" But really it's like, ""Is this thing the permanent system of record that stores all customer business interactions and is it used almost every single day?"" And if the answer is, ""yes,"" it's probably an operating system. If the answer is, ""yes,"" there's almost this permanent up-sell capability where if you have, again, if you have a great management team, there are so many things that they can do with this.Facebook is kind of an operating system for human interaction. That's maybe a little bit of a stretch because there are plenty of ways of operating outside of Facebook. But what other products and features has Facebook added over the last 15 years? It's really remarkable. So much of their business growth has been from that. Because again, they had very high retention, people use the thing almost every single day, and therefore there was a lot, like if you go add another feature, if you add a TiVo-like feature that's really cool, you know that you're going to get the distribution because you already have these daily interactions with customers. Patrick: Yeah, I absolutely love it. And I've got like six follow-up questions because I think we could kind of pick apart this as an investment strategy, almost the rest of the conversation. The first is around infrastructure and how you think about things like Amazon web services that are on bare metal or things like Twilio and Stripe, which are certainly underneath a lot and operating a lot of stuff on top of them, but typically are sort of abstracted away by developers so end users aren't interfacing with them. So I guess another way of asking the question is, what do you think about infrastructure and how much does interface with an actual end customer matter in terms of this way of thinking? Alex: And I think it depends on what you're trying to do. So I often call this the presentation layer conundrum, which is, I co-founded another company called Affirm that does point of sale lending. And if you look at payments online, there are very, very few companies that control the presentation layer. And presentation layer means they actually put something in front of the customer and they can actually change the graphics, they can change the text because they're not relegated to the back end, or actually the front end. Paypal is one of the very few, I mean, Affirm does this as well. Afterpay does this as well. But most companies that do anything in payments, Visa's worth $500 billion, so they must be doing something right. They are purely on the back end. They have no ability to actually change the interaction with the end customer. It limits what they can do. And that's not bad because again, Visa's worth half a trillion dollars, so they're clearly doing a lot of things right.But there are limitations on that because you basically have to assume that you're going to be this dominant, middle-aware layer, do that as efficiently as possible, or become a protocol, or become like this dominant backend system of truth. But what I often talk about in this operating system thesis, which is, you tend not to have this optionality of product expansion, unless you own the customer's interaction on the backend. Taking an example like Stripe, you use them as one of the ones that you quoted as like backend infrastructure. So Stripe has no interaction with the consumer. Generally has no interaction with the consumer. But Stripe, because they control the backend business, ""I'm a business. I sell t-shirts online and there was a credit card form on my website. That's how customers pay me. That's processed with Stripe. The customers don't know it's Stripe."" Just like if I send them a text message, customers don't know it's Twilio, that's all fine. ""But I, as the business would rather get paid more quickly, or I would rather, I want to take out a loan secured by my future credit card receivables."" Well, because Stripe is the system of truth for me that knows what my chance of selling more t-shirts is next Tuesday, they still have product expansion capability with me on the backend.And they can say, ""I'm going to offer you, t-shirt company seller, a loan because I know it's secured by these credit card receivables that were first in-line in, and it's effectively a lien that I can exercise."" But it's very, very hard if not impossible, because they don't control the presentation layer, for Stripe to offer a service to the t-shirt buyer, if that makes sense? So a lot of this is really about expansion. There are very, very few companies that have the ability to kind of go what I would say, B to B to C, the business to business to consumer. Like Affirm actually was kind of conceived as an idea where we could get the end customers at Peloton because we were offering loans to them, and Peloton one of those to be branded as Affirm and not as Peloton loans. Because if you don't pay your loan on time, like they don't want to get mad at you, they want Affirm to get mad at you. They want to wash their hands of that responsibility.I think in this framework, Twilio, if they play their cards right, and they clearly have, they have this ability to cross sell and upsell other products to the same customers, and they have the ability, and this is like the very, very rare thing, but they have the ability to scale with the scale of the business. Like the really cool thing about both AWS and Twilio is that yes, they could both face downward pricing pressure from competitors that offer the same services, but switching costs can be pretty high. So maybe Azure is cheaper this month, but how do I go switch all my servers over? And there are, of course, tools that do that, but it's hard. But the really nice thing is that somebody like Twilio. Twilio goes and signs up Uber when Uber is one week old. I don't know the exact story on this, but I assume it was something like this. And who would have thought that Uber would turn into this giant, giant business for Twilio? But of course it did. Or Amazon signs up this tiny company called Pinterest when Pinterest is one week old. Who would've thought that Pinterest would be such a giant AWS customer? But it became one.It's kind of nice when you're able to retain the customer, grow with the customer, really scale with the customer's success, which is what I mean by that, and then ideally you then control distribution to that customer. So if you happen to be privileged to have a great product team that builds new products and world-class products, you have instant distribution because you might not be the system of record, like AWS probably isn't the system of record for Pinterest. And in fact, that doesn't really make sense in that context for the context that they use the term, they're not the operating system for Pinterest, but they're the means of production if you will. They go build five new products. If those products are great, or even moderately okay, or just good enough, the chance of them getting that distribution is so much higher than a third-party that just shows up and says, ""Hey, we've got a product that's pretty good. Why don't you go use it?"" It's too much work because you got to go struggle to get the distribution. Patrick: What have you learned about the sequencing to build one of these operating systems over time? Because when you take something to market, you're not going to come with every feature. Toast came to market with something that's narrower than what it currently offers its customers. So you have to sort of order things and choose things on the way to becoming the operating system and the system of record. What have you learned there? What are the most effective entrepreneurs do? And this may be different in horizontal versus vertical operating systems. What lessons for entrepreneurs that want to build an operating system in terms of sequencing? Alex: The sad truth is that even though you're better off building an operating system than building a commoditized feature, you really need some kind of fundamental change in the world. It's that kind of tailwinds that makes your operating system appealing. So what was one that happened recently? It was the shift to Cloud. ""I'm running all of these things on my premises and my IT person was sick again, and my system went down and blah, blah, blah. I don't want to deal with that again. I want to go switch to something that I don't have to maintain and I'll just pay for it monthly."" And this has been a decades long shift. I mean, there are still plenty of businesses that don't run in the Cloud, but that was a massive tailwind for enabling, ""I want to run Workday and not PeopleSoft,"" or ""I want to run NetSuite and not Microsoft Dynamics."" All of these shifts to the Cloud where one part of this enablement, because I don't think that customers wake up and say, ""Hey, I want an operating system that doesn't really make sense."" They'll say, ""I want a feature."" Just like, I as a customer, by the way, would say, ""I want TiVo. TiVo is awesome."" It's very, very hard to lead with the whole ball, if you will, the whole operating system thing is just bad product marketing.What's good product marketing is, ""Hey, do you want to loan?"" And people say, they raise their hand and say, ""Hey, I want a loan."" So to answer your question, what I've seen is the template that normally works is you lead with the very exciting feature that customers want, that's different. You hopefully have your buttressed by this tailwind of a underlying platform shifts. So, ""Oh, wow. Mobile has come out,"" or ""Wow, Cloud has come out."" And now you can do new things. Like Toast allows every waiter and waitress to carry around that tablet. I guess you could have done that 20 years ago with your PalmPilots or something. They wouldn't have worked. It would have been terrible. So again, you've got this tailwind. You probably start off with one very, very narrow feature that you can do better. So for Toast, a lot of it was just credit card processing and payment processing. So you had to go upgrade your old credit card terminals to accept the chip and pin kind of thing, the EMV system. So you start with that, but then if you just do that, you're probably running the risk of having a commodity service that's going to get replaced by somebody who marginally under prices you, so you have to very, very quickly figure out, ""How do I just retain this customer, serve as their operating system, add three or four other features as quickly as possible. And if I do, I'm probably in good shape. If not, I might kind of be screwed.""This is the hard thing as an investor, by the way, which is, I'll meet a company that says, ""Okay, we're going to do lending to small businesses by sending out postal mail to them."" I say, ""Well, wow. Like somebody else is going to come along and send the same postal mail, but offer a 2% lower rate. And then you're kind of screwed."" So how does this not become a race to the bottom? As far as entrepreneurs, in fact, all entrepreneurs that think about this problem, they're like, ""Well, here's what we're going to do. We're actually going to do this first. We're going to get them on our loan. Then we're going to handle all of their bookkeeping for them because we built our own version of NetSuite, and we're going to do this and we're going to do that."" And it's like, this is the Trojan horse, or this is what we often call in venture land, the wedge. This is the wedge that we're using to pry ourselves into this particular business and aggressively expand.And then the hard thing to really evaluate from that point is number one, it doesn't matter what your plan is. Everybody has a plan. But what really matters is will the customer go for it? Is that an appealing value proposition for the customer? If yes, okay, great. And then number two is, can you actually execute on that quickly enough? And then number three, which is linked to number one and number two, is can you retain the customer long enough? Can you basically repel the competitive forces that lower rates long enough with enough stickiness or enough inertia, and inertia is often the thing that you need. The object that's in motion is just kind of wants to stay in motion. The object that still wants to stay still. And both of those actually can work in your favor. But can you avoid these competitive forces long enough to allow your internal execution around product and engineering to go build these other products that you can then cross sell and hopefully become over time the system of record, versus I think what you were getting at, which is if you over-engineer and you spend five years in that garage with your co-founder and other members of your team building what you think customers might want, you have no idea.It's just very, very hard to figure out. So you're better off with a wedge. And I think a lot of the best businesses at the early stage, they have an unfair path to getting what I would say, five customers. Because if you have an unfair path to getting one customer, because your uncle is somebody who owns something, well then you might over-engineer the product for that one customer and it has great applicability for that one customer, but no applicability thereafter. There's a great Simpsons episode where Homer designs a car. It's the stupidest car. It's great for Homer, but it's the worst car in the history of the world because it has no applicability for people that are not Homer Simpson. You run into that problem. If you're able to do this with five customers that trust you, and this is really hard, by the way. If I were running a business, I'm running a dentist office, I'm a dentist, and my cousin says to me, ""Hey, I've got this dental practice management software."" And I ask, ""How much cash do you have left?"" They're like, ""How long is your company in the ground?"" I was like, ""Well, I raised enough money. I had nine months in cash."" And it's like, ""What happens then?"" ""Well, we'll probably have to shut down the cutlets."" I'm not going to run my dental practice on you. Are you crazy? It doesn't make any sense.If you could come up with some way of not tricking anybody, of course, but really selling this vision of what you're going to accomplish. Come up with a wedge. Or even if you don't come up with a wedge, get five people to fundamentally trust you, metaphorical five, it could be more, to trust you so that you actually are building a product around what the overall market wants, then you can really make one of these things work and you end up with a potentially phenomenal success. Toast is a great example of that. I don't know all of the different steps that they took to get there, but it's a really, really remarkable testament to what you can do when you become the operating system. And I think for companies like them, what other products and services do restaurants want? They're probably 20 other ones, but now through the operating system, their customer acquisition costs on existing customers is zero. So they should be able to beat anybody who is the metaphorical TiVo in this example. Patrick: What about the rise of the creator class and the more individual, sole proprietor type businesses, online, digital only businesses? Is that in your view, the next tail end after cloud and mobile, that might mean we're going to see a lot of interesting vertical software businesses that are operating systems? Alex: Absolutely. I don't know if it's the same technology or platform change. So I would say mobile and cloud were both things that new technology enabled this. Now, COVID tells me that I like staying home and I don't like going to my office and I can do all these things on my own, but shoot, it turns out if I'm a lawyer and I already have 10 clients that love me and I know they'll pay me, there's a lot of stuff that I need to figure out on my own. And there's an essay that we wrote on this called ""The Rise of the Solopreneur"". So I want to be a lawyer on my own. Well, I already passed the bar. I already worked at Wilson Sonsini or something, so people know who I am. I've got 10 clients that love me that will follow me anywhere, but I need a website, I need to process payments, I need some kind of CRM tool. I need to be able to hire people. If I want an assistant, how do I do that? There's a lot of work and it's all these disparate, not connected systems.So I love this idea of, I call it business in a box. So you want to go start a law firm. Well, obviously there was some things that a firm does, which are getting you clients. Maybe you could do that, but that's not a software problem, that's more of a marketplace problem or an advertising problem. But all of the other back-office things that can be done by software. And it's very, very different for all of these fields. And what I think is interesting is that people decide to... You don't really think of lawyers as being part of the creator economy, to your point, who are accountants or doctors. If I want to break out from the mothership, I just want to do the things that the firm did for me, but it's going to involve 18 disparate systems and it's a pain in the butt.I think that's definitely a trend. And it's one that we're very, very excited about. It's the operating system, but very tightly targeted because the sole proprietor lawyer just has a completely different set of needs than the sole proprietor photographer or the sole proprietor yoga instructor. But there was a great round of software many, many years ago, and still today, mind-body sells to yoga studios, it performs a different function than people who used to work at a larger corporation or a larger entity, they just want to figure out how to branch off and break off on their own. And you just have to custom assemble the set of tools for that group of customers. The only challenge with this is, again, it goes back to the thing that I was talking about with the TiVo problem, customer acquisition is challenging.But I think you have a much better chance of solving the customer acquisition problem if you have a very narrow set of, ""This is Toast, it only does stuff for restaurants,"" as opposed to quote-unquote, ""We're an operating system for you."" What does that even mean? It's why I've been skeptical about a lot of tools that come out for what I would call creator economy or passion economy or sole proprietors without really individualizing the product. I'm very not skeptical about the rise of all three of those. It's more of, what does it mean to be a solo worker? Well, it's just like an Uber driver needs a completely different set of things for their tax filing and the number of miles that they drove and all of those things. That's a product, but it's very, very different than other verticals. Patrick: In addition to this awesome idea of the operating system, another thing obviously that you spend a lot of time thinking about is FinTech. And I'd love to turn the conversation there for a while. It's where you do a lot of your investing, it's where you founded businesses before. And maybe the right way to introduce our conversation on FinTech is with this funny joke you've got about the pig. Maybe you could give us the pig joke as an entry point into the world of FinTech. Alex: I love this one and I apologize for people that listen to this and they've heard me say it 10 times before. But basically the joke is there're two pigs in a barn. One of them says to the other, he's like, ""This place is awesome. Everything is free, it's heated, there's free food, the water tastes great."" And the caption underneath says, ""If you're not the customer, you're the product being sold,"" which of course means that the pigs are being turned into bacon and they don't even know it yet, but they're living a life of luxury until they do. Basically, those were the two business models. Either you sell a product to a customer, and this is either a transactional business model or a subscription business model. So Peloton sells you a bike and they sell you a subscription, and you're the customer. Or it's the Facebook business model, which is you, the user of Facebook, are not the customer, you're the product being sold. Hopefully the product that Facebook is offering is good, that's why you show up. But the actual customer is the advertiser. And that's where Facebook, where Google, draws in most of their revenue. So when we would meet a company, we'd say, ""Well, which one are you? Are you an advertising company or are you a transaction company?"" Because it was like bucket one, bucket two, there was no bucket three.Now there is a bucket three and bucket three is effectively what I call embedded financial services. So now if you were to extend that joke, it turns out it's like, ""Oh no, the barn is free, we just have to use the checking account provided by the barn owner and hopefully use this debit card that has more than exempt interchange on it."" Et cetera, et cetera. I joined this firm in 2015 to spin up and run our FinTech practice. But now almost every company in some way, shape, or form is a FinTech company. Not because it is a pure play FinTech company, but because if you're building the next Facebook, if you're Mark Zuckerberg of 2021, you now see that there are three routes to revenue. You charge transaction fees or a subscription revenue to your customers, and you may sell advertising, and you might decide, ""Hey, it's very, very lucrative for me to offer financial products and services to my customers because they already trust me, they know who I am. And if I'm able to be the dominant checking account. If I'm their checking account,"" which I know sound strange, you would think you get your checking account with Bank of America or First Republic or Chase or something like that. But if you have your checking account with somebody, they have so much control and ability, going back to the old refrain, to upselling products to sell you other things. So as an example, it might sound insane, but Uber and Lyft should offer checking accounts to all of their drivers for a few reasons.One is it turns out both of those businesses are historically supply side constraints. So everybody wants to take an Uber from the airport at 5:00 PM, especially with all the stimulus checks and everything else that's hitting, not as many people want to drive for Uber. They drive for Uber for two weeks then they quit. What would be very smart is we're going to give them a checking account, and that has two benefits. One is when they're running low on money, I can send them a message saying, ""Hey, you're low on money. Why don't you drive for Uber today? We'll pay twice as much."" It's got this daily active use product. They don't have to re-market to that customer because they already own the customer. And number two, the way that the whole, you've already listened to my visa thing because you interviewed for that, but for people that don't know, the way that the credit card and debit card infrastructure works is that there's typically something in the neighborhood of a 2% fee per card swipe, which is assessed to the merchant, which can be retained by what's called the issuing bank or the issuer of the card.So if Lyft gives every driver a card and a free checking account, and the free checking account is a lot more appealing than the one that Bank of America gives you that has minimum fees and all this crap. They give you this free thing, they own you as a customer, 2% of all the spending that you get, they get to keep, which is very compelling, and they get to win you back as a driver when you might be low on cash. And they've got that real retention at work. And again, you wouldn't have thought of that as a use case 10 or 15 or 20 years ago. But now what we see is that even outside of what I would call the FinTech team, a huge number of enterprise software companies, and a huge number of consumer software companies, are trying to monetize with FinTech as a third leg of that stool. Patrick: Could you give maybe one example of that, that you've seen that you think is interesting? Because I'm most curious about what big functions, big financial service's functions are most likely to start getting embedded in other non-financial businesses. So what's an example that drives home the point? Alex: I think Toast is probably the clearest one, which is they offer payroll. If you're a restaurant, why would you use ADP? Just use Toast. If you're a restaurant and you need a loan because you know that you have working capital issues, Toast can actually go extend you alone. Toast of course, their primary source of revenue is interchange where they're charging the restaurant something like 2.9% and the cost of actually doing that is probably a blended 1.85% or something like that. So they're making that 1% plus spread on all the credit card processing. Toast is fundamentally not a credit card processor, they are a software company, which is very, very different than... There was a company like Toast... Well, they're still around today, but it's called Heartland Payment Systems. I forgot who they were part of now, it's probably FIS or Pfizer or somebody, or WePay . But Heartland was basically, they were an independent sales organization that sold credit card terminals predominantly to restaurants. They didn't have any software overlay. That's why Heartland is not as relevant today as Toast is, and certainly not as big of a company, because Toast is the operating system that runs the restaurant.That's what they are first and foremost. If you ask a restaurant owner, that's what they're going to tell you, but they happen to make money via embedded financial services. That's probably the clearest one. But the dental practice management software as well, there's a company called Synchrony, they have a business called Care Credit, which is basically point of sale lending for elective medical procedures. And it's predominantly for things like LASIK or dental or some kinds of dermatology and plastic surgery. And being embedded at the point of sale, or even before the point of sale, like the dentist, I went to the dentist, I sadly had a cavity. When I went to go check out and make arrangements to come back with my very painful filling, they said, ""Hey, it's going to be 400 and whatever it was dollars, but here's a payment plan if you would like it,"" because that's embedded into the software that they're using. And I'm sure they're probably making more money on that. They're probably keeping more of that than if it was just an upfront payment where they had to pay 2% to Visa MasterCard or the visa MasterCard system, if you will. I think there are a lot of examples of this.I see it now with insurance, where a lot of companies are saying, ""Hey, we want to bundle in."" When do you want to buy life insurance? Probably when you have a kid, when you buy a house, or when something very tragic happens to one of your friends, that's when you might want to buy life insurance. So why not offer a life insurance cross sale if you're a mortgage company? I wouldn't be surprised if Zillow decides to say, ""Hey, do you want life insurance now?"" And maybe there's a way of even lowering the interest rate on your mortgage. This will be a little bit complicated for Zillow to do. But that would be a great example where that's a perfect non adverse selection point in time, so you don't want to sell insurance to people that are planning on dying, of course, life insurance people. But you want to sell it when somebody is buying a house, how do you find that point in time? That's an embedded financial service where if you can make the cross sell very, very easy and you have the distribution, again, very, very powerful. Patrick: How do you think about which financial service functions are the most attractive from a model standpoint? So the Toast is great because they get to enjoy a piece of all the transactions happening within their ecosystem. You're basically riding commerce, you're taxed on restaurant commerce at that point. Insurance is this more one-off example, it's infrequent that people buy it, maybe it's very valuable in terms of the individual order. What does that spectrum? How do you think about the different things that we will buy from these different companies that are financial services functions, and are those of the same as they've always been or are there new ones popping up? Alex: There's a third element to that, which is can you underwrite better and more efficiently because you have more data? One of the things that actually is the most exciting to me around what could financial services accomplish, and I'll go back to answering your question in a second, but I think this is pretty germane. Which is if you really wanted to revolutionize lending, what you would do is you would link it to payroll. Because I think in the US there's something like $1.2 trillion, probably more now, of unsecured credit card debt. The average rate is 18%. Why is it 18%? Well, because you never know if these people are going to pay you back. There's no enforcement mechanism outside of calling them a hundred times and saying they're a bad person and reporting them to a credit bureau, which doesn't always change people's behavior. But where do people get their money from to begin with? Well, every two weeks, twice a month, depending on how they're paid, they get paid from their employer, and then they are effectively a slow router and hopefully paying their bills on time and routing the paycheck that came in, the after-tax pay that came into their checking account to all of these different places. Wouldn't it be really cool if you could actually get a loan from your employer?Which sounds crazy, like, ""I don't want to take out a loan from the company that I work for,"" but I would love it if I could... I need a better term for this than wage garnishment, because wage garnishment sounds very, very bad, but if I could say I want 5% of my paycheck sent automatically without my interceding at all to Capital One. And then capital one will say, ""I will charge you 3% interest because I know you're going to pay me every single week or every single two weeks or once a month or whatever, versus 18% interest."" There's a powerful overlay as well, which is if you bundle these things more tightly, you're often able to underwrite customers better. Because this is the problem. If I'm loaning money to a hundred people or a hundred businesses and I believe that half of them will not pay me back, I have to charge the entire group a hundred percent interest just to break even. Whereas if I can either underwrite them better or if I can link into just because of, not necessarily software, but just because of the stack that I control, where I see, I can link into, I can make sure that the money hits me first, I will be able to charge them dramatically less money.So it's not just, ""Where are the limitations on this?"" I think there are a lot of opportunities to unlock much fairer pricing. How many more people would buy trip cancellation insurance when you're shopping at Expedia, which they offer, if it were really, really cheap based on your proclivity to either get sick or not? I just made that example up. But you can imagine where if you're able to price things more intelligently either because you're somehow in the flow of funds, you're in the flow of data and it's customized for that particular customer, I think you can actually broaden the scope of how this works. But going back to your original question, I think there is a very interesting thing to think about, which is, do customers want bundled experiences or unbundled experiences? So Robinhood is effectively, they've started bundling in other things beyond obviously core trading. If Chime offers trading, is that what their customers want or do Chime customers, Chime being the leading neobank in the US, do Chime customers want to have a Chinatown and a Robinhood account, or do they want to have a Chime account and a Robinhood account and maybe a lending account with blending club or upgrade, and do they want a life insurance account with some life insurance company and, and, and? Versus the bundled approach? I don't know.I think that's a very, very good question. I think a lot of it, honestly, it goes back to inertia. If you can get them first, and this is the powerful thing, if by virtue of the fact that you're bundling in the data, or you have access to the funds, you're able to dramatically, dramatically price improve for the customer. That's a very, very compelling reason. So for something like stock trading, it's hard to be free or very low commissions, but for something like insurance, wow, that's super interesting. Because if you have data that allows you to underwrite better, like you see this right now where Tesla has your driving score and Tesla's starting to actually assure you. Which is pretty cool because Geico can save you 15%, but if you drive a Tesla and they know that you're a safe driver and always follow the speed limit, which Geico does not do, it's not because they don't want to, they just don't own the car. But theoretically Tesla should be able to under-price that. Or if Tesla was able to do something where it's like, ""Hey, link your..."" Again, wage garnishment bad, but something that is a positive non pejorative form of that, ""Pay us right away and your interest rate on your lease or your interest rate on your car purchase is going to be even lower.""Which would be probably their captive auto finance company that would be doing that. But that would be very, very compelling as well. So I think there are a lot of areas for cross sell where, what excites me is the market opportunity could be much, much bigger when the distributors are, again, able to underwrite better based on data and potentially controlling the flow of funds, which is like the Toast example for giving the loan to the restaurant. The cheapest cost of capital for a restaurant would probably look something like a factoring arrangement. It's called a merchant cash advance from the person that actually controls their funds. And normally you think of factoring as being more expensive, but in this case it could be a lot less expensive because the risk of loss can actually be very, very accurately measured. Versus what a bank has to rely on, which is, we have no idea, we have no bundled relationship with the customer. Patrick: I asked Dave Girouard at Upstart what his company might enable over 10 years, and he gave this cool answer, which is basically, anyone anywhere just has alone and terms presented to them at all times. And it's based on all the data we have about them and they can just hit it or not. They can take the loan and terms are pre-calculated and you're pre-approved and everything's seamless and interesting. It's fun to think about that applied to everything, not just lending, but all financial functions. If we think about finance existing because of basically the timing of cash flows, finance is just handling cashflow timing problems for other people, businesses, and individuals. If you think about it through that lens, what is most exciting to you about the future of FinTech? You get to see this from all angles, companies, big trends, et cetera, you've built companies in this space. What is the big, exciting future that this shift towards data and financial technology companies might unlock for the world? Alex: The timing of cash flows, it's almost like this broken thing that doesn't allow for customization, and therefore it requires people to go externally to go borrow money. Whereas I should be able to borrow money from... When this company Bill Me Later came out, I was like, ""Well, that's a really good idea. And actually it was inspiration in many ways for a firm many years later."" But I registered the domain name Pay Me Sooner, I still have that domain name, because I just think that there's so many options where it's like, ""Wow, I have to borrow money because my customers are paying at 15. Those customers might even have too much cash, they're very unhappy with the interest rate that they're getting from their bank, or whoever's providing that. Why can't I offer them a small incentive in the form of a lower price for them to pay me sooner?"" It goes in the pile of unused business ideas that I have. But actually there are a lot of these receivables, exchanges, and whatnot. But I think it's one of many examples where, can you come up with... We started this conversation many minutes ago with DVRs, the digital video recorders. like replay TV and TiVo.I wish you had that for money. By that I mean, why does a consumer get paid every... Not a consumer, but a worker, an employee, why do they get paid either semi-monthly or bi-weekly? That doesn't make any sense. Well, it kind of does because the employer would rather pay every two weeks than pay every hour, but then that forces the employee to borrow money to maybe pay their rent on time. And that's not fair, they should be able to customize those terms. And maybe the employer would be willing to customize those terms. Why doesn't that happen? Well, there are many reasons. Sometimes it's the employer's cash flows, but in other cases, it's competently complex. How do you manage all of this complexity? It was very, very difficult, I can imagine, in the pre Excel, pre software era to introduce, ""Hey, you're GE, you have 300,000 employees. Let everybody choose their own payday. That sounds like a bad idea. We're not going to do that."" But why? That's not that complicated, it's just moving money around. And money is bits, it's not atoms anymore, so just figure out that problem.And now you have a massive unlock. You've actually exempted the need for exactly as you said, finances the, basically intermediating these differences in cash flows, and solving working capital issues. Now you don't have one. You can actually solve this. And there are some that look like that. There are others where again, the reason why I use this grand experiment of lending is so inefficient today, because what is a credit score? It's basically trying to figure out a business or consumer's willingness and ability to repay. And generally, for businesses, if you actually have a Moody's, Fitch, or S&P credit rating, it's not about your willingness. You're not going to just say, ""Hey. I don't really feel like paying my coupon. I'm just not going to do it."" But for a consumer, that happens a lot. It's like, ""Ah, I don't really feel like paying Capital One. Screw them."" And you don't know when that's going to happen. They might get lazy. There are all sorts of reasons why a consumer might not pay on the willingness side. But ability is more mathematical. It's not criminal. I shouldn't say that, use a very broad term. But it's really, really unfortunate that you're not able to just make those a little bit more mathematical.And that's why I like, and I will come up with a better term than voluntary wage garnishment; but this idea that I, as a consumer, can choose where my money goes. And you basically take up the willingness score. If Capital One knew that everybody that they loan money to is going to pay them back, unless they are killed or fired, well, that takes out so many other different exigencies that they normally have to think about, which is, ""Well, what if they just decide not to pay us because they decided not to pay us?"" That's the willingness part. Well, why not make this money movement more automated? And this is what smart contracts are on the crypto sense. ""I know that the money will get dispersed to me, and therefore, I can offer a much, much, much lower rate."" And that's the thing that's kind of crazy in the world of finance today, which is, you have so many people that are seeking any kind of deal, because interest rates are zero, and that's caused all sorts of craziness in the world that I'm sure you keep track of as well. And then, you have so many other people that are paying very, very high fees on all sorts of things.And it's like, ""How do I reconcile the fact that those two worlds exist at the exact same time?"" It doesn't make any sense. And there are many areas that just have not truly been democratized; unless an instrument has truly been securitized, and it trades, and there's a fair market for it, there are all sorts of these very, very esoteric things that are just one-off areas, where again, you can't really figure out this willingness and ability score, if it's anything around lending and credit. And then, lots of investors that would clearly lower the cost of capital for the other side, that would happily take a higher interest rate than zero that they're getting with their bank. They have no access to that asset class, either. So I think there's so many examples like that, which I'm just super excited about. Patrick: Is it too much of a stretch to think about this as, ""There's just too much interest paid in the world."" Or, ""The profits of the financial services sector, if anything, the quality of life in the world, we want them to go down over time, because data is better and better. And there's just smarter and smarter ways of doing this."" Is that the right way of thinking about this? Alex: Yes and no. You could imagine a scenario where the profits go up, because the rate goes down. And that's actually the one that I'm more excited about. So you expand the pie dramatically, because there are lots of people that are locked out of credit right now. Or there are lots of people that decide not to use credit, because they don't want to pay 18%. But they would happily take credit at 5%; but it's all one size fits all, so they don't do it. So, when you lower the price of something, you have your upward-facing supply curve, and your downward-sloping demand curve. And what you should see happen, is, ""Wow. We're lowering the cost of something. We're making it much fairer."" And conceptually, you're going to expand the pie dramatically.But right now, it's just too one size fits all, and in many cases, intransigent, in terms of just changing these things. So yes, I think it probably is good. That's the hard part is again, it's kind of prognostic in the future around, ""How much bigger with some of these markets be if the pricing were really, really bare minimum, if you take out transaction costs?"" And I've forgotten, there's some famous economics study on this; but basically, if you take out transaction costs, you should see a lot more transaction volume. And then, there are all sorts of things that get built or get done, that just don't happen today, because the surging cost of the transaction fees are just fundamentally too high. Patrick: You wrote a really interesting thread, and a good tie back to our original conversation on Visa, about the threat that ""buy now pay later"" companies may pose to companies like Visa. And this is just right at the beating heart of financial technology and finance, generally speaking. I'd love you to just summarize your thought process here, because Visa has been viewed by so many, and we explored it together, I encourage people to go listen, as one of history's great business modes. And so, the concept that there may be innovation happening in this space that may pose a threat to longstanding, entrenched winners I'll call them, is really interesting. Could you walk us through this concept? Alex: There have been many, many attempts to out Visa, or MasterCard and say, ""I'm going to build a new payment mechanism."" But you really have to appeal to two different constituents. You have to make it very compelling to merchants. And it's very easy to make anything compelling to merchants; just be like, ""Hey. Do you want to pay 2% fees or 0% fees? How about zero?"" And every merchant's like, ""Yay. I want to do that."" So it's very easy to make it compelling to merchants. But then you have to make it compelling to consumers, and you say, ""Hey. I'm going to give you no rewards, because I know you like getting rewards, but I'm going to give you none. Does that sound compelling?"" And nobody raises their hand. But of course, the 2% fees the merchants are paying, most of that funds the rewards that consumers are driven by. So that's one of many reasons why that mode is so high. So there have been many, many attempts to topple, or undermine, or figure out some kind of Trojan horse to disrupt this payment system; but nothing has really appealed organically to consumers or merchants.There have been many things that appeal inorganically, by which I mean, Target has something called the Red Card; and because Target really hates paying Visa and MasterCard and that whole system 2%, they have decided to give consumers 5%, which is of course more than 2%, if they don't use a Visa or MasterCard or American Express; rather, they use the Target Red Card. And it's like, ""Maybe that works. And they're able to take away those 5% fees and make them zero."" But until they do, it's an inorganic approach. So the thing that's interesting about ""buy now, pay later"" is that it actually got organic traction with both consumers and merchants. So that's reason number one. And why does it have organic attraction with both? There's a famous clip, and you can look it up on YouTube, where Steve Balmer is pillaring the iPhone, saying, ""Nobody's going to buy a $700 or $800 phone."" And he was wrong, but he was right. He was right, because nobody was going to buy an $800 phone; but a lot of people would buy a phone if it was just $10 a month for the next 80 months on their AT&T bill, which is basically what happened.So that's why all these expensive smartphones took off. They were better products. But normally, better and more expensive doesn't necessarily work; better and cheaper does. And that was kind of ""buy now, pay later"" for that space. It didn't go on your credit card, where you're going to get charged 18%. It was done by the principles involved; the AT&T and the Apple decided to go make this cheaper, and to go sell more units. Real clear benefit for the consumer, and again, real clear benefit for the merchant, because the merchant is going to sell more stuff. If they're able to get out of the one size fits all financing regime that credit cards offer, which is credit cards have... They only see two different items that you're buying. You're either getting a cash advance, where you went to an ATM machine; and please don't do this, because they'll rip you off.You use your credit card and not your debit card, they're going to charge you like 35% on that thing. Or you are financing something that you bought at the store, in which case it's, I don't know, the 18%. They actually have no visibility, in terms of the item that you're buying. So why was this good for merchants? Because merchants were able to customize and say, ""Hey. We have too many of this item in our store. We want to charge 0% interest."" That was good for the merchant, because they moved more items if they're charging 0%; this is why car companies have their Labor Day sales, with 0% APR. It's good for the consumers, because consumers are going to buy something that otherwise they wouldn't, because the cost was too prohibitively high. And yes, they had financing available, but it was very unfair financing. So it took off organically; little spiel on that as the background.But what's really, really interesting, I think, is that... So number one, it's this new payment rail that has emerged, that it normally doesn't touch the Visa or MasterCard rails at all. And then, this is the really exciting thing, which is, Visa and MasterCard, because they're both so old, and this is not their fault at all, but because the system has five parties involved for a Visa or MasterCard transaction. You have the cardholder, me. You have the cardholders' issuing bank, called Capital One. You have the card network, Visa. You have the acquiring bank, call it First Data or Bank of America. And then, you have the merchant, call it Chipotle. And those are the five parties involved in the transaction; and Visa sitting in the middle, has no idea what I bought at Chipotle. They assume it's probably Mexican food because they're smart, but they have no idea what actual skew or stock keeping unit I bought. And the same thing is true at Walmart. If I go buy something at Walmart, Walmart probably has millions of skews. If I spent $422 at Walmart, Visa has no idea what I bought. Capital One has no idea what I bought. And then, even First Data has no idea what I bought; because Walmart doesn't want those three knowing what I bought, and the data infrastructure doesn't even allow it.That's why, in many cases, a merchant name will get cut off. It will say you spent money at sq*, then the first 15 digits of the restaurant's name. It's just very, very antiquated technology. And it's kind of hard to change, because it's a standards-based protocol. How do you get everybody to just... All five of those parties, really not the consumer, but the other four to agree to use this more modern thing? So, one of the other cool things about the NPL, is that in order to underwrite effectively; Walmart doesn't want to offer 0% financing on Purell wipes during the height of the pandemic, because they're going to sell out of Purell wipes anyway. They want to offer 0% financing on... I don't know, the old LG television, before the new one comes out, because they know they're going to sell more if it's 0% to the consumer, well, the merchant has to pay for that. That's going to be a higher merchant discount rate. So they need to customize it based on the item being bought. The very interesting thing about the NPL. This is a long summary; my tweetstorm is a little bit shorter. But number one, it's a parallel network that actually appeal to consumers and merchants; which sounds insignificant, but it's pretty interesting, for a subset of transactions.It doesn't make sense to be NPL at $15 purchase. And then number two, is it has item-specific information. And you can do a lot of things with item-specific information, beyond just financing. You could say, ""Okay. I want to apply a coupon. How do I do that? How does Visa apply a coupon? Or how does Capital One apply a coupon for an individual item that you bought at Walmart when they have no idea, if you actually bought that individual item?"" The answer is they can't. They can only offer basket-level discounts. So what the NPL is, is it's the first parallel network that actually has gotten to scale, with consumers and merchants, that has item-specific information. And all it does is, very expensive purchases of $1,000 or more, that it divides up into different payments. It still has a good niche to be in, because yes, Visa launched theirs, and MasterCard launched theirs. But it's never going to work, because they don't know the item-specific information. Again, Walmart doesn't want to discount Purell wipes with low-cost financing.They want to discount, and pay for the discounting, I should say, the discounting being the suppressed, or I should say subsidized interest rate to the consumer. They want to do that for very expensive items that they would sell more of if they could offer better payment terms. It's got item-specific information, and it has pretty good ubiquitous coverage and name recognition with consumers and merchants. And there just hasn't been anything like that, at least in the offline world. PayPal arguably has done this, as well. PayPal is a parallel set of rails. A lot of PayPal transactions never touch credit cards or debit cards. But PayPal also fundamentally started off as a wrapper for credit cards and debit cards. I use PayPal all the time; but PayPal is effectively an abstraction layer that ends up charging my Capital One card. And that's not the way that Affirm works.Afterpay and Klarna are little bit more like PayPal does, because they tend to just charge your card. But what Afterpay does is pretty interesting; they effectively created what I would call a synthetic credit card from a debit card. So if you only have a debit card, can't get a credit card. Now you kind of have a credit card, because your debit card is just getting charged four times over the next six weeks or so. But that's kind of the big idea, which is, ""What else can be done with this parallel network, given that merchants are not huge fans of the current oligopoly, the charges, and the very high fees?"" Patrick: I think it's the perfect excuse to sort of ask a question that puts a bow on the entire conversation, which is your idea about, you think about business writ large. It's sort of the perennial struggle between distribution and innovation. I just love this simple concept, and I'd love you to summarize that concept in closing here. And also, maybe just riff on how you think that has changed across maybe your business and investing career, and how it might change in the future. Alex: This quote that I use all the time, is I said, ""The battle between every startup and incumbent, comes down to whether the startup can get distribution before the incumbent gets innovation."" To clarify what that might mean, ""Will Vanguard invent a robo-advisor, innovation, before, I don't know, Wealthfront gets $5 trillion of assets under management?"" That's kind of the battle: which one of those two will win? And I think normally, in financial services, distribution is just so much more important than innovation, because it's not to say that innovation is not important, but these are not atom-splitting things. These are not very, very hard things to build. You have to build a pretty good product, but the incumbent can fast-follow or slow-follow, as the case might be, and eventually build it. So it's really informed my investment theory, which is, a lot of the companies that I invest in, I either like the infrastructure companies, where I'm not smart enough to figure out which one of the 400 neobanks is going to win, and get the most distribution. Or even if I want.I'd just bought Google stock and Facebook stock or something, because that's where they all advertise. But, if they're all using Plaid, or if they're all using Marketa, or they're all using one of these infrastructure layers, the infrastructure layer actually becomes very interesting. So that's one. Or, every now and then, you find some kind of very, very distinctive distribution wedge, where it's like, ""Wow. Like these guys built a good product; good for them. But they figured out a way to either make it organic, which almost never happens."" Where people just tell their friends. Yeah, you might tell your friends about some things, but you're not going to say, ""Wow. I love getting a mortgage at First Republic. It was such a great experience."" It's not even relevant for most of your friends.You're not going to tell them. But if you come up with something, if you see something as an investor, that has just amazing, amazing, rapid adoption and distribution, that is very, very compelling. Rapid adoption of distribution is not like, ""Wow. This company figured out how to buy Facebook ads really effectively."" Because somebody is going to figure out how to buy them even more effectively. It's, they've figured out a different channel that cannot simply be exhausted as readily as what I would call these democratized channels; where it's like, it's great for the world that Google and Facebook allow anybody to be the highest bidder. But it's not great for the long-term business value of anybody whose predominant source of customers and simply advertising on one of those two platforms. Because either the rules change, or somebody figures out how to go upside down on their economics; it just kind of imperils the source of oxygen, in the form of new customers, for the business. Patrick: Yeah. It's a fascinating framework. I love thinking about things this way, simplifying some of the other frameworks that you've come up with. And as always, I've just learned so damn much talk to you about, not just FinTech, but just startups and innovation, more generally speaking. I have loved all the frameworks you've introduced today. I ask the same closing question of everybody that I have on this, the main show. What is the kindest thing that anyone's ever done for you? Alex: Too many to list. I would definitely have to go with my parents, for creating me. So that's a very kind thing. But there's not just one case. But there are so many examples in Silicon Valley where I live, where you just go email somebody out of the blue; they'll spend time with you, they'll help you. Because it's really not zero sum; this isn't... As an entrepreneur, you're not trying to figure out some arbitrage investment theory that somebody else is going to go steal from you, like in the way that hedge funds might not share ideas like this with each other. Maybe they do. I don't know. But I mentioned, Max Levchin and I started the firm together. And that actually started when, I think I literally blind emailed him, saying, ""Hey. I like you. I like your history of what you've done. Why don't we meet to do this thing?"" And many brainstorms later, we ended up becoming friends, and doing this.But there are so many examples like that, where I was able to, I wouldn't call it punch above my weight class, because I wasn't punching above anything. I think it's that line of Death of a Salesman, ""I relied on the kindness of strangers"" to really situate me here, because I moved here in 2004. I knew nobody. I moved here because my wife kind of talked me into it. I was from Florida. I didn't want to move to California. And then, just a lot of kindness of strangers allowed me to meet some really incredible people, get some great ideas, and advanced my thinking. But I would have never gotten there, had I not just taken the initiative, but more importantly, had people not actually responded to my little easily deletable spam emails. Patrick: Wow, Alex, I'm so appreciative of everything you've taught me over the last couple of years, getting to know you. I really appreciate your time today. Thank you so much. Alex: Absolutely.

348,Sam Bankman-Fried - Creating a Perfect Market,Introduction," Patrick: My guest today is Sam Bankman-Fried, founder and CEO of leading cryptocurrency exchange FTX. In a little over two years, FTX has registered 1.2 million users, grown to facilitate 10.9 billion of daily trading volume and reached an 18 billion valuation. Prior to FTX, Sam worked at Jane Street Capital before founding a quant trading firm of his own Alameda Research. At just 29, Sam has packed a lot into a short period of time, and as I'm sure you'll hear, he has a special ability to harness uncertainty and think deeply across a range of topics.In our discussion, we cover the building blocks of a perfect market, the key areas of inefficiencies in today's exchanges, and Sam's North Stars of product design and effective altruism. We also talk about the fairness in crypto markets, how FTX thinks about user acquisition and derivatives as the key enablers of properly functioning markets. Please enjoy my great conversation with Sam Bankman-Fried.",220
349,Sam Bankman-Fried - Creating a Perfect Market,Earning to Give," Patrick: So Sam, I figured since this conversation's going to go over the place, we have to begin with your why or True North. I sometimes scribble down some words that help me frame these conversations, and I wrote down markets, profit, progress, infrastructure and philanthropy. And maybe you can just tell me, what's motivating to you. Do you think True North is a useful concept, and if so, what is yours? Sam: Totally. And I think I maybe have a whole different True North, depending on what level you're talking at. One thing is basically, how much do things motivate me on the day-to-day basis? I wake up, I go to work, I get an email, I have to respond to it, and what are sort of the things rattling around my head most frequently in making decisions there? And for that, I think that it's product design, product function, markets, technology, sort of efficient markets, just basically like, how do you build a good product and a powerful, efficient exchange and things like that? Things that resonate with me the most are things like, does the risk engine work? Is this a well-designed risk engine that gives people flexibility while making sure that the platform is safe.And maybe another thing is, does the general design of products in this space make sense? That's something that I think about actually quite a bit is, where are there places where you sort of look at how a space is being built out and just think that's probably an accident of history, that's probably not the chosen path, so to speak? And I think one example of this is markets not being 24/7, equities markets not being 24/7. It's not the biggest deal in the world, but I think it's sort of a pretty clear example if we're to do it over again, they definitely would be 24/7. And that they're not is sort of a historical holdover from a time when they were not electronic, and when there were physical pit specialists that were incredibly important to the functioning of the markets, and you had to give people time to sleep.Putting that aside for a second, you can then sort of zoom out to, all right, but how about when I reflect more generally on what I'm doing and think on sort of a much higher level about what prioritizing? And on that side, you get more philanthropy side, where it's not necessarily the most relevant thing day-to-day when I'm deciding, how should this product be designed? It's often pretty irrelevant. But when instead you're thinking about, what should I be doing with my life? High level, what should I be doing in prioritizing? In the end, my True North there is effective altruism and utilitarianism.And basically what that means from my perspective is, how can I maximize my positive impact on the world? And originally came from a perspective of, you're going to donate $1,000, where can you give it to save the most lives? But since the movement has transitioned into a much broader scope and thinking more generally, what are the causes and what are the interventions that do the most given the resources that you have? From my perspective, thinking about, what should I be trying to do with my life? I sort of ended up where I am earning to give, trying to make what I can so I can give as much as I can away and then thinking about what the most effective ways to do that are. Patrick: Why focus on the giving versus the building? And I wonder if you would agree that well-functioning markets, which is obviously a problem that you're working on or chosen to work on, have done more good for humanity, let's say, than any sort of philanthropic organization linearly taking in dollars and spending them on something versus organizing capital formation or markets forces for good. Obviously markets aren't perfect, but they seem to do a lot. Why think at all about philanthropy versus what I'll call reinvestment to build more infrastructure, to do more good? Sam: One thing, if you're thinking about generic charity-type thing versus making markets efficient, and I think that there are compelling arguments, as you said, for making markets efficient, efficient markets having had a really, really big impact on the world. And you can just see the impact on various countries' economy of how efficient their markets are. You can even see things like the economic hit that countries seem to take just from having too high stamp taxes on their stock markets, really killing liquidity, killing efficient markets. So I think that from that perspective, there has been really significant good done to economic development from having efficient markets and marketplaces. And I think that compares favorably to a lot of relatively ineffective charities, to a lot of places that are earnestly trying to do good in the world, but really not thinking very hard about how.But I think that there's a whole different ballpark of what you can accomplish if you think really hard about what the best thing to do is with your life and with your funds. And I think that you can find cases where there are organizations that I think are having lasting impact on the long-run future of the world in a way that will multiply out to the tens of trillions of people who might live after us and might really change the courts of history. And I think, I don't want to say that there's hundreds of thousands of organizations which are doing a really careful job of thinking about powerful things there, but I think that some of them are.Maybe to give one example of this, one thing that I think became really clear over the last few years, I guess, is that we as a society have no fucking clue what to do about pandemics. No matter what you think the right approach is, everyone agrees that we get optimistically a C plus I think, as a society for a response, and that's not restricted to one country. And I think as COVID drags on, even the countries that are thought to have done quite well on this, that starts to decay away a little bit. You see a lot of countries that did an amazing job of avoiding COVID, of not having many deaths from it, their economy stalled out though, because they didn't allow anyone else and they kind of shut down, and it's not clear what their path forward is now.Then you can ask a question of, well, what would it have taken for us to be in a much better place in response to COVID? I think there really are things we could have done that would've just been like super, super effective. What are sort of things there? I mean, first of all, it took us about a year after COVID hit before we were ready to start distributing vaccines. That's a really expensive year. That's basically, what? Probably like tens of trillions of dollars of economic damage and hundreds of thousands of lives lost. We didn't need to screw that up.Technologically, if we had been better prepared, we could've had vaccines cranking out two months maybe after COVID hit. People could've started getting doses February 2020 instead of November. And I think that's sort of a combination of early detection of new pandemics, having the infrastructure ready to start making vaccines, and having a less insane process for getting them legal. I mean, the amount of lives lost from delaying on certifying the vaccines is just absolutely enormous and the amount of economic damage done, and this is a very tractable problem. This isn't sort of some pie in the sky. Yeah, if we could solve all society's ills, that would be great. Patrick: It's kind of like you said with the risk model, is it getting better or not? Sam: Exactly. And now you look at the aftermath of this, and how much effort right now is society putting in to having a better response to the next pandemic than we had to this one? Zero. I don't know. Basically can't find talk about the next pandemic, which is pretty crazy, especially given that, frankly, we got a little bit lucky that COVID-19 wasn't more deadly than it turned out to be. There are probably ways to use your time and your money and your resources to get us way better prepared for the next pandemic in a way which has a shot at saving tens of trillions of dollars and millions of lives, and that's absolutely enormous.",1823
350,Sam Bankman-Fried - Creating a Perfect Market,Building a Perfect Market," Patrick: And that's just one example. So I'd love to turn the conversation now to markets. You mentioned the one example of, if we started this from scratch, it'd be 24/7, instant settlement, whatever. Walk me through what you think the key functions and building blocks are of a perfect market. So if we could design this without any frictions, no technological limitations, like let's work backwards from the end, what does the perfect state of markets look like? What are the key functions and blocks? Sam: I think I'm going to answer a very slightly different question, which is, what would it take to get within 5% of perfection or something like that? What would it take to get markets which are pretty close to the perfect one in ultimate value? And I think that that's a useful framework to think of. And maybe just to start with one example question, what latency do we need? How low does the latency need to be in a market, in an exchange, plus all the infrastructure that the market data connects to in order to basically get the most of the economic value out of it? And I think the answer is that the latency has to be low compared to the release rate of new economic information.What you want to avoid is a case where two different economic events happen, and there hasn't been time to internalize the first. And what speed is that at? I mean, it's at a really wide variety of speeds. But I think that realistically speaking, by the time you're at milliseconds, you've basically got there. You don't usually really have two pieces of significant different economic information coming out less than a millisecond away from each other, but you absolutely do have two in the same day and two in the same hour. And so I think that gives you some sense of, what latency do you need markets to have? The answer is less than an hour, certainly. And obviously it's hilariously long compared to the latency that NYSE and NASDAQ were playing, but that's being a little bit deceptive. Right now, yeah, NYSE's latency is a fraction of a millisecond, but in five hours, it's going to be tens of hours. It's going to be closed overnight. Right now, it might be a federal holiday, so it might not, I don't know if our markets- Patrick: Yeah. We're not even trading right now, yeah. Sam: Right. Microseconds plus or minus hours. Patrick: Or days on the weekend. Sam: Or days. It's sort of insane. I think this interesting context of, I don't think that it's the most important thing to really get the architecture to be as low latency as possible, but I think having it always open is actually pretty important. So I think that's one piece of it. Maybe going through some other things, here's an easy win; you know what I think should be free and publicly-available? The fucking order book. How insane is it that if you're not willing to shell out tens of millions of dollars a year right now, you're supposed to trade blind into an order book you're not allowed to see that the other players are. That's a pretty weird property of exchanges.Large market data fees are pretty weird. You had to choose a single thing to not be monetized in exchanges, I think you'd say the order book. Literally displaying what the order book is right now is the whole purpose of exchanges in some sense, other than allowing for trading, is to support price discovery. Not price discovery for those willing to pay 50 million a year. Patrick: Just describe how that works right now, that 50 million, like who's paying that and how that works in traditional markets. Sam: It's a mess. I mean, who's paying it? Well, the people directly connecting to an exchange's market data are literally paying it. If you're a sophisticated HFT firm, then you're paying it. But if you're a retail, then probably some data feed firm is paying it, which is then passing that cost onto some broker, which is then passing that cost onto you or something like that. But you probably also, if you're retail don't even get to see the order book, they'll only tell you the best bid and best offer. If you're lucky, maybe only the last traded price, maybe with five minutes delay or something, depending on how much they want to pay. Totally different in different cases. But if you really want all the data, you're paying the exchange tens of millions of dollars a year for this. And that's what all sophisticated trading firms have to do. You can't be like a sophisticated trading firm without doing this, at least for them major exchanges. And it is tens of millions, and maybe more than that in some cases.And if you're retail, you don't get most of the information and you pay so much for random fees and they just jack up your trading fees to compensate for this. And what's going on here, I think, is when you look at the monetization of a typical equities exchange today, it's a little weird. So in crypto, we are used to all the revenue coming from fees on transactions. That is not true on equities exchanges, and a lot of the reason for this is they're commoditizable in terms of the trading. If NYSE started instituting a five basis point beyond trades, everyone would just use NASDAQ. There's no reason really to choose one instead of the other, because all they are is a matching engine. That's their whole function. You just plug into a different matching engine.So the only thing they have which is really proprietary is their data. So they end up monetizing that. And what's going on here is the same company doesn't own the mobile app and the matching engine. All the trading fees end up in the mobile lab and the various brokerages and prime brokers and clearing and all the shit that happens in between the user and the exchange and the PFOF firms and everything else, the exchanges get served with those fees, and then they monetize their data, which everyone actually needs to pay for even if they're not trading. It doesn't matter if you want to go use NASDAQ instead of NYSE, you still need to know NASDAQ's data. You still need to know what's happening in markets to be able to actually efficiently price things.So odd business model, and is probably the wrong one for efficient markets. That's one area where I think the United States at least could stand to improve quite a bit. Also, just the user experience is really bad. Let's say that you want to buy Apple on NASDAQ, everyone, if they hadn't actually tried to do this before, will tell you the same thing about what you do, like go to nasdaq.com and try and create an account, and that doesn't work. You can't even see the order on nasdaq.com. You can't do that. You got to go find E-Trade or something and go in this giant ... So the amount of intermediation is insane in equities markets, and this leads to other weird things.One of the most popular things to do right now is to shit on people. A lot of politicians and regulators are taking a skeptical eye towards payment for ... I'm going to not take a position on it myself here. I think it's pretty similar to other things that you could do for better or for worse, but let's talk about why PFOF exists in the first place. It exists because you're forcing people to go through six different companies from start to finish between like the mobile app, some clearer custody, some ATS, ultimately ending up on some equities exchange. There's some prime brokers sitting in the middle there. Between each of these steps, there has to be a PFOF firm gluing things together. What sits between the retail customer and the mobile app, someone showing prices. But then that's not the exchange, that still has to get regurgitated onto the exchange and maybe onto a few layers.So you start to have these PFOF firms intermediating because you have all these other intermediaries that need pricing, connecting them together, and that makes it further messy and complicated. So I think creating clean, simple market infrastructures that are modular, but that don't require more parties than should be necessary is pretty valuable. And also you ask, why are none of these 24/7? Well, there's a lot of reasons, and one of them is you have to apply to the SEC and blah, blah, blah. But one of them is, let's say some random equities exchange goes 24/7 tomorrow. Robinhood's not going to be ready to support that. Whatever clearing firm people are using isn't going to be ready to support that. The stock loan businesses aren't going to be ready to support that. It's really hard to innovate if there's a lot of other companies that are intimately involved in every single transaction that you're doing. Patrick: There's a weakest link component or something? Sam: Exactly, that's right. You could take a step forward in something, it doesn't do anything unless everyone can coordinate. So it's another area where things could be substantially more efficient than they are today. What are other things here? And I mentioned these before, but when you talk about the finances here, I think having trading fees is pretty reasonable as a revenue model, but they have to be reasonable trading fees. And what does that mean? It means that they shouldn't be bigger than the amount of actual edge that firms are seeing. It shouldn't be so big that real economic moves get lost in the trading fee.If you charge, just as an extreme thing, 10% trading fees to everyone who trades, then there could be economic moves that move markets 5% and no trades will happen and no order books will update, because it's not worth anyone paying 10% fees just because markets went up 5. Jesus, bear went up 5%. What does that mean? It means, I don't know, what's the right unit of market moves that are economically relevant? In equities, I think a basis point is the answer. I mean, I'm making that up, nothing magical about that. But I think if markets have moved less than a basis point, it's fair to say the world hasn't really changed. And if they've moved many basis points, I think it's fair to say- Patrick: Something's going on. Sam: Yeah, exactly. And so, I think what that means is if you're running an equities exchange and you want to have trading fees, what's a reasonable fee? A basis point. I think that's a reasonable fee, somewhere between a 10th of a basis point and two basis points or something. As soon as you get much beyond that, you're killing trades, you're killing liquidity. And we see that some countries have 10, 15, 20 basis point taxes on every trade. That is bigger than effective economic move, and equity might not even move 20 basis points in an entire session.And if you're charging 20 bits on both sides as a fee, they won't trade. And you really do see massive decreases in liquidity and volume. And it's a lot harder to raise money and it's a lot harder to get efficient pricing and market moves in venues where the taxes plus fees are more than a couple bits. And so I think that's another thing which is important for efficient markets is that the fees are reasonable. And when I say the fees, I don't just mean the matching-engine fees. I mean every fee from start to finish in a trade, the total net fees that are paid when one party passes an asset onto the other, shouldn't really exceed a few basis points. Patrick: If we go back to the order-book concept, maybe it would be helpful, since it's already happening and you were on that side of the business prior to crypto, to explain why those HFT firms are buying that data? And what having full order-book data, the depth of the order book, the specifics of it, allows for relative to a retail trader that has none of those things? Why is that valuable? What would it mean for it to be open, based on what's happening when it's not open? Sam: Basically it's pointing to a bunch of things which are all somewhat related to each other. Which is the value of market data, and there's maybe two different things. So, one is complete market data, and the other is fast market data. One thing when you look at actually being able to see the order book versus just the last traded price, the order book probably updates you a basis point or two, about your fair for something beyond just knowing the last price that it traded at. If it last traded at 123.58, you see that there's a gigantic bid at 123.58 and the best offer is 123.61. You probably don't think 123.58 is fair. You probably think it's 123.60. One piece of this is just, yeah, there's probably about a basis point update on average from having full market data versus having minimal market data. And again, I think that's not the biggest deal in the world, but it's economically relevant: a factor that matters.And obviously if you're an HFT firm, it's a norm. That's more than the whole game. You have no choice but to pay all the data fees if you want to be a big HFT firm. But if you're not paying those data fees, you're always going to be a basis point worse than everyone else, which means that you can never do trades that are barely good, or do trades which are short time-scale. Stop only doing trades which you think are good by very large amounts. Which is fine for a long term investor. I don't think this matters if you're looking at somebody who's trying to buy $20 million of some equity and hold it for a year. It does mean that only people shelling out tens of millions can be involved in precise or short-term price discovery.The other thing that you got to, that you pointed out there is looking at PFOF firms. The whole thing is complicated and it all gets bundled into one fee and they don't say, oh yeah, well, we paid this many cents for this reason, and we tacked on this many cents for that reason. But at its core, there two things going on there. The first is just traditional liquidity. First is like, yeah, sure. I'll sell you shares of Tesla on the offer right now. That's better than my fare, which is about midpoint. And that's part of what PFOF firms are doing is the effective price that they show post fees is often just a little bit more skewed to the side they want. They make whatever happen on that.The other thing though, which you pointed at, is that they're buying data and what does that mean? Well, it means that, let's say, that Bob comes in to buy a share of Apple and it routed straight to a PFOF firm. And they're asked for a price on it and they do the trade. They now know that Bob, or that someone, they don't know Bob's identity maybe, but they know someone, and they know where the work came from, so they probably know what Bob looks like. They probably can guess whether he's a day trader or whether he's a long term investor or an asset manager, just bought a little bit of Apple. They know that and the rest of the world does not yet know that. Maybe they have some trade reporting duties, but probably that's seconds later. So this is often misunderstood as front running that particular order. Which in general people don't do and absolutely should not do.Where if they hear that Bob wants to buy a share of Apple and they go frantically try and buy Apple and then show a quote to Bob. But they don't need to do that because work flow is so correlated that if you know before everyone else does that Bob just bought a share of Apple from you. You settle on the price with him. You now have this information about the direction of flow and no one else does. And that's where you might get firms which are willing to do a trade which would otherwise be bad, or at least not make any money. Because really what you're doing is you're buying yourself 20 seconds of prior warning that retail traders are starting to buy some stock or something like that.",3617
351,Sam Bankman-Fried - Creating a Perfect Market,Fairness in Crypto Markets," Patrick: So we've got this really cool, big umbrella concept, price discovery, and clear prices are at the root of market capitalism. And it's one of the key markets, therefore one of the key mechanisms that make capitalism interesting, at least historically. And then we've got this migration, that maybe crypto markets represent, towards closer to that perfect end state of always on, open order book, more egalitarian, et cetera.I want to talk now about fairness. So there's a fairness spectrum where you could argue that mono electronic markets and stock market let's say is fairly fair in the sense that there's reg FD, there's all sorts of regulations around who gets to see what information when. And then obviously in the crypto world, it's sort of wild west still. Meaning there's all sorts of the equivalent of insider information and front running and all this other stuff. Tell me about the state of fairness in crypto markets today. How do you assess it? How are you trying to work on it? Sam: So, the first thing that I think is most important, frankly, and I think it's under emphasized in these discussions, the most important thing is transparency about how much transparency there is. The most important thing is that everyone is on the same page about what the market structure looks like. The most destructive thing is if everyone believes that front running is illegal and then someone goes in and front runs. Because then everyone made a lot of decisions conditional on one set of rules for the game and just get blown out by the defectors. So the most important thing is that everyone in the market knows what they're dealing with.And the other thing is actually having a level playing field to start with. When you look at crypto today, it is a total mess. It's a lot less of mess than it was three years ago. So it was an even bigger mess then. Just to give some numbers here, in late 2017/early 2018, a lot of Japanese residents got very excited about crypto, actually a lot of countries, but Japan particularly so. And if a lot of Japanese residents got excited about Apple and they found a way to buy Apple stock, what would that mean? It would mean Apple stock goes up probably. It doesn't exactly cause market inefficiencies or dislocations or trades or anything like that. What does it mean when they got really excited about Bitcoin? Well, Bitcoin went up, but it particularly meant that it went up a lot in Japan. And that is a notion which is foreign to- Patrick: Global markets. Sam: Right. I mean, there's Reg NMS in the US, which prohibits arbitrage between different equities exchanges. In general, there's not a market for everything and everyone uses basically that market. And there's lots of capital keeping things at least mostly in line with that. In crypto, not even a little bit. There's no natural forces that make it need to be the case that a Bitcoin is worth the same amount on every venue. And in fact, in late 2017/early 2018, if you were trying to buy Bitcoin in Japan, you would end up paying about 10% more than if you were buying it in the United States.There was an absolutely massive arbitrage. You just never see numbers like that. You could spend your life trading equities, 10% arbitrage is just not a concept. And it's trading a billion dollars a day. Patrick: Not small, not a liquidity problem. Sam: What's happening there? Well, there's no formal regulatory relationship between the Japanese exchange and the US exchange. But in addition to that, there's whatever, a 100, 200 million of net flow per day coming probably from Japan. How much money was there providing to that? Well, in late 2017, less than a hundred million dollars a day. None of the large liquidity writers were in this space, it was actually very difficult to provide liquidity to that arbitrage. You had to get banking setup that was crypto friendly in Japan and the United States. You had to get accounts, you had to get capital, it was a massive production. The amount of total liquidity that people had gotten effectively set up there was less than the total demand. The market just diverged. And stayed diverged for months. That's an extreme example and we don't see things that extreme anymore. But that's the example of a thing that could happen in crypto. You could have Coinbase trading a percent higher than Gemini for Bitcoin for a week straight.If somehow there's so much flow on one of them and not the other, and not enough liquidity trying to keep those in line. And that will happen when crypto markets get stressed. So when there's a big move, you'll start to see some arbitrages appear again for a bit. What this means is that basically the active traders are getting bad prices. What this means is that if you want to sell your Bitcoin during a crash, you might end up losing an extra percent or two on it because you're selling it where everyone else is selling it. And you're selling it below what a Bitcoin's actually worth. At the moment, because there isn't enough buy side liquidity providing to it, things are more in line than they used to be. If you take a major crypto currency right now, it's probably within two basis points on most major exchanges. It's not a huge loss that you're facing. But there are a lot of idiosyncratic times where that number gets bigger.And what is driving that? One, no Reg NMS, no anti-arbitrage principles. Number two, not enough total liquidity in the space. Just the market makers aren't big enough compared to the flow. And number three, a lot of assets that are a little bit funky. An example of this is Tether. A lot of people have disagreed on whether Tether is a dollar or whether it's kind of like a dollar, but not really. Reasonable people have decided it's worth a dollar, reasonable people have decided it's worth 99 cents. Reasonable people sometimes decide it's worth a dollar and a penny. Now, all of a sudden you have a 1% spread or arbitrage potentially popping up, if different people are pricing it a Tether differently.And so you see things like that that can lead to discrepancies here. You can see just exchange problems, like with an exchange that's having tech problems accepting deposits of a cryptocurrency, that might trade way too high on that exchange. Because no one can get it there to sell. And one of the things that exacerbates this is is in many places, including crucially the United States, there's effectively no leverage emerging or financing to anyone in crypto. And what that means is that if you physically run out of dollars, if you're a market maker and you run out of dollars on Bitstamp, and there's a big seller, you'd be like, yeah, it'll be a day, a day before I can buy another Bitcoin here. I have to wait for a wire transfer to land. If you're allowed to use margin, you can imagine basically margin buying there against selling somewhere else. And then closing that spread down when the wire transfer is through the next day. With no margin, you can't do that.And so, unless you want to have $10 million sitting there in your Bitstamp account doing nothing most of the time, when you get someone who's trying to sell $10 million of Bitcoin, you can't provide to them. You can only provide how much you have there. And so that is another contributing factor to the capital cost of providing liquidity in crypto, especially across venues. And because of that, the inefficiencies that you can see across markets that can last from anywhere from a second to a week day. Patrick: It makes me think back, in that example, of the problem of relying on all this different chain of firms, these intermediaries, to make anything progress better. Does that mean the same is basically said here, but with fiat systems or ramps as the same problem, again, crypto can only go as fast as the fiat system keeps up or something? Sam: To some extent, yes. It is legitimately the case that sometimes the hardest thing about buying a cryptocurrency is sending a wire transfer. Even though it's supposed to be a non fiat system, the places where that seeps in still end up being the hardest. And the biggest blocker, when I was first getting set up in crypto, that was the biggest blocker, I spent two weeks, I had some dollars in my bank account and it's like, I would like a Bitcoin please? Took me two weeks.Why it took me two weeks? Sending that wire transfer's legit hard. The banks don't want to deal with it. Wire transfers don't work very well. That's a huge pain. What else is causing pains here? Well, maybe I should say is there a way around this really? Because there is. There is a way to potentially at least partially ameliorate this, which is Stablecoin. This is the beautiful thing about Stablecoins. 24/7, they're on the blockchain. So if everyone in the crypto industry used USDC, instead of USD, that you can move 24/7, that you can move instantly. And that removes the reliance on wire transfers. And that's one of the reasons why Stablecoins are so big in crypto, it's just legitimately an easier and better way. Patrick: Where does that fall down though? We don't have to go into the Tether dispute, it's just too complicated for our conversation today. But if Tether is a dollar, let's just say it's a digital dollar that moves like you want it to, itself has the same problem. It needs some sort of backing or collateral which moves at the old speed. So how does that work? Sam: The way it works, the advantage that you get from it is that sometimes you don't need to go into a bank account. Let's say you're trying to just send your dollars from PointBase to Bitstamp. You in theory could just send USDC from Pointbase to Bitstamp.If there's no Stablecoin, you have to wire it out from PointBase to your bank account, and then in from your bank account to Bitstamp. So it's the wiring in and wiring out where you're not actually trying to cash out, but it's the only way to move it around. So the advantage of Stablecoins is when you're not trying to exit the crypto ecosystem, you're just trying to move within it. And so you don't need to do the creation and redemption of the Stablecoin you sent there. But yeah, if you're trying to pay a bill- Patrick: You got a problem, yeah. Sam: It doesn't help. Sure, you could buy Stablecoin say for a dollar, but then you just have to go redeem that Stablecoin. And now you're back at the same old place of needing a wire transfer. Patrick: Do you have a sense for how much fiat inflow relative to market value there's been in the crypto ecosystem? And how do you see that trending over time? I, is there a point at which there's an escape velocity here? Sam: I've thought about this. I don't know the answer, but let's get some bounds on this. And the thing lurking here, right now, crypto market cap is 2.5 trillion or something like that. That does not mean that people have wired $2.5 trillion into crypto to buy. Because as you buy, crypto price goes up, and everyone's crypto appreciates, not just the crypto you just purchased. But let's get some bounds on it. So there's something like a hundred billion dollars of Stablecoins outstanding. That I think is a lower bound on the amount of fiat inflows that led to that $2.5 trillion of market cap.In addition to that I'm guessing there's another hundred billion of fiat currency sitting on exchanges. That's a few hundred billion. And then there's some other places that aren't going to be as easily tracked as that. What's my guess? Eh, I don't know, $400 or $500 billion or so of actual legitimate fiat inflows that have gone into this space. So something like 25% of the market cap, 20% of the market cap, I don't know, something like that. Which doesn't seem like an insane ratio to me. I don't really know what to think a fair one is. But I don't know, seems plausible.What's going to change that ratio? Well, right now everyone knows that most financial institutions are planning to buy Bitcoin at some point, somehow, maybe on their own behalf, maybe on their investors' behalf, their clients. If you talk to basically any big bank, pension fund, doesn't matter what, they'll all say the same thing, which is yes, we have a mandate, not just a green light, but a mandate, to get involved in the crypto ecosystem. They will also almost all say, but we're not ready yet. We have a mandate to do it, but compliance is going to take somewhere between six and 24 months. Patrick: Compliance, custody, all this stuff, yeah. Sam: Basically substantial expected fiat inflows into the crypto ecosystem over the next few years, which haven't really materialized yet, but probably will. That is something that could really fill out the capital base of crypto and start to get those dollars into the ecosystem, make the capital in the ecosystem to market cap ratio get closer to one. Patrick: Does that necessarily mean that prices go up if more fiat comes into the system? Sam: Probably but not necessarily. Patrick: Why would it not? Sam: If it's over pre-positioned. So I don't think this is really happening, but to some extent you could imagine, maybe the world has expected $200 billion of inflows from institutional players over the next three years. And in fact there's going to be $50 billion of inflows. And the world has already bought a $100 billion in anticipation of that, planning to flip out to the inflows. But in fact, there's only 50 of them. So the flip people are going to be selling a hundred, trying to flip out to inflows of only 50, net selling prices go down. I wouldn't guess that would be what happened, I would guess that people are under pre-positioned for it, but you could imagine.",3240
352,Sam Bankman-Fried - Creating a Perfect Market,Attractions of Building in Crypto," Patrick: So you came late to this ecosystem, and I don't mean the word mercenary in a negative way at all, but in a world that was previously filled with so many pure missionaries, like zealots for crypto as the solution to everything, which I wouldn't characterize you as that. Because you had this late, relatively speaking late, and pragmatic view on this entire space. What has you so excited? Why have you devoted your time and attention, which we talked about at the beginning, you're allocating meaningfully for some larger goal. What is it about this ecosystem that has attracted you and so many other talented people, and do you anticipate staying in it a long time? Sam: There are a bunch of things leading to that. First of all, just huge, huge demand in this space and not enough supply. And I need that on many levels. I've met that historically in terms of buying versus selling crypto currencies. It's still today the case that one thing you can look at for instance, is, I don't know, on FTX, which is the crypto exchange I started, we have a [bought] borrow lending book, where there's market forces determining the interest rates of the various assets. And right now, if you want to borrow a Bitcoin, which you can use to short sell, you're paying a little bit less than a percent a year in interest. Then there's $700 million of open interest there. If you want to borrow a dollar, which you could use to get long crypto, you're paying 10% a year, and there is $2 billion of open interest.So this is still the case today that there's more demand to buy cryptocurrency than there is supply of dollars in the space to buy cryptocurrency. But I also mean this in terms of infrastructure, there's huge demands being placed on all the infrastructure in crypto and not enough supply of great infrastructure. And that ratios off by a sort of a comical amount, especially rewind a few years, exchanges were crashing daily because they couldn't handle the load, risk engines were incinerating a million dollars a day of customer funds because they couldn't margin call on time. It was a total fucking mess because it was massive, massive interest, demand, excitement, capital volume in the crypto industry. And it just hadn't had time to mature enough for the infrastructure to catch up with that. So one part of this is just like business opportunity. It seems like there's a lot of demand for a new business here and someone's got to do it.And it didn't seem like the existing players were going to get their act together. Another piece of this is, you pointed this out, when I first tried to do a crypto trade, the hardest part of the crypto trade was the wire transfer. And I think that's super instructive for me. I think what it sort of made me think was, wow, the existing financial infrastructure we have has some issues. Patrick: Sucks. Sam: Somehow, despite the fact that this space seems like a total shit show, it still is actually easier to use than a bank. And there's obvious ways to make this space a lot more efficient. And so it just sort of felt like, yeah, boy, payments must be real bad. And when you sort of start to dig into it, it's like, yeah, they are. We often don't notice it, but we're bleeding 3% of our GDP each year to payments. Every time you go to a supermarket and buy a banana, you're paying 3% to a credit card company to cover up the fact payments don't really work. You're trying to wire money to Nigeria, you're losing tens of percents. And I think that there's just substantial opportunities to start fresh, the natively digital and natively online approach. The nice thing about decentralized lectures is that it allows international cooperation, it allows cooperation between companies on sending value between each other. There's a lot of economic opportunity in crypto rails. And when you look at the potential of something like DeFi, here's one cool thing you can do with DeFi. You could put social networks on chain.What does that mean? It means you build a protocol on chain for sending encrypted messages. Maybe they're DMs, maybe they're public, depending on whatever setting you choose. Every social network could draw from that same protocol, that same set of messages. What that means is that if you tweet, someone else can like it on Facebook, because they're both accessing that same underlying set of messages and that same underlying protocol, that's extremely valuable. It solves this network issue where no one wants to use a social media company and tell all their friends are using it. So it makes them interoperable with each other. And it also allows cool approaches to censorship, have a permissionless underlying protocol layer, and then anyone can build their own user interface on top of that and can make their own decisions about whether to censor it.And if you're sort of upset with the censorship level on some platform, you can start your own and you already have access to all the messages that are floating through there. So I think that sort of like is another example, a pretty cool application of blockchain tech, which I think could actually be better than the existing products, but would take a lot of work to build out. Patrick: Obviously you're sequencing. You don't strike me as an accidental guy. And so the sequencing is very interesting, starting with Almeda, which is a trading firm explicitly trying to earn profits in a inefficient market, which has gone very well. Then it's FTX and Serum. And like you said, infrastructure in this space. Talk to me about sequencing. My suspicion is not done and we'll keep sequencing in other directions. How do you think about that challenge of what to do when and when to do next? Sam: A lot of this has to be dynamic because a lot of this has to be super responsive to the global environment. Right now, if you're a crypto company and you're not thinking extremely hard about regulation and compliance, you're making a mistake. I don't think it was as obvious a year ago. I mean, a year ago, a lot of crypto companies didn't really have compliance departments. I think we thought it was a little bit predictable that that would run into problems and that some people being a little bit out there. There is some responsiveness here, but putting that aside, what are the next steps? I'll give a few and I don't want to say these are definitely the next steps. I think what I would say is these are steps that we are very strongly considering and, or working towards, but we'll decide dynamically what the right thing to prioritize is.So one of them, and I mean, this is something where I think we've basically laid our cards on the table. Let's just get some statistics from today. By the way, crypto trades a lot. I think some people underestimate this. Crypto trades almost as much as US equities do. It's a lot of volume. So in the last day there's been about $200 billion of volume globally in crypto. If you want to divide that up, internationally, it's about $130 billion of derivatives volume and something like $55 billion of spot volume. So a little more than two to one.And now let's look at the United States. So in the US, there's something like $10 billion of spot volume, $1.5 billion of derivatives volume. So the ratio rather than being like two and a half to one, it's 0.1 to one. And if you sort of extrapolate out, there is something like $25 billion of missing volume right now, which should be derivatives volume coming from the United States. That's big. If you had that and nothing else that would make you the second biggest exchange globally. And why is that? It's because no major crypto exchanges are CFTC licensed. None of them have the regulatory ability to offer futures in the United States. We recently acquired Ledger X. It's a CFTC-licensed, crypto derivatives platform. It's pretty straightforward what we want to do with that. And we're really excited to work with the CFTC on that and to talk about ways to develop that platform over time. But that's just a massive, massive missing market.",1801
353,Sam Bankman-Fried - Creating a Perfect Market,Regulatory Environments and Policy," Patrick: Before we go on, just a broader question on countries competing with regulatory environment for economic activity. If you think about the US's history, you could argue that its success was its system settings, the rule of law and the declaration of independence, everything that was the agreed upon rules, to use your point earlier, was what made this such an amazing place to do business and remains an amazing place to do business. How do you think about that in this new kind of Web 3 world where it seems like perhaps the US is on the wrong side of what made it so great historically? Is that true? Do you think that will change? How do you think about countries competing with regulatory environments for this new industry? Sam: I'm optimistic it will change. And I think the biggest thing is crypto came about very quickly and how new it is. This isn't like it's a new type of CME future with a different index. Patrick: Right. Sam: This is a totally new settlement layer. It's a totally new asset class. It's a totally new role. It's a really profoundly different product. Five years ago, had very little attention. And so in five years, a very, very different asset class has been born and become as large as largest existing asset classes in volume. That's pretty wild. That's faster than regulatory systems move in most countries. And see what's happening in the United States, the US does not generally try and roll out completely new financial regulatory frameworks every three to five years. This is like breakneck pace on that standard. And I think that that's a lot of what's been caught here is right now, there are real interesting questions about what the framework will be for a lot of assets.What regulatory department has jurisdiction over them? What licenses will ultimately end up being necessary for some action? And that's not say that there's confusion over everything. There is clarity around some things in the US regulatory space, but there are other things where there isn't, and it's a big topic of discussion. If you talk to someone on Capitol Hill right now, ask about what their views are on finance, a third of what they'll tell you about crypto. This is top of mind for regulators. I'm optimistic that there's going to be sort of fuller frameworks built out over the next few years in the US that will make it a much more robust place to do crypto business. Patrick: How do you think about the centralized nature of most regulation historically that it's far easier to regulate, say, bank charters and a limited number of them, than a decentralized ledger and the decentralized ledger provides so many of the interesting properties. There's this weird tension here between what you can regulate, whether it's the exchanges or the wallets, or whatever it might be, what the right point is, that seem to naturally have to then centralize versus the benefits of a decentralized ledger. How do you square this circle in terms of innovation? Sam: I have some thoughts, but I don't know what the answer will ultimately be. And I do think that's something that regulators are very much struggling with and trying to figure out how to approach, what could you do there? Well, here's one example. I think a reasonable thing to do is to try to find strategic parts of the ecosystem, to put the bulk of the regulation in. And as an example, I think centralized exchanges and anyone who's running a fiat to cryptocurrency conversion business is a really good place to start looking for, at the very least, anti-money laundering, anti-financial crimes regulation, and also market integrity regulation and things like that. I think with stablecoins, I don't know what the perfect approach is. Here's something which I think would be a substantial step forward from where we are. On the regulatory side without endangering the product would be a registration regime based around reporting and transparency, where you have to say exactly what assets you're holding.And there have to be QI audits confirming that, and you have to have policies around redemptions and honoring those, and maybe some blacklist for addresses known to be associated with financial crimes. Maybe the assets have to be held in a US bank account, some sort of regime like that, which I think would address a lot of the consumer protection and financial crimes worries that exist with some regulararies, with stablecoins, while still allowing the space to thrive. And I think that I almost explicit what we want to say. I don't know what the perfect thing is. I sort of think that's a really hard question and it depends on how the space develops over time, and rather than shooting for the perfect here, I think the right thing to do is take steps in the right direction. Start to build out frameworks that protect consumers, that prevent financial crimes without killing the industry, start with that, take steps forward.And then yeah, in three years, maybe there's going to be a second round of things. With a regime like that with stablecoins, that addresses most of the large points of concerns while allowing USD stablecoins to thrive, which I think is really valuable from the economic efficiency perspective for the crypto ecosystem. Also, frankly, for like dollar dominant. There are going to be stablecoins in the world. And if you ban USD stablecoins, then it's going to be Euro coins or be CNY stablecoins. It's not a question of whether there will be stablecoins. It's a question of which country they come from and which currency they're backed by.",1201
354,Sam Bankman-Fried - Creating a Perfect Market,Importance of Derivatives," Patrick: I was going to go back to why derivatives are such a key function just in general, maybe this is an overly simplistic question, but the ratio internationally makes me think, look, this is just a key central function that we need in properly functioning markets. And you've done a lot, obviously you've spent your career kind of in this space. What is it about derivatives for the uninitiated that are so important for markets? Sam: One thing to note, which I think you're sort of alluding to there, is that this isn't a crypto-specific thing. In almost every asset class, more volume trades in derivatives and spot, and why is that? If you don't need delivery, they're more economically efficient. The big thing about... Let's just compare a futures contract with spot contract. In order for Alice to buy a Bitcoin from Bob, Alice needs dollars sitting there on the exchange and Bob needs a physical Bitcoin sitting there on the exchange for that transaction happen. Now that's very important if Alice's goal to go send that Bitcoin to her friend or if Bob's goal is to go take those dollars and pay his bills with it. But most volume doesn't actually require physical delivery. Most of the volume that you look at, it's people trading in and out. It's people putting on a position that they want, people hedging something the average trade doesn't require.It's not actually important to either person to get physically delivered the thing. That's the financial exposure that they're looking for. And frankly, you can trade out of that later, if you need to. If you buy a Bitcoin future, but later decide you need the Bitcoin, you can later go sell that Bitcoin future against buying a spot Bitcoin to get into that. But if you don't require delivery, which is what happens with futures, that's just your financial transaction, you don't require nearly as many specific types of assets sitting on the right people's accounts in the right place at the right time in order to do a transaction. People instead trade freely as long as they have enough total collateral that they're not going to blow out and then figure out settlement on their own schedules. It just makes markets more efficient. It makes them easier to use. It lowers transaction costs. It lowers capital requirements and people could trade with spot if they had to. They usually don't want to, usually if they prefer not to, because it just, yeah, you end up paying twice as high fees and you're often unable to do the trade you want to do. Patrick: You're in the space, obviously. So I'm curious what you think the competitive frontiers are between derivatives exchanges. So if five derivatives exchanges are competing for your business, what are the battle between them to win over the user's business? Sam: Dank memes on Twitter. Patrick: It's funny but true. Sam: Right, if you want to ignore things that most influence people's decision making and said, ""Look, sort the underlying products,"" which is not the direction this world has been going in, but sure. Sort of an antiquated thing, but probably still quite important. Here's one thing, cross margining. So let's say that you want to buy your own early future. What do you need to have in your account, and where, in order to do that? On FTX, the answer is anything. You can have anything in your account and you just have one account. There's no... Where is not a meaningful thing. You deposit euros, dollars, Ethereum, Bitcoin, Heather,USDC, Microsoft, Spy. Any of those work as collateral. Compute is collateral value or credit, to the extent it's larger illiquid and make sure that your position doesn't exceed its bounds and you trade whichever futures you want, in whatever combination you want.On some other platforms, what does it look like? Well, the only way to do this is to sell whatever you have. Tether use tethered to buy spot Ethereum, move your Ethereum into your Ethereum futures margin wallet, and use that as collateral, straight Ethereum future. So first of all, they require you to trade spots, trade futures, it defeats the whole point of futures. Second of all, you then want to go buy a Bitcoin future, tough luck. You move your Ethereum out, sell it for tether, use your tether to buy Bitcoin, move the Bitcoins into your Bitcoin futures margin wallet. You're literally managing hundreds of thousands of wallets on a single platform, moving assets, doing stupid spot trades to have the right collateral in the right place at the right time. It's this massive mini game that doesn't need to exist. It increases risk and get liquidated on any one of them. You have no flexibility on it. The whole system is a mess. And so that's, I think, one of the biggest differences is how cross-collateralized the margin system is.",1079
355,Sam Bankman-Fried - Creating a Perfect Market,"Brand, Blockchains, and Personal Beliefs"," Patrick: Back to Dank memes on Twitter. One of the things that's interesting, and I'm just curious, because again, it seems like you make decisions in a very rational way. You spend a lot of money on marketing. I see FTX all over the place and in the obvious places where your users might be, how do you think about that? Like paid acquisition in this world, it's such a traditional concept, marketing dollars. It seems very non-crypto in some ways. How do you process a decision like this and prosecute it? Sam: There's a really interesting question of whether we should be buying Facebook ads or Google ads. Right now we're not really. And I don't know if it's right not to be, but let's put that aside for a second because that's usually what user acquisition means. Frankly speaking, most of this money is usually spent on square that says, ""Buy X here,"" a big buy button, click on it, it takes you to the website and that's not what we're doing. Why is it not? On the one hand, most user acquisition happens through social media. How did we get most of our users? They saw a post on Twitter and were like, ""Oh wow, this person, who's a picture of a frog, I generally think has good instincts on crypto products. And they said that FTX was really dope. So I should go test it out.""That is actually legitimately. A lot of communication happens in space. Yeah. We could buy Facebook ads. Doesn't really intersect with how most of our important customer acquisition actually happen. Now maybe this is a mistake. Maybe we're just missing out a lot because you're not doing it. But there's a second thing we're trying to do, I think much more than that, which is when you exit the core... Nothing that we're doing for marketing is going to matter for someone who spends five hours a day trading crypto. Those users have all looked at the major venues and we will win or lose them based on primarily our product. But if you're someone who spends five hours a year, thinking about crypto- Patrick: Brand matters now. Sam: Right. You're not trying out 10 products. You're not clear you're trying out two products. Hey, it might just be one. So name recognition certainly matters. And we're way behind on that. Versus for instance, Coinbase, we have about four times their daily trading volume and about 3% of their user base. So it's a factor of 100 difference in volume per user. They have done spectacularly at the long tail retail consumer, and we have done much better at the more sophisticated, more highly engaged users who trade larger volume each. But the other thing that matters, I sort of split out marketing into name recognition and brand. One thing that I think about with our marketing is, how do we get as many people as possible to have heard of us? And another is, how do we get people to know who we are, who we really are, to get some sense of that? And that's hard. That is the thing that we're really thinking about with our marketing.And a lot of the endorsements that we're doing are aimed at not just getting people to literally see the letters FTX somewhere, but to create a more powerful association and to convey that we're here for the long-term, we're a legitimate exchange, we're a legitimate product that people who have a lot of reputation to lose and don't want to lose it, have done a lot of research and due diligence on us. But more generally, we're looking to pack a lot more punch with a lot of the marketing that we're doing rather than spreading it out as much. What does that mean in practice? It means thinking about what are the few things in the world that really matter? And that really matter from a branding perspective or from an endorsement perspective? There just aren't that many.Look at basketball players. How many basketball players, if you heard that they had some association with a product, would that be like, ""Oh, that's kind of interesting?"" It's really a short list of things. And if you look at which endorsements matter for a sports team, there actually just aren't that many that matter that much. When you think about what properties of a sporting endorsement you have heard of and resonated with you, and you can remember. Patrick: The idea is then that you want to be extremely choosy on quality and impact. And that that's an interesting optimization challenge just in and of itself. I'm really enamored with the concept of the first part of the web being user-generated, content defined. And the next as being user-generated, asset defined, spin up NFTs, companies can issue tokens.And I'm curious how you think about this big trend. Like what opportunity it represents, how it will change the world. We could talk about the FTT token and its utility, if you want. What is your thought on this user-generated asset era that we may be entering and leaving an old era? Sam: Super interesting. It goes hand-in-hand with disintermediation, where a lot of these assets are things which in theory are sort of user-generated and sort of always have been, but only in theory.As an example, how about a book? Are books user-generated content? I mean, yes, sort of. They're like author-generated content. But historically, what gatekeeps them? It's not demand and it's not supply. It's publishing houses and bookstores. And then all these things which take ultimately user-generated content, get it in the hands of consumers, but with a lot of weird distortion and a lot of weird bottlenecking and gatekeeping.And now, what are we starting to see? More and more people self-publishing an ebook. And saying like, ""Wait, I can upload a PDF to my blog. And now I've published a book, I guess."" So much for getting an agent, trying to publisher. And I think we're not quite there yet for a mass market, but I think we probably will be. And it can reflect on like, what is the role of a publishing house?I think that we are seeing that shift in a lot of areas. I think that sometimes it's all at once and sometimes it's bit by bit, but it used to be the case that when people were trying to decide what companies to buy, they would all outsource it to the same seven asset managers, mutual funds, pension funds. And that's what moved markets. Still happens to some extent, but a lot of people take it into their own hands and they go on social media, they make decisions about what companies to buy and they buy them.And it's a very different dynamic. And you get some things that look like more efficient markets and some things that look like less efficient markets. On the one hand you get AMC and GameStop and Hertz. On the other hand, I think, you get some companies where there is probably much faster price discovery because of this. I think Tesla's probably an example of that where that happened way faster than if the old institutions were gatekeeping it.And that's probably not the type of content you're thinking of, but I think it's the same phenomenon of people taking their lives into their own hands and the web enabling that. And so now you can talk about, ""Okay, well, how about real content content?"" Well, NFTs. That's user-generated content direct to consumer, with sort of lightweight platforms facilitating that transaction in a competitive market where you could choose a different platform if you wanted.How about tokens with different token economic models? In most countries in the world right now it's a flourishing industry. Not really in the United States because of questions around whether some of these are securities. You can look at user-built applications, which... Okay, that's what a startup is. But again, the amount of hassle and intermediation usually put into that is massive. Patrick: Very hard, high friction to start a company. Sam: High friction. You need to know the right VC firms to have a shot at getting the funding necessary. Now you see people from their basement starting an app online, and that's another variant on the same thing. And I think that ultimately, it's going to be good. I think ultimately, it disintermediates, it creates more efficient markets. It removes friction. It allows things to move much faster. It's also a little bit of a rocky road. It means that there isn't natural curation points and the world has to, in a somewhat ad hoc way, figure out how to do that. Patrick: If we think about some of the Layer-1 blockchains, Solana or whatever, Ethereum, probably the best two examples, as developer toolkits, more than anything else that address the problem you just laid out. You just get to get going right away, tomorrow, tonight, rather than go through the arduous process of starting a company. What does that mean in terms of how many of these Layer-1 blockchains there need to be? Like today, there's a couple dominant ones. What do you think? Sam: I don't see a reason there need to be two. That's not saying there won't be, but why do there need to be two? Why not one? It's not immediately obvious. And I think what I'd say is, right now, there should be many because there should be competition as platforms. There should be competition driving them all to keep getting better and driving the world to figure out which they want to use.I don't know for sure what the answer is going to be there, but I do think that the world is starting to understand better than they did before. I think you're starting to see a lot more sophisticated thinking than even six months ago about Layer-1s, where I think there's just some really obvious, important questions you have to be asking. What's the end game here? What's the end game that matters the most? What's a really important end game? The really important end game is a billion users using some blockchain, right? It's trillions of dollars using some blockchain.And what goes along with tens of trillions of dollars and billions of users? And you should just look at a lot of examples. The answer is millions of transactions per second. That's sort of how it is. And I think that just like you can't scale, if you're not going to get to millions, I think you sort of need to get to that level. And if you don't, you're almost preferably never going to be a big part of the picture in terms of actually facilitating the bulk of the economic activity or noneconomic activity happening on blockchains.So I think that's a incredibly important piece of this. And really the question is, how would you build infrastructure that can support that, and it's at least somewhat composable? So you don't want to take a single order book and shard it. That doesn't work. Two people trying to lift the same offer at the same time, it's a mess. In fact, a single exchange shard did pretty bad. So I think you need a hundred thousand TPS per shard eventually.And really within an industry, you don't want to break composability. You want to be able to seamlessly move capital between one application and another one that are both financial trading applications. I think you're starting to look at something like a million TPS per natively composable, single-shard, single-thread unit. And maybe you have to shard it after that, or use Layer-2s or side chains or whatever you want to call them.But I think you want to maximize how much you can get into one composable blockchain first. And I think you want to shoot for a million or so. My honest sense here is that, it's a lot of values in getting a single, natively composable, million TPS blockchain. Patrick: You vote with your wallet or with your code. And you've built on top of Solana. Probably no surprise to people listening that that's the one with the most transactions per second and scalability in that way. What does that mean, you think about Bitcoin? So much of this ecosystem is still Bitcoin, obviously that is not the play... Bitcoin is not the developer tool that anyone would want it to be. It doesn't support any of what you just said. So how do you think about the original asset in this space that got the whole thing going? Sam: I don't think of it as a general purpose blockchain. But as you said, it's got what five, ten TPS. That is not enough to be general purpose medium for exchange. What it does let you do though, is move Bitcoins around. And that's sort of my sense. The point of the Bitcoin blockchain is to move Bitcoins around. It's not to facilitate general financial aids .And see then I think that question speaks on general , how cool is Bitcoin as an asset set. And I think that is what I think has potentially a large role in the world. And I don't want to sort of say that it doesn't, but I do think it's just sort of like worth acknowledging explicitly that it's a different thing than what I think Ethereum and Solana are trying to do. Patrick: How do you think about the future of everything on a blockchain? Do you think that we'll reach a state where every meaningful financial asset trades 24/7? You can see it by an open-order book, all the things that we spent the first chunk of our conversation talking about? I guess, that the future that we're heading towards? And if not, what gets in the way? What stops it? Sam: Not everything. So, blockchains are not the most economically efficient thing in the world. The most economically efficient thing is a single server, centralized server. And how much more efficient? Well, you probably have like 10,000 servers if you're a decentralized blockchain, all computing the same thing. A minimum latency of like a hundred milliseconds. So that's how long it takes light to travel around the world, which you need to do if you want to have a geographically decentralized blockchain.The question is, which things are not strongly constrained by latency or compute cost? Robinhood, not at all constrained by those, totally fine to be on a blockchain. Two HFT firms trading with each other, absolutely constrained by those. HFT firms are probably always going to be mostly trading against each other on centralized servers.If you think about Netflix, communicating about which movie you'd like to watch, what the recommendations are, selecting it, figuring out where to download it from, all of that can happen on a blockchain. Actually moving the video file, way too massive, not going to be economically efficient to do on chain. But you might have something like a twenty type protocol where you have effectively an on-chain protocol to communicate and then some off-chain protocol to actually send files to each other, or IPFS, or whatever.That's sort of my sense, is that the most compute constrained things will happen off-chain, but that there's a world. And I don't want to say this will happen, but it might happen, where most things that are not compute constrained and not latency constrained, end up at least partially on-chain. And that blockchain also forms sort of the connection layers between all of these things. Patrick: I've seen you write before about you personally having more RAM than hard drive space. Describe what you mean by that and whether or not you think more of the sort of key builders or entrepreneurs in the future will be defined in that same way? Sam: So what I mean by it is basically like, I suck at trivia, I'm not good at it. And so when you look like raw number of total facts that I can recall, I don't think I'm particularly good. I think where I'm a lot stronger is number of concepts I can hold in my head at once, and make a decision that references many things at once, in sort of like a nuanced way. I think that's where I'm much stronger. It's like much more relatively large amount of actively accessible memory and knowledge. Relatively less, sort of long-term storage of facts to be able to dredge up when needed.I sort of think it's pretty useful for being in a position where you have to be on top of a lot of things and you have to make sure not to lose important threads, which I think fits entrepreneurial role pretty well or the trader role, for that matter. I think if you look like a research role, it's less clear that that's the relevant archetype. It's more like focusing on one problem and diving deep into it. Patrick: So RAM is flexibility and that's rewarded in the world of entrepreneurship. Strange question is, you've amassed wealth faster than arguably anyone in history except maybe Zuckerberg. Has that felt weird? Does it affect you in unexpected ways? Do you care much? People I know you might get hit by at the least, but hard not to imagine getting hit by it somewhat. What has it been like psychologically to be on this ride? Sam: I think it hits me less than it would most people. I don't want to say it doesn't hit me at all, but I think it doesn't change how I feel about most things that much. It certainly changes how other people interact with me sometimes, especially people I don't know very well. And so that's taken some adjusting to, but I don't think it's like a huge change in my day-to-day life. Patrick: What have we not talked about that's consequential about the future, in your opinion? We've covered a lot of ground. There's 40 of my questions that we didn't get to, and we're almost out of time, so maybe we'll do it again. But what major muscle movements have we missed that you think are really important for people interested in this trend to consider or think about? Sam: One of the general themes that I've become more and more convinced by over time is that all the upside is in... all the expected value's in the upside tails and not in the median outcomes usually. And you should take that seriously. And it implies weird things, which I think are true. Like that often the right path is the one that very well might fail. You really should be thinking the whole time about what is the upside? What's it look like? Where is it? What can you do that will keep that in mind, even if you're not using it to make everyday decisions, but from a high-level strategy perspective.And I think that that sort of like, as the world speeds up and gets wackier, so that becomes more and more powerful and more and more important. And I think becomes more and more important to take that seriously and to acknowledge that sometimes things that sound crazy and unlikely, might be unlikely, but maybe not so unlikely, that they're not super valuable in expectation. I think a lot of the crypto industry has played out that way. I think that a lot of how I now, though did not always think about what I do, plays out that way. I think it's a pretty fundamental shift in how you think about what you're going to do. I think it is super important. Patrick: Is there a single decision that comes to mind when you think about this idea of kind of power laws ruling everything around us, that you most exemplifies this idea? Some decision you made because you were respecting this concept? Sam: When I certified FTX, I was the most optimistic, I think, of people on the team. And I thought there's a 20% chance of success and other people were lower. Sort of like did some math and it's like, ""Oh wow. It seems like very high upside. Plausible it could work. Very high expected value."" And I think that math turned out to be way too conservative.I think that as it turns out, I was still massively not appreciating the upside enough. But it was still way, way, way, kind of more extreme than I think what it was easy to get to. And just in general, I think that's sort of one of the clearest cases of, go for it. It seems high upside. Most people thought it wouldn't work. And it turned out that the straightforward analysis, expected value analysis, was the correct one. Patrick: So in the digital era, be bold, be different, seems to be the right strategy? Sam: Yeah. And be smart and do it well, obviously. Patrick: This has been such an interesting conversation. I literally do have like 40 questions I wasn't able to ask just because of time constraints, but so appreciate your time. I ask the same closing question of everybody. What is the kindest thing that anyone's ever done for you? Sam: There are maybe a few things there, but I think... And it's sort of the boring answer's like, supporting me, you know what I've been doing. I think, sort of believing that this might work when most people didn't and encouraging it.Maybe the thing that actually resonates a little bit more with me, I think have been like, a lot of the people in the effective altruism community who have, totally independent of me or anything, been incredibly dedicated and selfless with what they're doing with their life and achieve really spectacular things in a way that sort of involved making personal sacrifices and seeking the altruistic upside, if not the personal one. And those are the ones I think resonate more with me, in some sense. Patrick: Sam, it's been so much fun. I cannot wait to do round two with you. I'm sure, in a year we'll have enough to talk about or something. This has been a blast. Thanks so much for your time. Sam: Thank you.This site uses cookies to improve your browsing experience.
